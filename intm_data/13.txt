the history of the genus homo and the dozen human species we know of today through archaeological excavation was determined by the fight against infectious diseases it is likely that the species that are no longer around today are largely extinct due to the spread of infectious diseases 1 we should be happy that we no longer live in the times of great epidemics and pandemics that once decimated our species a huge number of people died during their childhood or youth 1the most severe mediaeval infections killed up to every third person before the discovery of the microscope people could not even know why it was happening to them no one thought that tiny invisible living microbes could cause these diseases people assumed that some heavenly punishment for their sins had come upon them we should therefore be grateful that we are living in the age of this advancement of science and medicine 1since 1940 many bacterial diseases have begun to be controlled by antibiotics and since 1960 many viral and bacterial diseases have had vaccines developed for them 1 unfortunately we do not have a vaccine for all infectious diseases as we see in the example of this pandemic new viruses continue to transfer from other species to us because history has not ended with the advent of our generation instead it just continues but this pandemic certainly does not look like it will decimate usit could have because this is already the seventh coronavirus to try to make itself at home within the human population 2 it is trying to adapt to us and use us as its reservoir specifically we exist together with this virus on a small blue-brown planet in a vast dark universe we share it with tens of millions of other species they all strive to barely survive more than 99of all species that have ever existed on earth have failed to survive to this day 1 that is why viruses constantly transfer themselves to new species and thus expand their reservoirs they must choose the winning species because they cannot reproduce on their own their survival depends on the survival of the species that is their reservoir 3humans are currently an interesting potential viral reservoir we are expanding rapidly in population size  from about a billion-and-a-half individuals we have grown to about seven-and-a-half-billion in the last 130 years alone 1 in doing so we are conquering new territories clearing forests draining wetlands hunting for pleasure and reducing overall biodiversity 1 this is making it increasingly difficult for others to survive while there are more and more of us fortunately for us all the first four human-adapted coronaviruses were merely the cause of common colds 2 no-one considered the four of them a serious threat to public healthsars severe acute respiratory syndrome and mers middle eastern acute respiratory syndrome were a real surprise for scientists and experts these were further respiratory viruses from the coronavirus family the fifth and sixth that managed to infect humans surprisingly instead of colds they were able to cause very severe fatal pneumonia 2 in addition the death rate among those infected with both diseases was truly frightening sars killed one-in-ten infected while mers killed one-in-three both could have caused a horrible amount of human deaths if they spread to the worlds entire population 2the coronavirus that caused sars had its reservoir in bats which hibernate in caves in winter this is the time of the year when hardly anyone hunts or consumes bats however sars managed to infect an animal from the cat family a civet from a civet it was then also contracted by a man a farmer in guangdong province in late 2002 sars then spread to more than twenty countries and infected more than 8000 people with every tenth infected person dying from the disease it was the fifth human coronavirus but it was the first to kill humans 2ten years later in 2012 the mers coronavirus appeared in saudi arabia it was passed on to humans from the camels in the desert it has also spread to more than twenty countries infecting about 2500 people and every third infected person died 2 so both sars and mers had a really scary case-fatality rate the advent of mers showed us that sars was not an isolated incident with a coronavirus that we could just forget about but that coronaviruses have become the most significant potential biological threat to our species if sars or mers had spread around the world and infected billions of people they would have caused a catastrophe unlike any other in the modern history of humansin those two cases we were actually very lucky essentially an entirely new virus that tries to transfer over to the human species can spread among humans in three basic ways each of these three ways informs our strategies for epidemic surveillance and dealing with the epidemic once the virus enters the human body it begins to multiply in the kind of specialised cells that it has the ability to bind to in the case of coronaviruses these are the cells of the respiratory system the virus multiplies in them by hacking their cellular genetic code and using their machinery to build its own proteins 2this multiplication of the virus eventually destroys the infected cells that is the reason for the eventual development of the symptoms that are characteristic of respiratory infections such as a sore throat and cough in the first mode of the spread the virus will jump from the infected person to unaffected people only after the onset of those symptomssuch an epidemic is the easiest to control and contain that is because the sick person is soon confined to bed and no longer leaves home therefore the virus can mainly spread to their household members this also makes it relatively easy to identify everyone who was in contact with the person after the onset of symptoms those people can then be placed in isolation quite easily we were fortunate that both sars and mers spread to other people only after the onset of the symptoms of the disease this is why we were able to suppress the epidemics by isolating those infected and all their contacts after the onset of the symptoms this is quite likely the most important reason why sars and mers did not manage to kill remarkably large number of people 2it is much more difficult to contain an epidemic if the virus spreads from infected to healthy people during the period of the so-called incubation this period lasts from the entry of the virus into the body until the onset of the first symptoms 3 in such case infected persons can transmit the virus by contact to a significantly larger number of people in the days before they get any symptoms that seems to be the situation with this new covid-19 pandemic but even then it is at least possible for every new patient to determine from whom they contracted the infection namely all newly diagnosed cases had to meet an existing and known case in the pastthis allows epidemiologists to follow the entire chain of movement of the virus from person to person due to this favourable circumstance intensive isolation measures of all those who were in contact with those already infected can significantly slow down the spread of the virus this was done in wuhan that is why test-trace-isolate as the first line of defence and quarantines as the ultimate response both represent a justified containment strategy when people are infectious for others during incubation period both approaches will slow down and contain the epidemic if applied properlya nightmare scenario for any epidemiologist however is a third possibility for the virus to spread in such a variant people become infected and transmit the virus but they themselves never show any symptoms scientists are currently looking for such possible spreads of contagion with this new covid-19 pandemic that is the reason why such possible persons are occasionally mentioned in the media in high-profile articlesnamely because of such infected people cases are beginning to emerge among the population that cannot be linked to any of the already infected people when people are circulating in the population without symptoms but passing the virus on to others it is very difficult for epidemiologists to do anything to prevent it from spreading among all humans such an epidemic has the potential to spread over time mainly due to such transmitters or carriers who show no symptomswhen something has happened six times within a system that is as complex as the earths ecosystem then it is no surprise that it would also happen for the seventh time another coronavirus is now trying to make itself at home in the human species in this case the primary reservoirs were probably bats again we know this because the genetic sequence of this new coronavirus coincides with that found in hibernating bats in about 96 percent 4 this time instead of a civet a smaller mammal or bird has probably served as coronavirus so-called transitional reservoirit is possible that it was a pangolin because in one of them a coronavirus that matched to the human form by as much as 99 of the sequence was found although this is not completely definite either 5 sequence matching is not the only important factor when it comes to viral jump from animals to humans what is also important is how many individuals in the species that serve as a transitional reservoir are infected and how often the species comes into contact with humans sometimes these factors are more important so they can bridge the gap of 2-3 of the difference in genome sequence because pangolins are a protected species and cannot be eatenthus in the chinese province of hubei in the city of wuhan which has a population of eleven million at around the end of 2019 the number of patients with an unusual and very dangerous type of pneumonia began to increase many of them had in common that they visited a particular fish market it was soon discovered that this infectious disease was spreading very quickly each infected person managed to further infect as many as two to three people such a degree of infectivity is quite high and leads to rapid growth of the epidemic we had the misfortune that the disease caused by the 7th coronavirus  covid-19  apparently manages to spread even during the incubation period possibly even by touchthis incubation period lasts about five days on average it would be very tricky if it lasted longer because the novel coronavirus would then have more time to spread from an already infected person to others however an incubation period of up to two weeks is not entirely unusual even rare cases who had incubation period of up to four weeks seem to be possible during some of this time the infected person can spread the virus before the onset of their first symptoms if there are infected people who do not develop symptoms it will be really difficult to contain this pandemic until we develop a vaccine in conclusion infectivity ie the ability to move from the infected to the uninfected seems to be significantly higher in covid-19 than it was with sars and mers as a trade-off we now know that the covid-19 case-fatality rate is significantly lower than that of sars and mersin order to answer this rather complicated question it must first be said that nowadays the registered number of infected persons and the number of deaths can be monitored online 6 when the number of deaths was divided by the confirmed and registered number of infected people at the beginning of the pandemic a figure of about 2 would be obtained 6 from this alone one could apparently conclude that  given that this is an entirely new coronavirus and nobody is immune to it  it will necessarily spread throughout the world and infect us all if it kills 2 percent of all people then it follows that out of a total of 75 billion people about 150 million will necessarily die it is difficult for anyone who is not a specialist in this field to understand how such an outcome can now be prevented because a vaccine against this virus does not yet exist nor do medicinesthe question of the case-fatality rate among those infected with covid-19 exposed a general lack of epidemiological knowledge among the general public and in the media from the very beginning of this pandemic there were people who claimed that the new coronavirus was a disease milder than even the flu but also those who believed it was significantly more dangerous in recent days this issue has finally caught the attention of all the worlds media as the world health organisation reported that about 34 of those infected with coronavirus have died 7 that sounded terrifying to the media and the publicbut then the president of the usa mr donald trump also made a public statement saying the number released by the who was wrong he said that hed talked to people who knew something about it and that his impression was that the number was certainly below 1 if not significantly less 8 in my guest appearance on sunday at 2 an influential croatian tv programme on march 1st i made an estimate of the case-fatality rate of 05-1 allowing for the possibility that it could even be smaller 9 namely at this point we do not properly distinguish infection-fatality rate from case-fatality rate so once that insights into seroprevalence become available they may even bring this estimate further downhowever both president trump and who are actually right each in their own way which shows best how difficult it is for many people to keep track of what is really going on because of their lack of knowledge of the epidemiologyin the beginning of every epidemic of a new virus the virus has to jump over from animals to humans and then from humans to humans that can be quite difficult therefore the virus will be more likely to successfully infect those with a weakened immune system who will find it more difficult to reject it because of this the first patients are often people who are either older or already have some underlying illnesses that make them more vulnerable they end up in a hospital where at that point no one suspects that pneumonia that they are experiencing may have an epidemic potentialthen they infect other hospital patients and some health care professionals the latter can then spread the disease to other patients in the hospital  mainly to those most susceptible such as those ailing or immunocompromised treated for serious illnesses or the elderly this is the reason why the case-fatality rate among all covid-19 patients was initially very high in wuhan and later in italy many people died of covid-19 infections in hospitals and they were mostly very old and sick people 10in the meantime the virus has started to spread among the general population  in the community and outside of hospitals it has infected many people who are otherwise healthy and had a much better immune response a large number of these people would have thought that they had a cold or the flu and perhaps even a more severe flu they were just resting at home and letting those respiratory infections run their course considering that it was flu season in wuhan at the time of the outbreak and the media reported that a strange epidemic was causing many deaths in wuhans hospitals it is quite likely that many wuhan residents who were infected with the coronavirus stayed home and treated themselvesfew people would choose to go to the hospital to test whether their flu-like symptoms were caused by the novel coronavirus when a deadly epidemic was spreading there only the few who have struggled with fevers and symptoms for more than eight or nine days sought help from wuhan hospitals in china there is typically no primary health care and family medicine as we know it but there are large hospitals in their huge cities where patients report directly that is the most likely explanation as to why the case-fatality rate among patients at wuhan hospitals at the beginning of the epidemic was so frighteningly highit is not the epidemic seemed even more dangerous at first as it created a great deal of pressure on hospital intensive care units which were unprepared for this infection as a result all severely ill patients could not receive intensive care this further increased the case-fatality rate at the beginning of the epidemic that is why the chinese have started building the two new hospitals they wanted to ensure a sufficient capacity to provide intensive care also they needed to move all those infected with covid-19 away from other seriously ill people who were sick from other diseases and at the highest risk of dying if they became infectedbased on this it should be understood that the total number of those infected with covid-19 in wuhan could have been much higher than what was confirmed by their health statistics specifically only those with coronaviruses who were eventually admitted to the hospital were confirmed to be infected and were tested for the new virus there they are by no means representative of all those infected with the new coronavirus in wuhantherefore the early estimates of case-fatality rates in wuhan cannot be extrapolated even to all those with confirmed coronavirus infection in wuhan let alone would they be representative of the entire population of wuhan for those reasons it is wrong to look at the number of deaths and the number of confirmed infected cases and divide those two numbers and draw any conclusions 11if all the reported deaths are divided by the total number of people with confirmed infection then both the numerator and the denominator are wrong when it comes to calculating the actual case-fatality rate even deaths in the numerator would be wrong this is because we monitor the confirmed infected and those who have died in real time a great many infected people have not even had a chance to either recover or die so the number of deaths in the numerator is an underestimatesome of the people who are presently in intensive care are expected to die in several days weeks maybe even months this is why the number of deaths that corresponds to the number presently infected will inevitably increase over time therefore some future number of deaths as the numerator will increasingly correspond to the current number of registered infected persons as the denominator as a result the case-fatality rate of deaths among those with confirmed infection will then no longer be 2 or 3 percent but it may increase quite considerably over time  perhaps to 6-7 percent or even moretherefore to simply say that about 34 of those confirmed to have been infected so far have died is not really wrong in itself which is what the world health organisation did but it missed explaining that this case-fatality rate among confirmed infected people is quite unrepresentative of the mortality rate among all those who were infected 11 the true rate should be much lower it would not surprise me as an epidemiologist if it is up to ten times smaller perhaps even more 11 depending on the actual true number of infected people which should be used as a denominator this could ultimately make covid-19 a less deadly disease even than the common flugiven that the virus is new and unknown this is a key question unfortunately the possibility that this virus is quite different from other known viruses must also be allowed it may be that the case-fatality rate among confirmed infected people is only 3 to 5 times higher than the infection-fatality rate ie the number of deaths among all infected people so it may not be ten or thirty times higher as many epidemiologists would expect the only thing we can be reasonably sure of is that the number of confirmed infected people was not equal to the number of all infected people in wuhan the current global totals of confirmed infected and fatalities for covid-19 are still largely determined by what happened in wuhan at the beginning of the epidemic this is because about two-thirds of cases worldwide still originate in wuhan to this day 6that is why i have already explained on sunday at 2 tv programme that the case-fatality rate among those who were confirmed to be infected is not so important it is only a subset of the patients with the most severe symptoms we need to find out what is the case-fatality rate among all infected people however no one can know that at this time because a random sample of at least 100 000 wuhan residents would need to be tested for this then the presence of antibodies against coronaviruses should be detected this is how we measure seroprevalence 3this would allow us to estimate the number of people in wuhan who got over the infection with the novel coronavirus without ever seeing a doctor so far no one has conducted these studies because the health system was preoccupied with diagnosing and treating the epidemic of covid-19 in hospitals and struggled with it it is now understood that during some days of the wuhan outbreak there were not enough tests for all those who reported to hospitals with symptomshowever additional lines of evidence are beginning to emerge the first is the report of an international panel of experts who visited china 12 they looked at the cases across china that were reported after february the 1st at this point the identification of those infected was significantly improved also hospitals were better prepared for the epidemic case-fatality rate of all cases that came under health surveillance and were tested dropped to about 07 12for anyone who may remain skeptical of chinas data the first reports have recently been provided by south korean authorities that country has really led by example in proactively testing people seeking out all those infected and their contacts isolating them and treating them in their analyses to date case-fatality rate of all infected people has been slightly above 06 13 both of those estimates could still increase albeit not substantially if they also included those who will likely die over time and are currently counted as infected still at such a low case-fatality rate there should not be many additional deaths in fact it is more likely that many infected people remained undiagnosed and that the case-fatality rate is actually even lower 11another interesting recent new source is the study of more than 1000 hospitalized covid-19 patients who were followed up until the very end of the infection this sample has been collected from more than 500 chinese hospitals and the result was published recently in a leading medical journal 14 this analysis quoted their overall case-fatality rate to be about 14 however it did not include all those infected again but rather those who requested hospital treatment 14 therefore it should still be possible that the infection-fatality rate is at least two to three times smaller among all those who were infected with the novel coronavirusthus it appears that data from very different and increasingly reliable sources are starting to converge to the values which i predicted on sunday at 2 tv show on march 1st ie 05-1 because of all of the above president of the usa donald trump was most likely right to say that this number should be closer to 1 and that he believes that it could even be well below 1 8 everything we know about epidemiology and previous pandemics gives us hope that this should be the casethe virus will not succeed in infecting everyone for a number of reasons our first line of defence consists of anti-epidemic measures all those who are experiencing symptoms and may be infected are being tested all their contacts are also tested for the presence of the virus then covid-19 patients and all their contacts are being isolated 15these measures will significantly slow down the spread of the infectious disease and buy us time it is of utmost importance that the number of patients with covid-19 does not increase too quickly when the new cases emerge more slowly the staff of national health care systems will be able to provide quality care to all patients for the more severe cases they will also offer intensive care in the absence of these measures there would be an exponential increase in the number of infected people this number would soon outgrow the capacity of the health system many people within countries are also protected by their geographical dispersion ie many people live in smaller towns and settlements a large number of them will probably never be exposed to an infected personfurthermore as people become infected develop covid-19 and then get well they should become immune to the virus as a result there will be fewer people the virus can still infect at some point the number of susceptible persons that infected people can spread coronavirus to will decrease substantially at some point each infected person will on average pass the virus to less than one susceptible person in time this will eventually limit and stop the epidemic that is the reason we vaccinate even if the virus infects some unvaccinated people it will have very few options for further spread vaccinated people will already be immune to the virus and their bodies will react vigorously if the virus tries to enter 16 many processes in nature are self-limiting in a similar way  forest fires stock market crashes and epidemicsfurthermore the case-fatality rate should not be directly applicable to the entire population of a country to estimate the possible death toll the first reason is that the virus mainly endangers the elderly whose case-fatality rates are much higher young people and children rarely get unwell and their death rates are much much lower this is why age and sex structure of the population can diminish the potential of the virus to cause a very high number of covid-19 casualties if the population is reasonably young 11the situation should be taken seriously and people should be cautious but there is no reason to be overly afraid there is especially no reason to panic many people are afraid of this pandemic because they probably think that we are in a completely unfamiliar situation so anything could happen but it is unlikely that much could happen for which science could not find explanations and answers and the epidemiological services could not respond in a timely manner it is unwise for a serious scientist to try to predict the spread of a completely new and unknown virus to the entire human population in the world let alone to predict more specific outcomes still we have in recent weeks collected enough information about the new covid-19 virus for at least some predictionsif the new coronavirus spreads across any country over time and manages to circumvent the many prevention measures in place the application of anti-epidemic measures should still limit its casualties to make them at least roughly comparable to the deaths from flu or road accidents in the same period this means that some healthy caution is advisable this caution is reasonable as long as it is on the same level as the fear you may feel when sitting in a car and preparing for a longer trip or when you hear on the news that a more severe form of influenza has arrivedbut many are wondering why the novel coronavirus attracts such a level of media attention this is because flu has been a well-known disease for decades it comes back every year and we have experience with its manifestations among many millions of patients worldwide we know how to develop vaccines against flu in advance of its season 16 we have even started to produce the first somewhat effective drugs and offer them on the market 17 unlike the flu the new coronavirus is unknown to us we should remain cautious so that we do not get unpleasantly surprised at the same time the most vulnerable among us who are already seriously ill or very old are not vaccinated as is the case with the flu this is why the new disease covid-19 can kill more easilythis question has constantly been being raised since the beginning because many are looking at various figures without a deeper understanding of their background and are comparing the incomparablefirst of all the general public underestimates how serious and dangerous and serious the flu actually is  especially for the most vulnerable the elderly and those who are already ill globally influenza causes between 250 000 and 650 000 deaths annually depending on the strain of the circulating virus 18 different strains can cause milder or more severe symptoms and the virus mutates each year however we try to protect those most vulnerable before the flu season begins by vaccinating themtherefore the number of deaths from influenza is reduced by preventive health intervention ie vaccination this cannot be done with the spread of covid-19 this is the first reason why the flu seems less dangerous than covid-19 however it may not be much less dangerous inherently especially during seasons when flu is more severe it is just that we protect the most vulnerable in addition flu vaccinations make it more difficult for it to spread among the population because there are fewer options for it to transfer to the uninfected due to the slower spread new cases emerge more slowly and the health care system has time to deal with them properly especially if they require intensive careanother reason is that the number of deaths directly from the flu is several times lower than the number of deaths that are indirectly caused by the flu influenza is often not cited as a direct cause in statistics on the causes of death if it has merely led to the exacerbation of some of the long-present chronic underlying disease these chronic diseases are then cited as the primary cause of death rather than influenza therefore the actual role of influenza in annual mortality is often significantly underestimated it can be several times higher when the causes of death are reclassified at the end of each year based on the increase in deaths from chronic diseases during the flu seasonthe third reason for caution in comparing covid-19 and flu is that we have a much better idea of the total number of people truly infected with the flu than we do about the novel coronavirus this is because influenza is a disease that is typically managed within primary care after which patients are referred to home care only the most serious cases of flu are referred to hospitalthere is an obligation to report the total number of people infected with influenza in the population to the central registry as well as for sick leave this makes the denominator for case-fatality rate of influenza better known to us than we can estimate it for the novel coronavirus covid-19 has so far been diagnosed and treated exclusively in hospitals where severe cases clustered the early estimates of case-fatality rates for covid-19 included patients suffering from hospital outbreaks which affected the elderly the sick and the immunocompromised this is why those case-fatality rates are hardly comparable to a spread that would occur in the general populationfrom all of this it should be concluded that case-fatality rates from influenza as another very dangerous viral disease have been mathematically reduced compared to the current reports of case-fatality rates for coronaviruses for the three reasons i mentioned the first is because we vaccinate those most vulnerable to the flu the second is that health statistics do not assign the majority of flu deaths to influenza but rather to the exacerbations of pre-existing underlying illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes malignant tumours and others the third is that the denominator we use to calculate case-fatality rates from influenza is much closer to the actual number of those infected while the denominator for coronavirus is not yet known with sufficient certainty from their experience with other respiratory viruses epidemiologists know that all events in hospitals will dramatically over-represent the most vulnerable this is why those case-fatality rates should by no means be applied to the general populationhowever lay members of the public cannot have a good sense of these nuances that is why it is best to avoid comparisons between case-fatality rates for the flu and for the novel coronavirus until we learn more on the seroprevalence of the latter the general public underestimates the risk of influenza for the three reasons mentioned above they are also likely to overestimate the risk of the new coronavirus due to its intense media focus if influenza infections and deaths were monitored in the same way each year the public would realise how dangerous the flu really is and how reasonable it is to be vaccinated against ittherefore it still does not seem possible to me at least at this stage of the pandemic to decisively state which of the two diseases is inherently more dangerous to human beings or which will eventually cause more human deaths in 2020 flu will cause fewer deaths because the most vulnerable will be vaccinated and health statistics will not properly attribute many indirect deaths to flu which really caused them covid-19 in turn will cause fewer deaths due to epidemiological surveillance the prevention of its spread and possible strict quarantine it may also have seasonal characteristics and simply disappear with the arrival of late springwhen we have no other means of defending ourselves against the new virus all we can really do is retreat indoors and prevent the virus from jumping from infected to healthy individuals too quickly people generally do not have an intuitive sense of exponential growth if each newly infected person infects just one more person each day the number of newly infected people will increase from 2 to 16 during the early phase which does not seem like a big increasea little later it will jump to 1024 infected people from 128 over the next three days and that does not sound so terrible either but there will also come four days in which the number of newly infected people will increase from 100 000 to 800 000when china realised that the covid-19 epidemic was out of control and that it already entered this explosive phase the authorities immediately cut off wuhan and then fifteen other cities from the rest of the country in addition the authorities ordered that the population within these cut-off areas stay in their apartments and not leave it was an unprecedented measure in human history  tens of millions of people were quarantined for weeks everything stopped 12however this measure produced excellent results and china could keep its death toll below 5000 although the epidemic caught them unprepared and the virus spread to all chinese provinces a recent report from the world health organisations commission made up of 25 international experts visiting china concluded the followingchinas bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic faced with an unknown virus china has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history 12this may be because on these large ships people are mostly older one should look very closely at the age and gender structure of passengers which would tell us more about the final outcome it is also quite possible that a mutated version of the virus which is somewhat more dangerous could have entered such a pocket such isolated groups can always emerge and the disease may actually run a more severe course there this is possible but not very likely also this case-fatality rate should not be extrapolated to the entire country for the same reasononce the virus begins to spread through the entire human species it will continue to mutate it will try to adapt to humans as quickly as possible according to previous epidemiological experiences many of those mutations should make it less dangerous for human health as this would lead to a better adaptation however some random mutations could make it more dangerous to us this is why we need to be on our guard until we get better acquainted with the virus and the pandemic is over it is unlikely that the novel coronavirus will mutate to become significantly more dangerous than it is now but we will only be able to assert that with certainty when the pandemic is overthese are very difficult questions to answer until we get more quality data from both countries in principle it is possible that the first entry of the virus into a new country may be through an infected person in whom the virus has mutated into a more severe form if all further cases arise from that mutant then the situation in those countries may initially seem more difficult than elsewhere in population genetics this development is known as the so-called founder effect 19 however patterns of spread and case-fatality rates in both countries may also have many different explanationsthe reason why the death toll among infected people in italy appears to be very high is because the disease is spreading in small-town hospitals and elderly care homes which were completely unprepared for the epidemic the elderly and infirm are at much greater risk of dying if they become infectedcase-fatality rates in hospital outbreaks where older sick and immunocompromised people are affected will be much higher than those in the community among younger and healthy people among the first several hundred deaths in italy almost all people were over 60 years of age and had underlying illnesses 20 that is why the case-fatality rate seems so high there but it is not representative of the entire population a harsh flu season would probably have done similar damage if people had not been vaccinated against it but it is also possible that there are many more cases in the population than previously thought because the virus has been spreading for a long time in iran however the situation is unclear so far the most likely explanation too is that there are already significantly more cases of infection among the population than it was thought initiallyif covid-19 proves to be significantly more dangerous than seasonal influenza then one million deaths worldwide could indeed be expected perhaps significantly more unfortunately such a scenario is still possible in principle with a virus that is new and unknown to us for a variety of reasons because of this all experts in the field including myself are constantly urging people to take caution but without the unnecessary panicin which scenarios could the situation become much more difficult first most epidemiologists based on their experience with previous epidemics and pandemics expect the covid-19 case-fatality rate to fall below 1 when the total death toll is divided by a better estimate of the total number of infected people however the virus is new so it is possible in principle for this specific virus that the number of infected individuals who are not confirmed through testing may not be as large as epidemiologists would expect this would come as a surprise to science and would indicate a different nature of this virusthe new coronavirus causing covid-19 is somewhat similar to that caused by sars the sars pathogen however had a much higher case-fatality rate if the total population infected by the novel coronavirus is found to be higher than the registered infected population by only two or three times and not by eg ten times or more then the case-fatality rate of those infected with covid-19 could be significantly higher than the flucombined with the lack of an available vaccine in such a case it would lead to a significantly higher number of deaths than the flu however such an occurrence should still be prevented by measures of isolation of the patients and their contacts as well as by quarantines which are not applied in the case of flu we also hope that with the winter ending and the new seasons arriving seasonality would slow down or completely hinder the further spread of the virusfurthermore the virus could spread to infected people in some of its more dangerous forms as well as in milder forms previous experiences with epidemics have shown that mutation into milder forms is more likely but mutation into more dangerous forms or those that are more easily spread is not impossible either 3 in some countries such a variant would increase the case-fatality rate locally compared to other countries or accelerate infectionthis would put their health systems in a really difficult situation as intensive care units would soon become overburdened with poorer care available case-fatality rate of all those infected would increase further with the likely collapse of part of the health system it is also a very tricky scenario in which many health care professionals would become infected over time in providing care to patients which would make the situation worsetherefore currently perhaps the most important citizens of any country are health care professionals who work in hospitals for infectious diseases especially in their intensive care units they should be protected not only from work overload but also from coronavirus infection by their patients with the increasing number of infected people with severe forms of disease the demand for quality intensive care respirators and ecmo devices for extracorporeal oxygen enrichment will become the bottleneck of the health care system the same is true for healthy and well rested doctors and nurses in these wards those parts of the health system should be amplified and further strengthened before they come under increased pressurethe worst-case scenario imaginable right now is the entry of some more dangerous mutated version of coronavirus into one of the very poor countries in the world with a dysfunctional health system such countries cannot implement satisfactory quality epidemiological surveillance measures then a more dangerous version of the virus would likely infect a larger percentage of the countrys population relatively quickly panic would ensue probably also a black market for the transport of migrants to other countries then a more severe variant of covid-19 would start to expand uncontrollably and in a whole new wayin the event of any of these unfavourable developments all of which are unfortunately possible though not likely an entirely new protection strategy would be required each country will have its own approach when the death toll in each of the affected countries begins to rise so much as to cause fear among the population people will become increasingly willing to undertake much stricter epidemiological measures in such a case an increasing number of countries will resort to a solution that has proven effective in wuhan  ie declaring large very strict quarantines it is essential to buy time in such quarantines so that health systems do not become overburdened we should then anticipate the end of winter and hope that there would be evidence of possible seasonality of this virus it may then begin to spread in a weakened manner or disappear altogether at least until next winterthere are at least several reasons for optimism first of all epidemiological surveillance and first lines of defence are currently in place throughout the european union if they work well in most countries it is possible that their outbreaks will be controlled and would not enter a phase of exponential growth in the number of infected cases in the most favourable scenario with this retention this novel coronavirus would show seasonality then it would gradually disappear from circulation among humans with changes in nature characteristic of late spring and summer 3 however this is the most favourable scenario in which the final death toll would be much lower than that already caused by the flu this yearhowever if the front line of defence and epidemiological surveillance is broken through by the virus then governments will resort to strict measures to ban assemblies and organise quarantines as the chinese did several models done in recent weeks indicate that strict quarantine should completely suppress the spread of this coronavirus within up to three months 21 this is exactly what we have already seen in china that is why it seems that one great positive lesson of this pandemic is that humanity today would be able to survive even more dangerous infectious diseases than covid-19 with strict quarantine in which people would remain until scientists developed vaccines in this unusual situation this answer has been revealed to us allfinally the tireless work of numerous scientists currently testing over a hundred drugs against this virus as well as at least eleven experimental vaccines should be noted 22 it is not impossible that some existing medicines may show some effect and be repurposed to treat covid-19 also vaccines should become available over time in this unusual situation emergence of an effective drug or a vaccine could make a sudden and important differencewe should try to find something good in all the bad things that seem to be happening many people may finally realise how dangerous flu is more of them may start getting vaccinated against it each year the flu kills between 250 000 and 650 000 people worldwide 18in china which is one-sixth of the worlds population the death toll from covid-19 could be stopped below 5000 by the wuhan quarantine if all other countries could implement anti-epidemic measures like china then the death toll from covid -19 could be at most six times higher ie up to 30 000 that would be ten times fewer deaths than the total number of deaths caused annually by seasonal influenza unfortunately many countries will not be able to follow chinas example closely and will have uncontrolled outbreaks if the warmer season does not stop the spread of the virusfurthermore if the virus continues to spread throughout 2020 it will demonstrate in a very cruel way how well the leadership and public health systems of individual countries function it will be possible to produce performance charts for each country in controlling this new infectious disease given the population size and age structure these will be very important lessons to learn in preparation for a future pandemic which could be even more dangerousadditionally viruses generally spread by contact this means that it is good to be reminded that hands should be regularly and properly washed during epidemics and touching surfaces that many people touch should be avoided knobs handrails atms shaking hands should also be avoided and we should keep at least two steps away from people who have symptoms of respiratory infections it is also advisable to regularly ventilate all living quarters it is also helpful to strengthen personal immunity with sufficient sleep exercise and good nutritionwe all hope at this point march 7 2020 that there would be very few i explained why it is no surprise that after the previous six coronaviruses the seventh has now also managed to infect humans nor is its spread rate a surprise as there are both more and less infectious respiratory viruses 3 it would be somewhat surprising for epidemiologists if the total number of infected people in the population was not significantly higher than the number of registered infected people in such occurrence case-fatality rate would indeed become significantly higher than that of the flu we should continue to await the information of well-conducted studies on this key questionperhaps the biggest surprises so far have been related to the clinical course of covid-19 rather than its epidemiology for now clinicians in china have reported that registered infected people report to the hospital rather late on average after as many as 9-12 days of home care 23 this may reflect their fear of being admitted to the hospital during an epidemic but it may also be an interesting feature of an illness with slow development in comparison to other respiratory infections furthermore fever does not appear to always accompany other symptoms of the disease in the first few days making it difficult to identify possibly contagious cases by controlling peoples temperatures 23the media has also reported on the possible return of the virus after suffering from the infection in some cases 24 for now it is hard to know how common these cases are and how many exceptions there are it is often wise to rest well after many viral respiratory infections to allow the body to recover after the infection has ended it is unknown whether this infection can return if the immune system has not completely removed the virus from the body but with all new and unknown viruses such surprises are possible so one should be careful until the pandemic is overin all the answers provided in this editorial i endeavoured to convey the most likely scientific explanations for the abundant information that is published about covid-19 in the domestic and international media over time some of the likely scientific explanations may need to be modified in the light of new information one should not forget that this is a new and unknown virus therefore surprises and deviations from the expected scenarios are in principle possible that is why i emphasise that caution is needed but not panic the community of scientists and health experts will continue to closely monitor the further development of the pandemicobviously we need to prepare for a very serious flu-like illness against which no-one will be able to be vaccinated against for quite a while therefore elderly people and those with underlying illnesses should be extremely careful because the infection is the most dangerous for them having gained our first knowledge of covid-19 we now need to concentrate on preventing the spread of the virus and buying time until the arrival of warmer days then we might be lucky enough to see the virus slowly disappearing due to seasonality unfortunately we cannot know that right now from everything written here it should be understood that all measures of active searching and the isolation of affected patients and their contacts are justifiedthese also include bans on gathering together larger groups of people as well as possible quarantine if the epidemic starts to elude epidemiological control particularly older people should be looked after because the probability of a bad outcome increases significantly with age in addition those with heart disease diabetes or undergoing cancer treatment should take special carein order to handle crises like the covid-19 crisis governments and decision makers at all levels are pressed to make decisions in a very short time span based on very limited information rosenbaum 2020 where italy and later spain are criticized by not being quick enough to react on the spread of the sars-cov-2 virus one wonders whether others would have made different decisions at that time although health is considered of the prime importance the interventions from governments are having huge economic impacts and possibly even bigger socio-psychological impact because the incubation time of the coronavirus is around two weeks it will take at least two weeks before the effects of any restriction on movements is visible that is decisions will everytime be two weeks behind the actual situation given this fact many countries made a jump start and installed possibly more severe restrictions than necessary in order to stay ahead of the effect however it also means that in many countries the restrictions will last for several more months extended lockdown and restrictions on movement are leading to social stress and the economic effects will have lasting consequences too it can be expected that people will find unforeseen ways to circumvent the restrictions and there will be increased attempts to violate the restrictions all potentially undoing the effects of the restrictionat the same time lockdowns are causing social stress unemployment in several countries is rising at an incredible speed causing even more social unrest this is pushing the timing and type of strategies to exit lockdown and lessen the current restrictions leading many governments to consider the introduction of tracking apps or other means to limit spread once restrictions are partially lifted in order to limit the risks of a second or third pandemic wave how and when should restrictions be lifted is it better to first re-start schools or should transport and work take priority what will be the effect of these strategies on the pandemic but also on the economy and social life of people and countries it is also clear that interests and possibilities are not equal for all countries thus a preliminary lifting of restrictions in one country might adversely affect the spread in the neighbouring countries unless all cross border transport is halted which is almost impossible given the economic and food dependencies between countries worldwidethe above considerations make clear that health social-psychological and economical perspectives are tightly coupled and all have a huge influence on the way the society copes with the covid-19 crisis epidemiology the study of the distribution and determinants of diseases in humans is a cornerstone of public health and shapes policy decisions and evidence-based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and targets for preventive healthcare as such it is not strange that during the initial times of the covid-19 pandemic decision makers got their main advice from epidemiologists epidemiology assumes that risk factors are general abstract and difficult for an individual to control however individual behavior has a direct influence on these risks as it became evident in the spread of the coronavirus the study of individual and societal behaviors are therefore necessary to the taken into account next to epidemiological studies in order to be able to understand the combined effect of any policy measure across all aspectsthis is especially serious if the effects of a restriction or the lifting of a restriction have an effect in one perspective that invalidates the assumptions made from another perspective bnassy-qur et al 2020 there is thus a need for ways to couple the different perspectives and model the interdependencies such that these become visible and understandable this will facilitate balanced decision making where all perspectives can be taken into account tools like the one we propose should thus facilitate the investigation of alternatives and highlight the fundamental choices to be made rather than trying to give one solutionin this paper we present assocc agent-based social simulation for the covid-19 crisis an agent-based social simulation tool that supports decision makers gain insights on the possible effects of policies by showing their interdependencies and as such making clear which are the underlying dilemmas that have to be addressed such understanding can lead to more acceptable solutions adapted to the situation of each country and its current socio-economic state and that is sustainable from a long term perspectivein the next section we will briefly discuss the current covid-19 crisis situation in sect 3 we will discuss the different perspectives of the consequences of the crisis and show what is needed to connect the different perspectives in sect 4 we describe the agent architecture at the core of the assocc approach which brings together the epidemiologic social and economic perspectives and show how this is implemented in a workable agent architecture that can be used in a social simulation framework in sect 5 we describe the practical application of the social simulation framework assocc by exploring different example scenarios where the different perspectives are combined conclusions are drawn in sect 6the covid-19 crisis is characterized by very emotional debates and an atmosphere of crisis and panic khosravi 2020 when the pandemic spread from asia to europe it took some time to realise its possible consequences and what would be appropriate measures to prevent these consequences also the usa seemed to ignore what was happening in asia and europe for some time causing a considerable delay in introducing defensive policies when the pandemic finally reached the country in a country like the usa where little social security exists and government is not prepared to invest money in preparing for disasters the societal consequences are possibly even larger than in europe hick et al 2020 this was also one of the lessons learned from the storm katrina executive-office 2006 but the lack of preparedeness still remains in the usa alone already by end march 2020 over 66 million americans had filed for unemployment1as the number of covid-19 cases increased policies had to be made quickly in order to prevent the rapid spread of the virus resulting in an overload of hospital and ic capacity given the lack of data about the coronavirus at the time of decision making epidemic models based on those modeling earlier influenza epidemics were leading on making decisions there was simply not enough information and not enough possibilities to take more focused measures that would target the right groups and still had the desired effect the early days of the pandemic show a quick change of approaches as more became known about the coronavirus eg the fact that in early stages it was believed that asymptomatic carriers were not able to transmit the virus was influential in initial decisions concerning testing and contact tracing and possibly to the high speed at which the virus spread initiallycurrently many countries have introduced severe movement restrictions and full lockdown policies with potentially huge social and economic consequences however also in these cases it is unclear what are the factors and motivations leading to the policy in fact an initial study by oxford university shows that there is little correlation between the severity of the spread of the coronavirus and the stringency of the policies in place in different countries2 the initial idea was that these measures would last for one or two months however at the moment there are already several countries speaking about a period of several months extending at least until mid 2020 or even longerbased on data from previous pandemics initial economic policies were based on the expectation of getting back to normal within a limited amount of time with many governments soldering the costs for the current period it is increasingly clear that impact may be way above what governments can cope with and a new normal economy will need to be found bnassy-qur et al 2020 and above that the international dependencies of the world economy require that countries should coordinate their policies in order to sort maximum effect a thing which is notoriously difficult and has not been improved by the recent attitude of the usa to go for its own interests first and show little solidarity with other countriesfrom a sociological perspective there are not many theories that can be used to predict how the current situation will develop however some principles are clear people have fundamental needs for affiliation and thus need to socialize people can use the internet for some of these needs but physical proximity to other people is a basic need and cannot be withheld for a long period without possibly severe consequences keeping families locked up in their homes for long periods also will create problems of its own even without considering the particular dangers for disfunctional families and domestic violence victims new practices need to be formed where all members of the family will experience less privacy and autonomy and have to adjust their daily practices to accommodate the new situation this is possible for short periods as tensions can be kept in reign however over long periods this might lead to conflicts and consequent problems of distress increased domestic violence suicides etc cluver et al 2020 these experiences might also affect families and society on the long term people will change their behavior permanently to avoid similar situations thus eg people might be less inclined to travel get close to other people etc the effects of these changes can be more subtle but have a long lasting effect on the well being of societyfrom the considerations above may be clear that policies impact epidemics economics and society differently and that a policy that may be beneficial from one perspective may lead to disastrous consequences from another perspective as the crisis progresses and with it its impact increases decision makers need to be aware of the complexity of the combined impact of policies means to support understanding this complexity are sorely needed as are tools that enable the design and analysis of many what-if scenarios and potential outcomesin this section we describe the epidemics economics and social science models that are needed to support decision makers on policies concerning the covid-19 crisis and the complexity of combining these modelsepidemiological models are dominated by compartmental models of which sir cope et al 2018 or seir formulations are the most commonly usedin compartmental models people are divided into compartments as depicted in fig 1 seir shows how people start as being susceptible to a virus s then can become exposed e to the virus from that state they can become infected documentclass12ptminimal

				begindocumenti2enddocumenti2 from those states they can still visit a doctor and in the end they are either recovered r or passed away once recovered people can become susceptible again if immunity does not last the spread of the virus is determined by the probabilities with which persons move from one state to the next of course this figure gives a very simple picture of all complexities involved in epidemic models however what is clear from this picture is that people are a kind of passive containers of the virus that can infect others with a probability and can recover and become immune there are no explicit actions that people undertake a model like the above is often combined with a social network model that shows the speed of the spread along certain dimensions when a person gets infected that is central in the network he will spread the virus in all directions and the epidemic spreads quick as wellthese models are mathematical simplifications of infectious diseases and allow for understanding how different situations may affect the outcome of the epidemic by assuming that every person in the same compartment exhibit the same characteristics that is the model does not consider explicit human behaviour as is also explained in the media nowadays3 or consequences of interventions on actions of people heesterbeek et al 2015 these are either considered outside of the model or are transformed into an estimated effect on the parameters of the seir model that is uniform for all individuals in one compartment eg the effect of closing schools on the spread of the corona virus can be interpreted as a lowering of factor documentclass12ptminimal

				begindocumentdeltaenddocument in fig 1 meaning a lower number of places where the spread of the virus is possible and thus a lower probability for the virus to spread however what if the consequence of closing schools would be that children are staying with their grandparents or that they are brought together at the homes of other children rotating caring between families in these cases the number of places where the virus can spread may actually increase which might outweigh the effect of closing the schools it is possible to include all these factors in to the probability factor however by doing so we loose the actual causal links between the different factors as these are not explicit part of the model and therefore cannot be easily identified and adjustedin economics there are many competing models and theories without singling out a specific model it can be said that in general economic models have difficulties in times of crisis kirman 2010 colander et al 2009 competing theories focus on different aspects of the economy and make different assumptions about the rest the main issue all models struggle with exactly like epidemiological models is that of human behavior often economic models take a homo economicus view on human behavior a rational individual that always goes for maximum utility or profit in all circumstances however we all know this is not always true as can be easily illustrated by the ultimatum game an experimental economics game in which one player proposes how to divide a sum of money eg 100 dollars with the second party if the second player rejects this division neither gets anything rationally the agent that gets offered should accept any offer as it is more than nothing what he gets when refusing however empirical studies show that people only accept what they perceive as fair offers andersen et al 2011 in our example when more than 30-40 dollars are offered so fairness apparently also is worth something it neatly illustrates that people have more motivations to take actions than mere utility of that action again such motivations and values can be somehow incorporated in economic models but such interpretation is not part of economic theory ie economics does not directly provide an answer on how much fairness is worth this will depend from the context and history eg suppose an agent is pretty fair and offers the other agent 49 dollars and the other agent accepts the next time the same agent offers the other agent 45 but now the other agent refuses due to the fact he feels he will get offered less and less however he might very well have accepted the 45 if it was offered the first time the above is just one example to show that economic models are very good to explain and predict some behavior of people but do not include all motivations and behaviors following from thosethe third perspective that is relevant for modeling of a pandemic is the social science in particular social network analysis is often used to understand the possible ways a virus might spread firestone et al 2011 nowadays much of the work in this area is related to online social media networks because a lot of data is easily available on such networks however for the spread of a virus the physical social networks between friends family colleagues etc are those of main interest given that there is enough data to construct the physical social networks they are a very good tool to determine which people might potentially be big virus spreaders this can be due to their role eg nurses in elderly care or due to the fact that they have many contacts in different contexts eg sports and culture that are otherwise sparsely connected and they form bridges between densely connected communities however knowing which people or which roles one would like to target for controlling the spread does not mean one can device effective policies eg in the current pandemic it is clear that closing schools as being a possible bridge between communities is acceptable while closing hospitals or elderly care centres is not so again additional aspects have to be included in these models in order to use the theory in practice more semantics for the nodes in the networks are needed as well as what the links between the nodes are constituted of do the links indicate the number of contacts per day can people also change the network based on their perception of a situation ie avoid contacts have different types of contacts establish new contacts etc so where social network analysis looks at people as nodes in a network people are the ones that actually create maintain and change the social network when a government tries to contain the spread of a virus the social networks give a good indication where that might be done most effective but how the people constituting the network will react to the policies is not included in the social network theory thus whether new links will arise bypassing previous links or other persons will take the place of so-called super spreaders cannot be derived from this theorygiven the above short discussions of the different modeling perspectives of the crisis one can conclude that all perspectives include some assumptions about human behavior in their models however this behavior and especially how people influence each others behavior is not part of any of these models we propose to take the human behavior as the central perspective and use it as a linking pin to connect the different perspectives as illustrated in fig 2 in the next section we will discuss how our agent model from the assocc framework can be used to fulfill this central role to couple the different perspectivesthe design of the assocc framework is based on the fact that individuals always have to balance their needs over many contexts in the research that we have done in the past twenty years we have come to the the sketch in fig 3 that illustrates how people manage this balancing act in their daily life we assume that people have a value system that is reasonably consistent both over times contexts and domains the value system is based on the schwartz value circumplex schwartz 1994 that is quite universal it depicts a number of basic values that everyone possesses and their relations people differ in how they prioritize values rather than on which values they have although priorities can differ between individuals they are reasonably consistent within cultural groups therefore the values can also be seen as linking individual drivers to the social group we have used this abstract social science framework already in vanhee et al 2011 vanhe 2015 cranefield et al 2017 heidari et al 2018 in order to use it in these simulations we have formalized and extended the framework such that it can be coupled to concrete behaviour preferences in each context thus values give a stable guideline of behavior and they will be kept satisfied to a certain degree whenever possible thus if conservatism is important to a person she will in general direct her behavior to things that will benefit the preservation of the communitythe second type of drivers of behavior in fig 3 are the motives that all people have in common this is based on the theory of mcclelland 1987 the four basic motives that are distinguished areachievementaffiliationpoweravoidancethe achievement motive drives us to progress from the current situation to something better whatever better might mean the affiliation motive drives us to be together with other people and socialize thus we sometimes do things just to be doing it together with our friends and family the power motive actually does not mean we want power over others but rather that we want to be autonomous ie being able to do tasks without anyones help finally the avoidance motive lets us avoid situations in which we do not know how to behave or what to expect from others each of these motives is active all the time and whenever possible it will drive a concrete behavior thus i might go to my grandparents to ask a question rather than text them just because i want to have a chatthe third type of elements that determine behavior are the affordances that a context provides these affordances determine what kind of behavior is available and also what type of behavior is salient eg in a bar one often drinks alcohol even though it is not obligatory it is salient and also afforded easily individuals have to balance between their values their motives and the affordances to determine what behaviour would be more appropriate in each situation as one can imagine this is quite tricky and will take too much time and energy if done in every situation from scratch therefore in human society we have developed social structures to standardize situations and behaviors in order to package certain combinations that will be acceptable and usually good even if not optimal these social constructs are things like norms conventions social practices organizations institutions note that these constructs give general guidelines or defaults of behavior but are no physical restrictions on what is possibleimplementing this whole architecture would be too inefficient for any social simulation therefore we use this as theoretical starting point but translate it into a simpler model that is more efficient and scalable thus for the assocc simulation framework we fix the the most important aspects of the values and motives described in the above architecture into a set of needs illustrated in the following fig 4from the figure it can be seen that we model the values and motives as needs that deplete over time if nothing is done to satisfy them the model prevents that an agent will only look at the need with the highest priority and only at other ones when that need is completely satisfied by calibrating the size and threshold and the depletion rate of each need we can calibrate and balance all the needs over a longer period between different contexts and over several domains eg using this model it becomes possible to decide for an individual whether it is more important to work a bit more or go home and be with the family this simple model is the crux behind combining health wealth and social wellbeing in a simulation model fig 5for our implementation of the covid-19 crisis situation we have selected the following five needs that combine some values and motives that are more salient in the current crisis situationsafety representing the motive of avoidance and the conservation valuesbelonging representing the affiliation motive and the self-transcendence and conservation valuesself-esteem representing the power motive and the self-enhancement valuesautonomy representing the power motive and the value of self-directionsurvival representing the avoidance motive and the conservation valuesthere is not a complete mapping as not all values are of importance given the type of activities and choices that the agents can make moreover the achievement motive is not included explicitly individual agents inherently are driven to take actions because they need to fulfill their needs longer term kinds of achievement like getting educated or getting rich are not important for the purpose of this contextsome of the needs are subdivided safety has the more concrete needs of food-safety financial-survival risk-avoidance compliance and financial-safety food safety and financial survival represent that individuals have to have enough food and money to survive financial safety means that one has some buffer to pay other than the basic necessities compliance indicates whether complying to norms is important or not risk-avoidance in this context indicates whether people take actions that might get them infected or avoid any of those at all costsgiven this core model of the agent decision model for behavior we can now describe the actual agent architecture as we have implemented it in assoccwe have developed a netlogo simulation consisting of a number between 300 and 2500 of agents that exist in a grid agents can move perceive other agents and decide on their actions based on their individual characteristics and their perception of the environment the environment constrains the physical actions of the agents but can also impose norms and regulations on their behavior eg the agents must follow roads when moving between two places but the environment can also describe rules of engagement such how many agents can occupy a certain location through interaction agents can take over characteristics from the other agents such as becoming infected with the coronavirus or receive information the main components of the simulation areagents representing individuals agents have needs and capabilities but also personal characteristics such as risk aversion or the propensity to follow the law and recommendations from authorities needs include health wealth and belonging capabilities indicate for instance their jobs or family situations agents need a minimum wealth value to survive which they receive by working or subsidies or by living together with a working agent in shops and workplaces agents trade wealth for products and services agents pay tax to a central government that then uses this money for subsidies and the maintenance of public services such as hospitals and schoolsplaces representing homes shops hospitals workplaces schools airports and stations by assigning agents to homes different households can be represented families students rooming together retirement homes three generation households and co-parenting divorced agents the distribution of these households can be set in different combinations to analyse the situation in different cities or countriesglobal functions under this heading we capture the general seir model of the corona virus which is used to give agents the status of infected contagious etc this model also determines the contageousness of places like home transport shops etc based on a factor that represents fixed properties of a place like size time people spend there on average whether it is indoor or outdoor and density how many people are there at the same time under this global functions we also capture economic rules that indicate tax and subsidies from government finally we also include the social networks and groups that exist under this heading the social networks give information about normal behavior and also provide clusters of agents performing activities togetherpolicies describing interventions that can be taken by decision makers for instance social distancing testing or closing of schools and workplaces policies have complex effects for the health wealth and well-being of all agents policies can be extended in many different ways to provide an experimentation environment for decision makersagents can move between places and take the policies into consideration for their reasoning as described in sect 4 agents decisions are based on the container model of needs these needs are satisfied by doing activities and decay over time needs may have different importance to each agent but the overall assumption is that agents will try to satisfy their most important need that is least satisfied at a given moment given the context the context determines which choices are available at any given moment thus eg if agents have to work in a shop they will normally go to work even if the need for safety is high but if they have work that can be done at home as well they have a choice between going to work or staying home to work in that case their need for safety can make them decide to stay homemost needs are composite for instance safety is built up of food-safety financial-survival risk-avoidance and compliance listed here in order of importance ie relevance to the agents direct need to survive eg the safety need is defined as the minimum of the first two and a weighted mean of the rest where the weights are the importances assigned to each subneed here the satisfaction of food-safety is defined as having enough essential resources stocked up at home such as food and medicine measured over a two week period ie the need is fully satisfied if the agent has enough supplies for the coming two weeks and decays from there the only way to increase this need is by going shopping for essential resources however going shopping ie leaving the house may conflict with the need for safety so the agent will need to balance these two needs in its decision to go shopping agents with a high level of risk-avoidance will be more likely to try to avoid the disease and thus want to stay away from large groups of people the need for belonging includes conformity ie the need to comply with norms and regulations which is satisfied by taking actions that conform to the rules such as staying inside during lockdown or going to school or work if that is requested from them conformity can have a negative value in the case that the agent decides to break a rulethe need for autonomy is satisfied when agents are able to follow their own plans agents satisfy their need for autonomy when they are able to make an autonomous decision lockdown policies block many of these actions which means that when an agent reaches a too low level of autonomy it may decide to break lockdown however to regulate this effect and not provide agents with too strong incentives to break the lockdown the compliance is used as a regulating factorthe need for self-esteem is satisfied when the agent believes that its actions are accepted and even followed by other agentsfinally the need for survival represents an agents need to rest if it is sick this need can be satisfied by resting at home if the agent believes it is sick and depletes if it does anything else while it believes to be sick under this need we also fitted the conformity need people will conform to what other people do if they are uncertain about the context and which action is the best to take conforming to others is safe as it is usually good to do what others do thus it contributes to social survivalas can be seen above agents in assocc have a wide range of needs they range over the social health and economic dimensions of society and can therefore also show how interventions intended to remedy eg the spread of the virus can influence other dimensions and due to these dependencies do not have the intended effect in the next section we describe some examples of scenarios we have simulated in assocc to illustrate the use the range of possible scenarios and importance of the approachin fig 6 the results of closing the schools and working at home are shown we show a graph with the health status of the population and the activities taking place when only the schools are closed the left two graphs some people are forced to work at home too as they have to take care of their childrenthe scale on the horizontal axis denotes time four ticks make up one day so the runs cover about 24 months depending on whether any differences still appear after 2 months the vertical axes show the number of agents which is around 330 this number can vary slightly as it depends on the household distribution and the way the households are generated the results are based on 40 runsalthough the number of people at home is of course much higher than people in other places the green line in the bottom plots compared to the baseline simulation which implies less spreading of the virus the peak of infected people is higher around 210 and 215 resp the peak is reached around the same time ie 40 ticks or 10 days the number of people that died is 80 and 78 resp this means that the differences are not significantwe also see a difference in people going to non-essential shops the black line in the activity graphs the number of people at non-essential shops on the right where the last two peaks saturday and sunday show that people go out shopping in the weekendthe above findings show that the measures do not lower the peak as expected but even increase that peak this can be explained by the fact that more people want to leave the house during the weekend as they have worked at home during the week with less social interaction at these public places typically people of different communities are gathered while at work or school more or less the same group of people are present thus closing the schools only increases the spreading of the virus thus without additional restrictions like social distancing and closing restaurants the effect of working at home or closing schools is surpassed by the side effect namely people wanting to go outthe covid-19 pandemic has severe medical and social consequences but it has vast economic consequences as well a recession is expected and predictions show that it can be way more severe than the banking crisis 2009 recession thus governments are trying to minimize the economic impact of the pandemic and try to minimize the financial issues people and companies have by giving massive financial support also once the pandemic has been dealt with restarting the economy is a big challenge as many people have lost their jobs and economic activity has slowed to a minimum with this scenario we demonstrate the relation between the pandemic health measures and the economy this shows the complex and interconnected nature of the situationin many countries the government has locked down the country and closed down business operations this cuts the cycle of income of companies and subsequently either people become unemployed or governments temporarily take over paying the wages of the employees in this scenario we show two different situations the first shows what happens with a lockdown and no government support the second shows the situation when government supports companies by taking over wageswhen government closes all non-essential shops to prevent spread and orders a lockdown the curve of the pandemic is really flattened within the time span of our simulation we see that we are still not experiencing many infections and hardly any deaths note that lockdown here starts when only one person was infected so much earlier than in real life people are almost all working at home the essential shops seem to be doing well this can be seen as hoarding behavior of people that want to make sure they have enough essential products and have still money to buy things they do not buy anything non-essential as those shops are all closed and we have no on-line shopping in our simulation the non-essential shops do not go bankrupt in the simulation because we did assume here that they could postpone all fixed costs like loans rent etc if these fixed costs are taking into account all the non-essential shops will go bankrupt pretty quick without government intervention the velocity of the money flowing through the system decreases due to the lockdown fig 7in the second situation government takes over wages from all people working in the non-essential shops overall we see capital increasing slightly this can be explained due to the fact that people cannot spend money on non-essential products and leisure activities going to cafes sport events etc while the number of unemployednon-payed people is relatively small fig 8the economic activity is kept up by the government however the government reserves are quickly depleting as less tax is coming in and more subsidies are paid this situation is not sustainablein this paper we have shown that in crises like the covid-19 crisis the interventions of government have to be made quick and are often based on too little information and only partial insights of the consequences of these interventions in most cases the health perspective is the leading perspective to inform government decisions however the models used by epidemiologists lack the part on human behavior therefore they have to translate government interventions and the expected reactions from citizens to parameters into parameters of the epidemic model without being able to check for interdependencies we have shown how the assocc platform can be a good addition to current epidemiological and economic models by putting the human behavior model central and from that core connect the health wealth and social perspectivesin general there are several advantages of using an agent based tool like assocc first a tool like assocc explicitly avoids providing detailed predictions but rather supports investigating the consequences in all perspectives from government policies by comparing variations of policies like government subsidizing people or not in the economic scenario it becomes clear what are the consequences and which are the fundamental choices that have to be made taking this stance avoids politicians being able to just blame the model for giving a wrong advice technology should not give single solutions to decision makers but should support the decision makers to have a good insight in the consequences of their decisions and which are the fundamental priorities that have to be weighed eg the joy of life of elderly people against the risks of meeting their family and becoming infected or the risk of contagion happening through schools vs the social disruption when schools are closeddue to the agent based nature it is also possible to explain where results come from eg closing schools might not have any positive effect on the spread of the virus due to all kinds of side effects in the scenario we could see that people were going more to non-essential shops in the weekend because they had to be more at home to take care of the children during the week their need for belonging went up and going to the shops was the only option left as other leisure places were closed tracing this behavior back in this way helps to explain what is the basic cause and where in the chain something can be done if one wants to avoid this behavior each of the steps in these causal chains is based on a solid theory social-psychological economic or epidemiological in our case and thus can be checked both on its plausibility as well as on its theoretical foundationusing the agent based models makes it easier to adjust parameters in the simulation based on differences in demographics and cultural dimensions in different countries but also in different regions or even neighbourhoods in big towns therefore more finegrained analysis can be performed on the impact of government interventions on different parts of the country eg rich and poor neighbourhoods or urban and rural areas can be affected in different ways by the same measurefinally we should stress that we do not claim that agent based models like used in assocc should replace domain specific models actually one could use assocc to simulate intervention scenarios to study the human reactions to it and the consequences having a good insight in these dependencies one can feed the domain specific models with better information to make precize optimizations or predictions for the effect of that intervention thus in this way the strength of the different types of models can be combined rather than seen as competingsupplementary information the full project is available at httpssimassoccorg the netlogo and gui code is available at httpsgithubcomlvanheecovid-sim including a few runnable scenarios described in the websitethe current outbreak covid-19 of the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 in china and the beginning of its subsequent global spread is already impacting global health systems and the global economy 1 how countries and international organizations respond to the challenges it presents may have profound lasting impacts for global health the decisions taken both at national and international levels will help to inform how we react to future pandemics and health security challengesglobal disease outbreaks and pandemics have been increasing exponentially over the last 40 years and experts have long been warning of the potentially devastating effects of a severe pandemic although it is important to note that the improvement in diagnostic capabilities undoubtedly plays a role figure 1 figure 2
 23 by analysing the causes of this and similar pandemics as well as the physiopathological human and political influences on its spread we hope to shed some light on the current health risks decision-making dynamics and future implications of the current coronavirus pandemiccoronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense enveloped rna viruses of the subfamily orthocoronavirinae family coronaviridae order nidovirales among those four are widely distributed human coronaviruses hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 and cause the common cold severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are zoonotic in 20022003 sars-cov caused an outbreak of pneumonia in 8000 affected cases distributed over 30 countries and five continents and is now considered to be eradicated mers-cov was discovered in 2012 4 it originates from bats with dromedary camels as the intermediate host causes pneumonia in humans and has a mortality rate of over 30 nosocomial spread has also been described no specific antiviral treatment is available and treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic 5sars-cov-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus of the coronaviridae family it shares more than 79 homology with sars-cov 6 and causes mild to severe disease with fatal bilateral viral pneumonia described in humans 78 it is referred to as a novel coronavirus because it has not been observed previously in humans its likely reservoir is bats with pangolins identified as the likely intermediate host 9 it is worth mentioning that pangolins are endangered and the most trafficked animal in the world 10 as the pangolin trade is illegal this would explain why they were not listed in the official registers of the wuhan market making it difficult for researchers to identify the source of the virus some researchers are suggesting that the virus may have been circulating previously and the market may have been an amplification setting rather than the source of the spillover 11there are numerous reasons for the exponential growth of global pandemics but the most frequently cited include expansion of the human population destabilization of ecosystems and globalization humans are coming into contact with environments that were previously untouched meaning that they will also come into contact with the viruses and bacteria that are inherent to those environments many of these will have no impact on human health but some do 212human actions that impact animals such as changes in land use and climate change have a profound effect on how these diseases spread as our climate changes certain populations of animals especially mosquitos or other animals that function as disease vectors increase and spread into geographic zones that were previously uninhabitable to them and they are more likely to spread the diseases that they carry to new regions changes in land use and changes in humananimal contact also affect the emergencere-emergence and spread of disease as does the unmanageable explosion of the global wildlife trade legal and illegal wildlife trade is estimated to affect one in four mammal and bird species globally and to generate between us78 and us10 billion annually 1314 in response to covid-19 china placed a temporary ban on wildlife trade on 26th january 2020 15 although this will likely only affect the legal wildlife trade temporarily it is a step in the right directionhow we raise our food is just as important and zoonotic diseases such as avian influenza including the 2006 h5n1 epidemic and swine influenza including the 2009 h1n1 pandemic are often associated with industrial farming the monoculture effect is well known in agriculture but there is mounting evidence that it is also important in animal farming 1617 although the aforementioned studies look at wild animal populations there is a high indication that it holds true for animals raised for food often large populations of specific species of animals raised for food are kept in suboptimal conditions without even mentioning the inherent issues of waste management and animal welfare industrial farming also creates health risks for humans in multiple ways if these populations are not isolated from wild animals of similar species in the case of avian influenza the virus which circulates naturally in wild bird populations came into contact with large homogeneous populations of birds in poultry farms 18due to the disease potential associated with intensive animal farming animals are often treated with vaccines and antibiotics both avian and swine influenza continue to be managed through regular vaccination of livestock 19 although the main reason for antibiotic use in farming is to preserve human and animal health and prevent zoonoses widespread use of antibiotics in terrestrial animal production including first-line antibiotics such as colistin promotes antibiotic resistance 2021 in farming antibiotics are used as prophylactics to make up for crowded unhealthy conditions and growth promoters as well as therapeutic treatments for specific disease outbreaks therefore although they are relevant tools for decreasing zoonoses antibiotic use in animals can also become the catalyst for the development of zoonoses that are resistant to antibiotics 22these issues are compounded by globalization in two main ways interconnectedness and mobility our interconnectedness means that there are huge global markets for specific products from specific environments which can speed up environmental degradation deforestation has already been linked to the emergence and re-emergence of nipah virus lassa fever lyme disease and possibly zika virus 323a current example of this is how the international drive for palm oil a cheap and stable oil in malaysia has led to the upsurge of malaria in the region currently the worlds highest rate of deforestation is of malaysian forests for the creation of palm oil plantations 24 25 26 the zoonotic malaria species plasmodium knowlesi has recently become the principal cause of human malaria in borneo and this has been linked directly to deforestation on the island 2728 considering the dynamics at the humananimalecosystem interface it is not surprising that the worst epidemics and pandemics including human immunodeficiency virus sars-cov avian influenza swine influenza ebola virus and zika virus of the past 40 years were all of zoonotic or vector originhuman populations are also more mobile than they have ever been and air travel enables a pathogen to be transported across the globe in a matter of hours currently over 4 billion trips are taken by air every year and this frequency of travel in an infected and moving global population gives a disease unprecedented opportunity to spread and spread quickly 29 in that sense the timing of covid-19 was very bad luck chinese new year is the biggest mass migration in the world with 385 million people making approximately 3 billion trips during the holiday period 3031 the fact that the outbreak happened during this time makes it that much more difficult to trace and control and certainly influences the speed at which it is spreading in a globalized world the security of countries is interdependent and in the case of a severe global pandemic the world is arguably only as prepared as its weakest country 32the issue that needs to be assessed is the level of risk that more frequent outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging diseases pose for the human population impact can be assessed in different ways including global morbidity mortality economic burden and geopolitical implicationsthe stakes are high the world health organization who estimates that a moderate to severe pandemic would cost approximately us500 billion or 06 of global income 33 as has been shown repeatedly an epidemic does not need to reach severe levels or have many or technically speaking any casualties in order to destabilize national health systems or put a strain on the networks responsible for international and global response and the economyin order to quantify risk and forecast possible scenarios of transmission it is necessary to look at the traits of a specific pathogen there are numerous characteristics that can predict how well a pathogen could spread through and damage a population these traits include virulence clinical severity ease of human-to-human transmission and if the pathogen is transmissible during the disease incubation period if it is the length of the incubation period is of importancehealth system and human factors will also impact the spread of a virus health system capacity factors include the availability of treatment or vaccine and the level of resources human material and financial available for allocation human factors include whether the population is immunologically nave or not how well the human immune system can respond to the virus age structure of a population population density mobility and cultural behavioursindividuals behaviour is informed by cultural beliefs and mores and these can impact movement within a community contact with others and likelihood to comply with official recommendations level of education and previous knowledge of general infection prevention measures also play a role 34systemic factors that will determine the severity of an outbreak or pandemic include the resilience of health systems co-existing external factors that would hinder an appropriate response and the ability of a governing body to respond to the outbreak implement infection control measures in the population and continue to function despite a health emergency health systems are varied a small outbreak of influenza in a high-resource country with a robust health system will likely only have a small impact on the continual habitual or average delivery of health services that have nothing to do with the outbreak a health system that is fragile or already overloaded by either routine care or another emergency needs only a little disruption to damage it or even cause it to collapse traditionally supranational organizations international institutions and non-governmental organizations will fill that response vacuum as well as is possible an example of this and how difficult it is to implement effectively would be the international response to the 2014 ebola epidemic 3536an outbreak in one country can deeply affect not only that countrys economy but also the world economy and the countrys political relationships with other countries eg trade agreements opening or closing national borders etc economists are expecting chinas economic growth to slow to 45 because of the outbreak 37sars-cov-2 fulfils many of the qualities that a pathogen needs to cause a worldwide pandemic it seems to be quite virulent as sars-cov-2 has not been seen before in humans the population is completely nave the virus has also been shown to have high interhuman transmission sufficient data are not yet available for exact figures concerning the spread but there have been initial estimates that each infected person would infect on average 26 other people uncertainty range 1535 38 who estimates are a little less daunting reporting a preliminary reproductive number r
0 estimate of 1425 39 importantly calculations from imperial college london estimate that infection control measures need to block well over 60 of transmissions to be effective in controlling the outbreak 38 that number is most likely inaccurate but this will be easier to assess as time goes on in the case that the virus can be transmitted by an asymptomatic individual 40 it will be even more difficult to implement a 60 effective infection and control ipc strategy especially because most of the people infected will be in the community and not in healthcare settings however the initial report of asymptomatic transmission in germany was inaccurate which is encouraging 41 a further challenge is posed by the decision of foreign governments to evacuate and repatriate their citizens from china the inevitable quarantines and infection control measures that need to be taken as people arrive back in their home countries will be crucial for preventing the spread of the virus 42 the diamond princess cruise ship outbreak of sars-cov-2 in japan with more than 691 infected people and four deaths as of 25th february 2020 is an example of inadequate ipc in the community that led to a disaster 43 44 45the sars-cov-2 genome has already been sequenced and countries are working hard to develop a vaccine 46 47 48 it is difficult to tell what the actual mortality of the virus is as the current death toll includes all-cause mortality of infected people and is likely overestimated by the testing of mostly sicker patients although this information will emerge over time sars-cov-2 seems to be spread mainly by droplets and not through air nosocomial transmission has been described 49 and superspreading events in hospital settings may occur sars-cov-2 is possibly spreading indirectly through contaminated surfaces and hand contamination as well but the lack of aerosol transmission will make the spread less efficient according to who 25 of current cases are considered severe 39 but this proportion would presumably decrease while more patients and contacts would have been searched for and screened the reason for this is that most of the cases screened are for relatively severe infections especially in areas where tests are limited once more people are screened including milder cases the percentage of severe cases and the death rate will inevitable drop and get closer to its true valuecontact tracing of sars-cov-2 suggests that there is a low r
0 and limited person-to-person transmission 50 the exponential spread of the number of cases however may suggest that superspreaders of the virus may be playing a major role either from individuals or a zoonotic source 50 superspreading individuals were found to have a major impact in the previous mers sars and ebola pandemics 34the current death toll is rising much more slowly than the current number of cases 80234 confirmed cases and 2701 deaths as of 25th february 2020 overall fatality rate of 336 51 due to under-reporting a shortage of test kits reporting of all-cause mortality and a prevalence of patients with mild symptoms it is highly likely that the death rate will be much lower than initially expected 5253 there are some estimates that currently only approximately 5 of current cases of the virus have been identified 53 if this is true then covid-19 is far less lethal than it seemsit might be easy for ipc experts to get caught up in the frenzy of getting prepared for a new pandemic granted we do not know what if any long-term effects this virus might have on the human body but what is most important is to keep a healthy perspective and avoid getting distracted by all of the hype and forecasting although sufficient information is not yet available sars-cov-2 may be less deadly than the influenza virus that hospitals deal with on an annual basis and transmission seems to occur mainly through droplets even a high estimate of the r
0 rate is many times lower than for airborne diseases such as measles for instance 54 it is important to remember that the r
0 rate refers to the average transmissibility of the disease and does not give information on how fast it will spread seasonal influenza has an r
0 of approximately 13 but circulates through the whole human population every year 55 human immunodeficiency virus on the other hand spreads far more slowly through the population yet has a highly variable reproductive rate 56 still sars-cov-2 causes pneumonia in healthy people 57 even if most of the deaths are described in elderly comorbid patients more epidemiological data are needed in order to determine the full spectrum of the diseasein order to better understand this dynamic it might make sense to look at sars-cov this has a similar reproductive rate to estimates of the r
0 of sars-cov-2 but only infected approximately 8000 people in the early phase of the 2003 sars-cov outbreak the lack or inappropriateness of ipc measures used proved to be associated with increased risk for cross-transmission and within-hospital spread of the disease among both visitors and healthcare staff 58 59 60 in contrast when applied appropriately ipc measures were extremely effective during the sars epidemic 61 similarly ipc measures will certainly prove to be extremely effective in respect to sars-cov-2 but more detailed transmission models are needed 62 in a 2003 analysis of sars in hong kong that excluded superspreading events the reproductive rate dropped from 29 during the initial phase of the epidemic to 04 after the implementation of ipc measures 63 usually once the reproductive rate falls below 1 the outbreak will die out on its own therefore having a strong and adapted ipc response to this outbreak will be crucial to stopping it an additional factor is that people infected by sars-cov felt unwell and were likely to seek care in hospitals sars-cov-2 seems to cause a wider range of symptoms and if people only show mild infections the infection may go unnoticed with people thinking that they have a common cold this can cause the disease to be underdiagnosed which means that people will be more likely to continue to spread the virusit is essential that we prepare ourselves for what seems like the inevitability of having the virus at our doorstep but we must think ahead to enact commonsense policies that will not cripple the normal functioning of our healthcare institutions that may mean sending people home while waiting for a test result to come back providing home care to mild cases 64 or figuring ahead of time how to handle an extra influx of patientshealthcare institutions can organize beds and isolation rooms and ipc teams can set up hotlines in anticipation of the virus although more easily said than done having a clear definition of what constitutes a suspect case is crucial the case definition will evolve rapidly in a context where the epidemiological risk changes with geographic spread of the disease and possible new information about its epidemiology in order to contain the outbreak the case definition should be broad at an early stage it is also important for ipc teams to work with hospitals in expanding their triage capacity and deciding how to organize the activities during a period with a potentially unusually high influx of patients suspected to have the virus liaising with the virology laboratory to define additional hours and workforce if needed can be an additional step to prepare an institution healthcare staff must be reminded of the importance of hand hygiene standard precautions contact precautions and any complementary measures in preventing the spread of the diseasedeveloping countries face more critical challenges during outbreaks compared with higher-income countries preventing effective management worldwide major issues and challenges of influenza pandemic preparedness in developing countries oshitani 96 the lack of ipc in developing countries with limited resources is a major dilemma that leads to high rates of healthcare-associated infections 65 hand hygiene is arguably the most important infection control procedure and is often neglected by healthcare workers in these countries 66 while developing countries still lack the equipment expertise and health infrastructure to detect and manage patients 65 sars-cov-2 is spreading rapidly in these unprepared countries 67 prompt prioritization of resources precise surveillance and capacity development have been recommended in countries with low preparedness for diagnosing the virus and limiting transmission 68what is most essential is that regular care activities do not suffer because of a pandemic condition and that control of the far more common and far more deadly pathogens that hospitals deal with on a daily basis remains of utmost importancethe scale of chinas response to the pandemic is unprecedented extreme cordon sanitaire-type quarantine measures have questionable efficacy and can jeopardize trust between healthcare providers and the population this was seen in the 2014 ebola epidemic when the government of sierra leone imposed a 3-day quarantine and sent police and military house to house to educate the population and to find people harbouring patients with ebola patients in their homes 6970 that said the covid-19 outbreak is a delicate situation and a difficult decision for the chinese government to make  any decision will have major risks still quarantining a major region will most certainly result in practices that could be considered human rights violations 71it is worth noting that it would be much more difficult for a government to implement such a large-scale dedicated disaster response in a democratic country china worked day and night to construct two hospitals within a matter of days they are made of prefabricated buildings and serve to help handle the overwhelming number of patients 72 on 28th january 2020 after just 48 h of construction china opened another 1000-bed hospital that had been retrofitted into an empty building 73 china has an impressive track record for being able to implement huge engineering projects at record pace during the 2003 sars epidemic they were able to construct a 1000-bed hospital in under 1 week using prefabricated buildings at the height of the epidemic the xiaotangshan hospital treated one-seventh of patients with sars in china 74countries are often motivated to be cautious in declaring an emergency rather than alarmist as this has severe economic repercussions the speculations that china knew about the outbreak before they declared it seem to be well founded on 27th january 2020 the mayor of wuhan zhou xianwang admitted that we havent disclosed information in a timely manner and also did not use effective information to improve our work 75 locally officials might have little motivation to declare an emergency to their superiors 53 quarantines were announced hours before they were put in place which could have encouraged people to flee approximately 5 million residents reportedly left wuhan before the quarantine was in place 75 deciding when to declare a national or international emergency is always a difficult riskbenefit analysis the risks of doing so can disrupt trade and severely hurt a regions economy but policy makers often do not have many options especially when faced with public scrutinyeurope is now faced with the same dilemma after the recent spike of cases in italy but on a far smaller scale the italian government has put a number of towns on lock down and cancelled carnival celebrations to attempt to stem the spread of covid-19 the first example of major spread of the virus in europe also highlights issues concerning the open borders between european countries 76epidemics impact peoples health and livelihoods far beyond the direct effects of the outbreak in the sectors of the countries where the disease occurs 77 during the 2003 sars epidemic the global economy lost an estimated us40 billion 78 the direct economic burden of the 2014 ebola outbreak is estimated to be between us28 billion 79 and us326 billion of lost gross domestic product with the comprehensive economic and social costs factored in the cost to the global economy was estimated at over us51 billion with us18 billion in deaths from non-ebola causes 80 the impact of the outbreak of sars-cov-2 has spread from asia to other parts of the world including europe with the emergence of many sars-cov-2 cases in italy and south korea as two of the worlds major economies concerns have been raised regarding global economic damage 81after some debate who declared sars-cov-2 a public health emergency of international concern pheic on 30th january 2020 the process leading up to this decision is complex and impacts many people on the one hand such a declaration is an international call for alarm but on the other hand it does not guarantee that the outbreak will be ended or the exact nature of the international response 82 who initially declined to label the coronavirus outbreak as a pheic as doing so would be extremely disruptive the member views concerning this decision were quite divided during the first meeting but who agreed to re-assess this decision in a few days time 39 and changed its global risk assessment for sars-cov-2 from moderate to high 83 it maintains that there is no evidence that donors withhold disaster relief funds if a pheic is not declared 84 it is worth noting that who repeatedly declined to label the 2018 ebola outbreak as a pheic showing that there is a tendency to err on the side of caution 85 when it did so in 2019 there was prevailing opinion that the pheic designation would be game changing in terms of resources allocated and international response 86 we predict that the pheic designation for sars-cov-2 will help to mobilize the response on a global scalealthough china has been praised for its rapid sequencing of the virus genome and the impressive construction of health facilities and mobilization of the response it has been struggling with managing the human element 53 effects of outbreak situations such as sars-cov-2 are always difficult to predict because there are so many variables to consider firstly we do not know much about this virus and secondly so much of its spread will be dictated by human behaviour decisions and ultimately luckthere is much that can be done in terms of reducing the likelihood that novel viruses will jump from animals to humans but these measures often include the type of environmental regulation that is difficult to implement in an international system inherently focused on growth and short-term profit there are also cultural and practical issues associated with changing how we farm and stopping the wildlife trade which are equally difficult to implementthe magnitude of effort needed to address this issue is daunting warning systems response networks and real-time tracking are important tools for containing outbreaks but they do not actually prevent them from occurring in the first place projects that catalogue and study novel viruses do not equal preparedness the same scientific work that is used to study a disease can in and of itself create biological risk 8788 both national governments and supranational organizations state that this issue is of utmost importance and have pledged their commitment 89 90 91 nonetheless expert consensus is that there is a high chance of the world dealing with a devastating pandemic in the near future and that we are quite unprepared 8792 93 94still the number of cases in countries other than china continues to grow outside of china there is a growing number of cases and casualties with 12 deaths in iran 10 in south korea seven in italy four on the diamond princess cruise ship two in hong kong and one each in france japan taiwan and the phillippines 45 coupled with the exponential growth of the pandemic the very short pre- or pauci-symptomatic and infectious incubation period of the virus as well as the possible prolonged high-level carriage makes it quite difficult to contain 40 one probable scenario is that sars-cov-2 will just become another human virus that the world deals with on a regular basis who director-general dr tedros warned of a potential global pandemic the window of opportunity is still there but our window of opportunity is narrowing he said on 21st february 2020 we need to act quickly before it closes completely 95 it seems to be less dangerous than initially thought so perhaps once again humanity will be lucky hopefully we can learn from our mistakes before our luck runs outnone declaredthis work is supported by the infection control programme spci university of geneva hospitals and faculty of medicine geneva switzerland hand hygiene research activities at spci are also supported by the swiss national science foundation grant no 32003b163262the sars outbreak has been identified in more than 30 countries in five continents affecting more than 8000 people predominantly in asia especially china with mini-outbreaks in north america and a few cases in europe the disease has led to more than 700 deaths worldwide clusters of cases are particularly common among close associates of patients and the health care workers who treated them and their household contacts because of the alarming global spread of the disease who issued a global alert in march 2003 and instituted worldwide surveillance6
most patients identified up to now were previously healthy adults aged 25 through 70 years10 a few cases of sars have been reported among children  15 years of age in whom the clinical course now is thought to be less aggressive11 we provide a summary of the major clinical characteristics of patients with sars although the information should be considered preliminary because of the broad and non-specific case definitionthe incubation period for sars is widely considered to be two to seven days but occasionally may last up to 10 days symptomatically the illness appears to have two phases an early prodromal febrile phase and a secondary lower-respiratory phase in pathological terms however it is a triphasic disease with a primary viral replicative phase a secondary immune hyperactive phase and a pulmonary destructive phase12 the disease generally begins with a prodrome of typically high fever  38 c that may be accompanied by chills and rigors headache malaise and myalgia also are common at the onset of the illness some patients have mild respiratory symptoms in a few cases the febrile prodrome may be accompanied by diarrhea although rash and neurologic or gastrointestinal findings are absentafter three to seven days the secondary lower-respiratory phase begins with a dry nonproductive cough or dyspnea that may be accompanied by or progress to hypoxemia in up to one-fifth of the cases the respiratory illness is severe enough to require intubation and mechanical ventilationthe fatality rate among patients with illness that meets the current who definition for probable and suspected cases of sars ranges from 3 to 10 percent depending on the age group and possibly other yet unconfirmed factors10 furthermore the mortality rate is higher among those with underlying illnesses and among the very elderlytypically chest radiographs appear normal during the febrile prodrome and in some patients throughout the course of the illness however in the majority of patients the respiratory phase is characterized by early focal infiltrates that progress to more generalized patchy interstitial infiltrates sometimes leading to consolidation in the very late stages13
in general in the early phase of the disease patients may have either a normal or decreased white blood cell count with a reduction in the absolute lymphocyte count at the peak of the lower respiratory phase up to one-half of patients exhibit leukopenia and thrombocytopenia or platelet counts at the low end of the normal range 50000 to 150000 per microliter renal function appears to remain normal in the vast majority of patientsthe box

travel to a foreign or domestic location with documented or suspected recent transmission of sars-covclose contact
with a person with mild-to-moderate or severe respiratory illness and history of travel in the 10 days before onset of symptoms to a foreign or domestic location with documented or suspected recent transmission of sars-cov
likely exposure to sars-covone or more of the following exposures in the 10 days before onset of symptoms
close contact with a person with confirmed sars-cov diseaseclose contact with a person with mild-to-moderate or severe respiratory illness for whom a chain of transmission can be linked to a confirmed case of sars-cov disease in the 10 days before onset of symptoms
laboratory criteriatests to detect sars-cov are being refined and their performance characteristics assessed therefore criteria for laboratory diagnosis of sars-cov are changing the following are general criteria for laboratory confirmation of sars-cov
detection of serum antibody to sars-cov by a test validated by the centers for disease control and prevention or cdc for example enzyme immunoassay orisolation in cell culture of sars-cov from a clinical specimen ordetection of sars-cov rna by a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test validated by cdc and with subsequent confirmation in a reference laboratory for example cdc
case classification
probable case meets the clinical criteria for severe respiratory illness of unknown etiology and epidemiologic criteria for exposure laboratory criteria confirmed or undeterminedsuspect case meets the clinical criteria for moderate respiratory illness of unknown etiology and epidemiologic criteria for exposure laboratory criteria confirmed or undetermined
exclusion criteriaa case may be excluded as a suspect or probable sars case if
an alternative diagnosis can fully explain the illnessthe case has a convalescent-phase serum sample that is obtained  28 days after symptom onset which is negative for antibodies to sars-covthe case was reported on the basis of contact with an index case that was subsequently excluded as a case of sars provided other possible epidemiologic exposure criteria are not present
a number of treatment regimens have been explored for sars these include a variety of antibiotics to presumptively treat known bacterial agents of atypical pneumonia as well as antiviral agents such as oseltamivir and ribavirin steroids also have been administered in combination with these antimicrobial agents however the most beneficial regimen remains to be determined15
until reliable diagnostic tests an effective vaccine and antiviral drugs are available control of the epidemic depends on early identification of suspected and probable cases quarantine of patients and their close contacts and effective infection control measures particularly after patients are admitted to a health care facilityresearchers have confirmed that a new strain of virus belonging to the family coronaviridae is the prime agent of this disease16 17 18 19 although other viruses belonging to paramyxoviruses such as metapneumovirus have been implicated these appear to play only a secondary role if any in the disease process
coronaviridae are a family of rna viruses that have been associated etiologically with respiratory illness in humans and with other diseases in domestic animals interestingly they also are associated to some extent with human diarrheal diseases21 structurally they are 80 to 160 nanometers in diameter positive-stranded and about 30 kilobases in length21 their genome is the largest of all rna viruses and high-frequency recombination between related coronaviruses leads to the generation of much genetic diversitythe virus has three major proteins the nucleocapsid protein is enclosed within the viral envelope with the rna in a helical nucleocapsid the other two proteins are the membrane glycoproteins and the spike glycoprotein21 the spike glycoprotein is responsible for the characteristic fringe of crownlike projections antibodies that elicit spike glycoprotein are thought to confer protection against infection because the human strains are relatively difficult to culture compared with animal strains the extent of strain variation in human coronaviruses is unclear25
there are three serologically and genetically distinct groups of coronaviruses associated with animal and human disease in general they are species-specific although there are a number of examples of viruses crossing species barriers and establishing themselves in new hosts21 25 once the host is infected the virus may produce localized disease that often is restricted to the respiratory epithelium or the gastrointestinal tract or they may produce disseminated infection causing systemic disease21
coronavirus was confirmed as the etiologic agent in sars via serologic techniques demonstrating a rise in antibody titer its growth in tissue culture a determination of reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction or rt-pcr specific for this virus using molecular genetic techniques and animal studies23
animal studies have helped to satisfy kochs postulates which are necessary to prove disease causation19 these postulates stipulate that to be the causal agent a pathogen must meet four conditions it must be found in all cases of the disease it must be isolated from the host and grown in pure culture it must reproduce the original disease when introduced into a susceptible host and it must be found in the experimental host so infected however further studies that include control groups are required to determine the role of other agents if any in causality or as cofactors for severe diseasethe rapid spread of sars worldwide within a few months points to the contagious nature of the disease the infectivity during the incubation period is still unclear and it appears that the risk of transmission during the prodrome is low in contrast in coronaviruses that cause the common cold the viral shedding period usually precedes the onset of clinical symptoms by one to two days although the peak viral excretion occurs during the symptomatic phase21 23 26 the infectivity of sars during convalescence appears to be low and remains to be determinedsome data on the survival and infectivity of the sars coronavirus27 indicate that unlike other coronaviruses it is a rather robust organism that is stable in feces and urine at room temperature for at least one to two days it is more stable up to four days in stool from patients with diarrhea which has a higher ph than does normal stool however the virus loses infectivity five minutes after being exposed to commonly used disinfectants and fixatives including 10 percent formaldehyde 10 percent hypochlorite 75 percent ethanol and 2 percent phenol heat at 56 c kills the sars coronavirus at around 10000 units per 15 minutes considered to be a quick reduction27
the available epidemiologic data suggest strongly that the main routes of virus spread are droplets direct contact and fomite indirect contact transmission although airborne transmission has not been ruled out completely28 researchers believe that the cause of the large outbreaks among health care workers was the transmission of droplets through aerosol-generating medical procedures such as the use of nebulizers28 29
no firm data exist regarding the infectivity of contaminated saliva as opposed to sputum from the respiratory tract through the droplet route in some patients the infection manifests itself as a mild form of diarrhea and coronavirus particles have been recovered from fecal matter hence it is possible that fecal contamination could lead to the spread of the disease although more data are needed to confirm this route of transmission it is interesting that some animal coronaviruses are spread through the fecal-oral route21
from about 20 days after the onset of clinical signs elisa tests can be used to detect immunoglobulin or ig m and iga antibodies in the serum samples of patients with sars early antibodies are detected in some patients within two weekssars virusinfected vero cells can be used to detect igm antibodies in serum samples of patients after about day 10 of the onset of the disease this test is reliable yet demanding because the live virus must be grown in cell culture in addition subsequent immunofluorescence needs to be demonstratedlaboratory workers can detect virus in specimens for example respiratory secretions blood from patients with sars by infecting cultured vero-e6 or fetal rhesus kidney 4 or frhk-4 cellslaboratory workers can use pcr assays that detect genetic material of corona-virus in patient specimens such as respiratory secretions blood or stool samples primers that are required for this test now are available widely through various web sites for example the cdc the university of hong kong and the governmental viral unit of hong kongclinicians must exercise caution when interpreting laboratory test results because the key to diagnosis is clinical evaluation and possible exposure to an infected person a positive laboratory test result indicates that the patient is or has been infected with the sars-cov while a negative test result does not necessarily rule out sars16 23
seroconversion of paired serum samples with convalescent serum samples obtained more than 21 days after onset of symptoms is a reliable sensitive and specific diagnostic method however the current diagnostic option of choice for early and rapid diagnosis is rt-pcr detection of virus in respiratory or fecal specimens this test has low sensitivity and a negative test result does not exclude the diagnosismany laboratories are addressing the problem of sensitivity and specificity of the sars diagnostic tests and it will take some time before a highly sensitive specific quick and simple diagnostic test is available it is possible that as is the case with hiv infection saliva could be used as a diagnostic fluid in this contextas health care providers dentists should be able to identify a suspected case of sars the cdcs current interim diagnostic criteria for sars are shown in the box14 they are subject to change as more is learned about the disease and should be reviewed periodically by visiting the ada or cdc web sitesas stated above we doubt that patients with sars who are in the acute febrile phase of the disease will visit a dentist in the unlikely event that this does occur the dentist should not treat the patient in the dental office but should refer him or her to a health care facility as soon as possible for diagnosis and care dentists also have a duty to report the case to state or local health departments32
as always dentists should take a thorough medical history from each patient and update it at each recall appointment5 the questionnaire used for this purpose may have to be modified to incorporate targeted screening questions regarding sars although these questions may appear superfluous during the current abeyance of the outbreak they are important as a guide if there is another outbreak of sars or an outbreak of a similar new disease these questions may include the following
do you have feverhave you experienced a recent onset of a respiratory problem such as a cough or difficulty breathinghave you within the last 10 days that is the incubation period for sars traveled internationally or visited an area where documented or suspected community transmission of sars is occurringhave you come into contact with a patient with sars in the past 10 days
in the event that the patient recently has returned from a geographic region with documented or suspected community transmission of sars the clinician can defer elective treatment until the incubation period is over dentists can provide emergency treatment provided they use routine barrier precautions and avoid spatter or aerosol-generating procedures this emergency treatment should be limited to the control of pain and infection dentists should not treat patients in the dental office who are suspected of having sarsif a patient replies yes to the first two screening questions the dentist should wear a surgical mask discuss his or her potential concerns with the patient call an area medical facility such as a hospital and inform the staff that he or she is referring a patient suspected of having sars so that arrangements can be made for transportation and care of the patient patients with sars need ground emergency medical services32
these screening questions should be asked routinely of all patients because questioning only a select group of patients for whatever reason may undermine the early detection of infection and might be construed as a discriminatory practice clinicians should delay treating convalescing patients for at least one month after they are released from the hospital convalescing patients are instructed to remain at home for seven days after discharge from the hospital and during this period they are requested to stay indoors and keep contact with others to a minimum33
a preprocedural antimicrobial mouthrinse with 012 to 02 percent chlorhexidine gluconate is believed to reduce the number of microbes that are released into the operatory environment this has been shown in a number of studies in which a long-lasting mouthrinse for example chlorhexidine gluconate with povidone iodine and essential oils has reduced the disseminated microbial load during procedures such as ultrasonic scaling34 35 however no concrete data show that a preprocedural mouthrinse reduces infection among dental health care workers or patients a preprocedural rinse would be most useful in situations in which a rubber dam cannot be used such as when a prophylaxis cup or an ultrasonic scaler is used and in the absence of assisted high-volume suctionmicroflora on the skin can be divided into two categories the transient flora colonizing the superficial layers of the skin and mainly acquired through environmental routes and the residential flora thriving on the deeper layers of the skin and hair follicles36 the exogenous superficial flora are harmful and pathogenic but are removed easily with clinical hand-washing procedures by contrast the endogenous residential flora are almost impossible to remove completely but are less likely to be associated with infections36
the single most important method of preventing transmission of any infectious agent including the sars coronavirus is hand washing and appropriate hand care studies have found that even in critical care units hand-washing compliance is relatively low sometimes approaching 40 percent37 by contrast a dramatic reduction in the prevalence of health careassociated infections has been shown when regimented hand hygiene measures were introduced38 thus appropriate hand hygiene is the mainstay of a good dental infection control programfurthermore recent data indicate that the sars virus compared with other coronaviruses is a relatively robust organism and may survive on nonporous surfaces for up to 48 hours39 this reinforces the need for good hand hygiene as well as the importance of thorough surface disinfectionfor routine dentistry which entails examinations and nonsurgical procedures plain soap and water are adequate recently the cdc recommended that if the health care workers hands are not visibly soiled an alcohol-based hand rub could be used for routine decontamination because this is as effective as hand washing and also saves time40 also clinicians should decontaminate their hands both before and after removing gloves because humidity and moisture cause bacteria to multiply rapidly under the glove surfacehand rubs that are based on alcohol alone should not be used owing to their rapid evaporation and lack of residual effect consequently hand rubs must be laced with agents such as chlorhexidine octenidine or triclosan to achieve the needed effect41 after using an alcohol-based hand rub the clinician must dry his or her hands thoroughly before putting on gloves because any residual alcohol may increase the risk of glove perforation42
face masks were first worn by surgeons to minimize postsurgical infection in patients due to microbes that were exhaled or shed by the surgical team43 however the realization that face masks protect the health care worker as well as the patient has led to the routine use of this protective measure in many clinical settings including dentistrytransmission of airborne infection depends on factors such as the virulence of the organism as well as the number of organisms transmitted44 in the case of coronavirus-induced pneumonia leading to sars airborne droplet transmission of infection is considered to be the main route of spread45
various types of masks and face shields are available surgical masks usually provide adequate protection in dental care settings where highly transmissible infectious diseases are not typically encounteredhowever surgical masks are not designed to provide adequate protection against exposure to airborne infectious agents such as tubercle bacilli or droplet nuclei smaller than 5 micrometers for such purposes particulate respirators for example n-95 masks must be used during the sars outbreak in hong kong the vast majority of dental practitioners in that country used n95 masks for routine dentistry however these masks are uncomfortable to wear for extended periods because of the difficulty in breathing through a thick impervious fabric and are not recommended for routine dental office settingsrubber dams help minimize the production of saliva- and blood- contaminated aerosol or spatter samaranayake and colleagues46 reported an up-to-70-percent reduction in airborne particles around a 3-foot diameter of the operational field when a rubber dam was used a split-dam technique may be used in situations in which gingival areas are involved such as class v restorations and crown-and-bridge preparationsaerosol-generating procedures should be avoided as much as possible if rubber dam isolation is not feasible some of these procedures include ultrasonic scaling root-surface debridement and high- or low-speed drilling with water spraythere is no doubt that coronavirus research has gained an unprecedented and urgent momentum owing to the lethality of sars and its nearly worldwide spread within a few months consequently laboratories throughout the world are working in unison to provide answers to many unresolved questions as well as to develop a new preventive vaccine in dentistry in particular a number of questions remain to be resolved including the following
does the virus survive in human saliva and if so for how longis the virus shed in saliva during the early incubation period or during the convalescent phase of the diseasedo human salivary constituents such as lysozyme lactoferrin and the salivary leukocyte protease inhibitor have anticoronavirus activitycould the virus spread in a dental clinic environment because of aerosols and if so are additional barrier protection measures required to prevent such spreadwhat are the more efficacious disinfectants that kill or inhibit the viral activityhow long does the virus survive on surfaces and what factors such as humidity affect its survival
although the global threat of sars has peaked for the most part it is helpful to review the response of the community to this novel disease it is fortunate that sars was not sufficiently infective to cause a repeat of the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed millions even so we might be able to attribute the relatively low death rate in large part to the worldwide surveillance networks and patient isolation efforts that were introduced rapidly in most countries in retrospect an overreaction seems to have been a better option than allowing the disease to run out of control as was the case with the aids pandemicthe who lifted all its travel advisories47 as of june 15 2003 and since then only three new cases of sars have been reported two of theseone in singapore and the other in taiwanwere accidental laboratory-acquired infections in research technicians working with the organism while the third patientfrom guangdong province in southern chinais thought to have acquired the infection through contact with contaminated rodentsbecause the initial symptoms of sars mimic those of many variants of atypical pneumonia a high degree of suspicion by the medical establishment intense surveillance and immediate quarantine of all close contacts of patients should ward off another large-scale winter outbreak if sars does return its epidemiology may be different from that of the current strain for instance the genome of the new sars-cov may differ and the virus may be more or less infective than the original strain that emerged in 2003 furthermore we do not know how long the acquired immunity to sars persists also will those exposed to the virus be carriers of the disease in the face of a new infection how many will be silent healthy carriers of the virus will an emergent strain or strains behave similarly to the older counterpart we do not have the answers to these questionsthe reason for the pandemic spread of hiv is its ability to mutate rapidly from one generation to another so it can escape the immune surveillance mechanisms of the host as well as the prescribed antiviral medications the sars virus on the other hand seems to be remarkably invariant the genome sequence of isolates from patients in singapore toronto china and hong kong has not revealed any changes of major consequence23 this does not mean that the sars virus is incapable of mutation rather because the virus has encountered little resistance from new human hosts there is less selective pressure for new mutants to emerge and persistmany researchers are working on potential drugs and vaccines to treat patients with sars however their approach has been scattered for the most part as they screen the multitude of available drugs and compounds for their ability to destroy the sars-cov thus far a few have had success one group reported that the compound glycrrhizin which is derived from licorice roots can rid cultured monkey kidney cells of the sars virus48 other researchers using in silico research have proposed that the newly described proteinase of the sars virus which converts viral proteins into the active form required for viral replication49 could be inhibited by drugsanimal models are essential for experimentation and drug discovery thus far the only validated model has been cynomolgus macaque macaca fascicularis20 a smaller and less expensive animal model for sars research has yet to be definedalthough vaccines exist for animal coronavirus infections it may take a few years before a vaccine for sars is developed it is comforting to note that the existing technology and know-how for animal coronavirus vaccines could be translated directly toward the manufacture of a sars vaccine furthermore implicit evidence shows that the vaccine approach to preventing sars is feasible because patients conditions appear to improve when they are given hyperimmune serum from recovered patients with sarssars vaccines could be based on a killed sars virus or on an attenuated virus that is sufficiently potent to replicate itself in humans and initiate a successful antibody response but not potent enough to cause disease another option would be to re-engineer a harmless candidate virus to contain genetic sequences of the sars virus this approach has been used to produce a prototypic vaccine against a coronavirus that causes bronchitis in chickens50 should there be a renewed threat of sars a vaccine would be a most-welcomed weapon by health care workerssars is the first readily transmissible infectious disease that the global community has confronted in the new millennium this surely will not be the last contagion that we will encounter the fact that no dental health care worker or dental patient has thus far contracted sars in a dental setting is a testament to good infection control measures that have been implemented in the vast majority of dental offices however the dental community cannot let down its guard and must be constantly aware of impending infectious threats in various guises as well as recrudescence of disease that may challenge the current infection control regimenup until very recently worldwide higher

but separated physically in an internationalized university deal with disruption brought about by the covid-19 pandemicat first news spread slowly with some reports saying that the virus could not be spread by human-to-human contact however as was later found it became clear that local government officials had failed to properly assess and report the extent of the outbreak tufecki 2020 when word finally did spread to all corners of the nation it was too late thousands upon thousands of citizens would become infected with the worlds largest annual migration helping to cement covid-19 as a certified global pandemic this annual migration known as the spring festival in china is a time when families ceremoniously go back to their hometowns for often-times the only visits they will pay their relatives during the year ironically for many this visit which usually lasts no more than one to 2 weeks has now been prolonged indefinitely as millions of families anxiously wait confined to their homes praying for news of a cure or for that matter any signs of abatement the virus continues to spread across the globe each new day brings news of yet another country hit by the seemingly incurable and devastatingly elusive covid-19 virus referred to colloquially as the coronavirusit has been about a month and a half now since my january 17th trip to beidaihe a trip that was supposed to be as with many others a 2-week trip to visit family before heading back to beijing to prepare for the spring semester however on around january 21st news started circulating about just how dangerous this virus was with daily updates on the incredibly infectious nature of covid-19 quickly turning a regional concern into a full-scale national emergency not witnessed since the sars outbreak of 2004 around this time the government began to lock down not just wuhan the epicenter of the epidemic but every city prohibiting inter-province travel and confining netizens to their homes with bands of local volunteers reminiscent of the red guard militias of the past ensuring that stringent new curfews are adhered to by all it was almost surreal as images of americans being evacuated from wuhan swept across social media on january 29th many foreign nationals followed suit catching last-minute flights out of the country sometimes having to transfer multiple times to avoid travel bans enacted for passengers flying out of china some stayed however choosing for one reason or another to wait it out placing outsized trust in our adopted homeland hoping against hope that chinas exceptional measures of containment could stem the rising tide of infection for those of us not hailing from centralized nation-states we cannot help but marvel at how efficiently china has managed the quarantine of its almost 14 billion citizens hoping that our own countries can find their paths towards containing the spread to our families and loved ones overseas so we continued to wait sometimes patiently sometimes in desperation frequently with a malaise that comes only hard-earned from having not left your apartment for weeks on end from the feeling of never knowing when this interminably cruel holiday might endwithin a few weeks those of us within chinas field of he ie students lecturers etc were met with messages from our respective university faculties we were informed that regardless of the continued national health emergency without so much as a gap in scheduling classes would continue as planned the one caveat all classes would now be held online i wondered aloud and not so politely at how this would be possible how could an entire nation take classes online this was a government decision which touched every single level of education from compulsory education at grade one all the way up to phd level graduate courses everything would now be held in one form of virtual classroom or another my skepticism would need to be held in check as of now during the time of this writing chinas millions of students are studying online to varying degrees of success no doubt but studying online nonetheless and i an avowedly anti-online education professional someone who more than once decried the need for a physical classroom as a medium for scholarly debate and socialization find myself not just taking an online course but teaching two as well so i am now confronted with the task of undoing all of my prejudices and biases against the digital pedagogical revolution hoping praying that i can evolve quickly enough and with enough acumen to provide my students with an educational experience that overcomes the obstacles present within an education system grappling against a semi-apocalyptic viral pandemicwith the spread of the covid-19 controlled and the number of people recovered incrementally rising wuhan the epicenter of the pandemic is walking out of the lockdown from january 23rd i cannot forget the moment when i saw the news about the lockdown i was shocked because i traveled to wuhan last summer with my boyfriend i shared the story with him at once and he said it is bad later on as the news reached more people around the world different interpretations and voices came up one voice by the influential newspaper the guardian eve 2020 was that the lockdown was a massive authoritarian measure eroding human rights back in the day i guess they could not see the ironycovid-19 soon spread all over the world and many countries have announced similar lockdown orders for instance italy which has an exceptionally large number of casualties announced a nationwide lockdown on march 9th why could not they see that covid-19 does not know borders and that any place attacked by the disease that did not respond quickly and effectively would bear significant sufferingchinese overseas feel the direct impact of this politically fueled hatred these days some of my chinese friends who are studying abroad get unwelcome treatments wearing a mask as self-protection brings them loads of hatred and fear one of my friends in the uk was pointed at directly by a stranger who shouted coronavirus this lady got the mask on some of my friends believe this hatred and fear are due to cultural differences while others view these are related to racist nationalism or xenophobia international students who are very vulnerable to these attitudes and behaviors need more than ever to remain calm and rational fortunately following the global spread of the pandemic more and more people realize the necessity of wearing masks and know that covid-19 is not a chinese virus i do hope that will block the resentment stirred by those biased groups that fueled hatred among people from different countriesbetween january 18th and mid-february the first thing i woke up to every day was wechat news and notifications of new cases in my area the only topic discussed during that period was the coronavirus starting from january 26th all residents in my community were not allowed to go out without exceptional circumstances the community had only one open entry and one open exit and also a 24-h epidemic monitoring duty to go in and out one had to wear a mask i expected that the whole society would be paralyzed under the pandemic with no stores open no cars or people in the street but i underestimated the efficiency of the governments measures and peoples determination to overcome difficulties i can know the world without leaving home in addition to tv reports and announcements of my schools online public account news opinions and academic articles about the coronavirus are flooding social media platforms such as weibo and wechati take classes have zoom meetings with my supervisor in germany every tuesday and discuss with my classmates from all corners of the world i have also taken up courses through beijing foreign studies universitys website whose online language learning platform is open to the public and free of charge since february 1st its foreign language courses cover 20 languages including online courses and resources supporting foreign language teaching and learning international exams and culture general education etc those courses prepare people to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected and intercultural world and to support the goal of international education to help students adapt to and address global challengesi expected that going online would be a tough challenge for teachers and students of kindergarten elementary and secondary schools who are not so keen on high-tech teaching facilities and may be conservative in regard to online education but i changed my view when i saw nuo my nephew who was in her second grade of junior high school having online classes every day five-year-old yan another nephew of mine has been taking drama classes online with a british teacher both nuo and yan have school assignments and projects about coronavirus i am amazed by their teachers high levels of information literacy and adaptability to online teaching peoples acceptance of online education is getting increasingly high and the speed of popularization of online education may exceed our imaginationmy elder sister who is a mother of three children has immersed herself in the joy of cooking and baking following her online cuisine lessons now we do not have only traditional chinese cuisine such as dumplings and yuan xiao but we also enjoy western food such as toasts chiffon cake sushi pizza pasta and so on online education extends the reach of traditional educators not only to students studying at schools but also to other groups such as homemakers online education can also provide more courses that might not be offered by ordinary chinese schools such as baking and drama learners regardless of their nationality or social status are now confined to their homes online learning is accessible to them without discrimination in unfortunate lockdown circumstances caused by covid-19 pandemic online learning and teaching are useful tools to boost international educationin mid-february it became clear to us all this winter break will not end soon covid-19 made us all seriously prepare for online teaching and learning feelings are mixed and everyone is on their toes it is hard to focus on work when everything is up in the air i find myself eager to return to my normal life and learn properly but as a regular joe renting an apartment in beijing there are many things i need to do before i return to my old regular life i need to pay attention to city instructions whether my community allows travel how to keep myself safe on the way how to self-quarantine how to get essentials during self-quarantine where to buy face masks is there a ration for this or that product and which online store is still making deliveries i need to apply to my university not only for returning to campus but also for returning to beijing things could never be as simple as they used to befor university staff the workload for preparing online education is astounding and the shift is not easy being an urban university beijing normal university is notorious for a high population density and we cannot afford community transmission yet we already have confirmed cases of covid-19 suddenly everyone is alert self-isolating and looking frantically into online teaching and learning but not everyone knows how to do it well facultys tpack technological pedagogical content knowledge is challenged most directly but there are lots of heartwarming moments like when faculty and staff are sharing all their resources and knowledge on group chat fixing each others technical hiccups showing both theoretical backgrounds and applied experiences trying out innovative measures for their cohort and expanding their understandingas a student of online learning i thought that i came prepared i pride myself to be a semi-veteran of online teaching because i used to work as an online teaching instructor developed tutorials and packages to help faculty teach online am familiar with many online learning management systems and teleconference tools on the market and i did research in online teaching pedagogy how hard can it be for me but i could not be more wrong as it turned out i could never be too prepared when our cohort meets online i can see the struggle for instance i struggle to find a convenient platform for sustained and threaded conversations for now we have a notice board but that is of little meaning for going back and forth on our learning i fear this will be the case for this entire class without structured study and work-life structure i am consistently close to missing deadlines trying to balance work and researchwe staff working on university internationalization are heartbroken with the pandemic international students are leaving one by one we are tracking down and checking up our faculty members and students in foreign countries making sure they are safe planned international travel gets canceled until may we write to our partners and cancel events and bookings however i believe that these are only temporary emergency measures and that our international ties will not weakenit all started in december 2019 at the end of the first semester every international student had hisher plan during vacation some wanted to visit different places and others planned to go back to their home countries unfortunately the covid-19 outbreak caused tension fear panic and dilemmas to international students many of their plans missed the mark especially for those who remained in chinabeijing normal university was brought to a halt international student affairs kept in touch with love and support to international students emphasized and admonished the need to stay indoors avoid crowds and gatherings some campus gates closed to ensure security international students who were away from campus received notices which prohibited them from returning until further notice on-campus international students faced a challenge whether to go back to their countries we had no idea when novel coronavirus threat might come to an end things continued to worsen we were told to stay indoors and shops were closedwe had only one open supermarket which hardly had all the products we needed most of the restaurants closed as well the one open restaurant offered food which was not to everyones tasteswe now follow online classes some international students especially those who are in their home countries face network problems and time difference is a challenge we are praying that this crisis will come to an end soon medical doctors and the chinese government are looking for a solution day and night as parents lose their children children lose their parents as well it is so painful and we are crestfallenthe novel coronavirus epidemic quickly accelerated and spread through china killing more than 4000 people the epidemic has pushed chinas health system beyond its capacity bringing the country into intense additional stress and ultimately forcing school closures public gatherings were banned including lectures and various restrictions have been imposed on students freedom of movement entertainment and socialization the university temporarily isolated suspected cases and that caused additional stress one international student described her experience of stigmatization that she experienced after the quarantine fellow students in her dormitory were afraid of the virus and they would not touch her and even talk to her she felt hurt and responded by isolating herself from her friends this incident reveals vulnerability in the school communities capacity to recognize the specific stresses and losses of those quarantinedschool closure fueled fear and mistrust and school reopening is delayed by the ministry of education at the height of the epidemic important resources had to be diverted from education to health emergency response programs a robust emergency plan has been developed by all universities and colleges online and distance learning programs are strongly encouraged students have noted various emotional impacts of the outbreak many report a profound feeling of loneliness due to the ban on public gatherings some of my friends expect a rise of depression and anxiety disorders in post-novel-coronavirus china however the university does provide a social service support system to help students through the closure of the university the chinese government the ministry of health and the international community are working together to figure out how to combat such an outbreak we pray and hope that the novel coronavirus epidemic will be over soonat the end of january novel coronavirus cases were detected in wuhan city and many other areas teachers and instructors tried their best to ensure the safety and health of every student here are some of the requirementsinternational students who live on campus or off campus or travel in other cities of china during the winter vacation have to report their location and their temperature to their counselor every day if students have been to wuhan recently or in close contact with students who have been to wuhan they need to inform their counselor students who live on campus must pay attention to the hygiene and ventilation of their rooms they were asked to stay in their room do not leave the campus if they need to go out of the dormitory be sure to wear a mask and take their student card and go to the dormitory reception registration students who live off campus have to stay at home and try not to meet with people especially to avoid social gatherings students who live on or off campus should reduce the frequency of going out for shopping teachers suggest that some representatives help other students to go to the supermarket to minimize the risk wash hands frequently wear masks outdoors disinfect timely exercise and a proper diet will help students enhance their immunity and stay healthy if there are any suspected symptoms such as a cough or a fever go to the hospital and get medical treatment immediately and then report to their counselor during the period of epidemic prevention and control chinese teachers and administrators help international students in daily disinfection to ensure the safety and health of every studentunfortunately the discrimination against chinese people around the world spread with novel coronavirus international students from china are also involved when chinese teachers do their utmost to look after international students from all over the world chinese students are discriminated against and excluded due to a narrow limiting and parochial view i wish the world could unite together and fight against the novel coronavirus with some real actionthere were many reasons for me to choose to undertake a phd in china one of the main ones was being able to finish the imposing process in 3 years while in my home country of the usa a phd generally takes a few more years what i have learned since coming to china is that if one wants to finish that journey in 3 years a strict timeframe must be adhered the first year is predominately about taking courses and being a student the second year should be marked by two distinct milestonespreparing a proposal and successfully defending it happening hopefully in the first semester and the beginning of the research phase where the identity of the student switches to that of the researcher second semesterfor those like me a second year phd student in china an unexpected hurdle was thrown into the mix of our carefully scheduled timeframe covid-19 became the latest virus to rear its ugly head against humanity i like many others had plane tickets to go back home and there i would wait for news in the upcoming semester as the spring semester drew ever closer i waited in anticipation for when i could go back to china yet here it is march and i am still in the usa unable to return until my university says i canyet the university continues with online classes daily check-ins on temperature and emails from the university but what is ignored is the disruption caused the impact of the coronavirus can be quantified by the loss of profits for universities but how to quantify in terms of students loss and their ability to do researchas i am a human being i am inherently selfish and keep returning to the thought of my own research which is now on hiatus thus making me a researcher-on-hiatus a far cry from what i should be if i am to finish in 3 years my whole proposal centered around china and the unique position of international schools in china instead of traveling throughout china with my supervisor to understand the international school experience i am sitting at home thinking of this pause as a friend pointed out even if i tried to do this online the students answers would be reflexive of their own recent experiences with covid-19 creating a whole new dynamic to the researchhow does one cope with research in the time of covid-19 which has caused many like myself to take an unwanted hiatus and has presented an unprecedented barrier for many phd students covid-19 is the epitome of uncertainty offering an opportunity for novel research experiences and insights giving fresh perspectives in which to address research like my own the dichotomy of research in the time of covid-19 is ever present as it continues to be a time of massive disruption but also potential and flexibility a time when phd students in china must learn how to be researchers in the time of covid-19during my first semester course i submitted a write-up for one of my classes and i was determined to improve on the write-up and upgrade it to an article and then submit to a journal for possible publication during the winter vacation however my plans changed with the covid-19 outbreak in china when the disease started i thought it was just like any type of flu outbreak but as the month of january progressed the situation became serious and death toll started to increase news reports on the number of affected cases and the death rate got me panicked and worried covid-19 was labeled a dangerous disease without a cure at the time scientists were not even sure about its mode of transmission numbers of infected cases kept swelling every day and the death toll skyrocketed i was left wondering why me others who came before me studied successfully and returned home with no stigma but i was caught in the middle of the outbreak to make matters worse the university imposed a lockdown on students living on campus and prevented us from even visiting our country-mates in other dormitories on the same campus this move drowned my hope and academic energy and replaced them with fear and stressthis resulted in self-quarantine in my 3  3 meter room spending days and nights on my phones talking to relatives and getting comforting words from them sometimes just to spend time i aimlessly watched movies without even knowing their titles as days went by my worries and anxiety got worse i was engulfed by fear and the wish to return home grew stronger my academic enthusiasm i once had was washed away and replaced with uncertainties and fear of losing the academic year as well as my life the worst moment was when my roommate packed her bags and returned to her country at a period when the number of cases across china was around 4000 per day i lost hope and was unable to open my computer for days i could barely eat not to mention doing any academic work to make matters worse two people were diagnosed with the flu on campus this sent a wave of panic among international students and i was particularly hit by this news i spent days without leaving my room or talking to anybody in my dormitory my plans of writing the article faded away even the idea of doing a background check on education policies in my country to identify a possible research gap that i could use to design my research topic was put on hold while the virus was ravaging wuhan the epicenter it was equally damaging my academic stamina and determinationduring peak period of the disease beijing normal university was like a ghost city one day i came out of my room to get some fresh air and decided to walk around for a while the whole campus was quiet and empty and the only thing i could see and hear were my own footsteps when i returned to my room i was devastated and i expected to lose my scholarship and be sent homeinability to engage in any tangible academic activity during the winter break has interrupted my academic calendar i failed to submit a possible thesis title to my supervisor so i was behind schedule i was equally unable to write my proposed article or do any advance reading on possible coursework for the second semester i was unable to concentrate knowing that the virus was dangerous and had no cure i was worried about being unable to fulfill my academic dreams based on rumors spreading about the infection rate among students adoption of online classes by the university has relieved my worries and fears for being delayeddue to this severe outbreak on january 27th an official statement has been released from the beijing normal university and the government has had new regulations put in place regarding teaching and learning this outbreak obliged everyone to stay at home and put stress on teachers to find out new learning tools i would say it pushes us to a new learning era e-learning keeps people students and teachers on pace with their studies works and their research it also supports parents in homeschooling opportunities taking advantage of stress relief and spending more time with the family for me e-learning is an opportunity to develop more skills from and out of my institutesecond year phd students like me who are supposed to start their data collection are stuck in a haze of uncertainty my research is centered around chinese teacher education i had planned to take a role along with my supervisor in class observation and group interviews timeframe for this semester was planned in detail taking into consideration additional actions in case of inability to implement original plans however the outbreak of covid-19 put me in a state of questioning other researchers might find it possible to conduct their research through alternative options such as online interviews however those of us who need to go through observation and interaction with participants like myself need to wait for the end of the pandemic my research is designed around a certain case study that takes place only once each year it cannot be brought online because teachers and students need to be observed and interviewed during and after practical courses after receiving news about school closures and class delays i can only postpone my research to an uncertain time in the future my plans to complete this phd journey in 3 years will be extended by this postponementthe impact of this outbreak did affect not only our research plans or academic life but also our mental strengths for some who are not used to isolation like myself the rise of cases in and out of china and social distancing created in us a fear of the unknown in the near future and made us in an endless blue full of uncertaintiesuncertain of the near future situation away from family and friends has an influence on the daily functioning and learning process i would say for a period found myself unable to concentrate or progress any further but as the semester starts online classes brought back a glance of life again and interaction the blue that i was once in slowly faded away and back to normal though this pandemic is taking way longer the chinese government ministry of health and the international health organizations are working together to figure out how to combat this outbreak and we can only pray and hope that this epidemic will be over soonchinas collective memory in 2020 began with anxiety restriction and isolation when did you begin to fully understand covid-19 a student from northwest china stated as followsi was not concerned about the virus outbreak when the news came online when i heard about the wuhans lockdown on january 23 and the governments introduction of the relevant policies my attitude changed i was also heartbroken when i saw the picture of mr nanshan zhong sleeping on his way to wuhan to prevent the spread of the infectious disease when i focused my attention on the daily rise of the confirmed cases i felt scaredwalter lippmann said that in our information age people are unable to feel every related emotion personally they can only rely heavily on the reproduction of social reality by mass media wang 2019 in the covid-19 outbreak negative events repeated and peoples emotions were contagious with the shutdown the spread has continued a large number of people were infected and the lack of rescue materials exacerbated the disaster and also heightened the overwhelming effect of press mediaafter emergent public health events accurate collection monitoring and publication of data are particularly important to the publics rational judgment primary health knowledge possessed by individuals did not reduce the impact of the epidemic yet it expanded the national sentiment under the spread of public discourse insufficient understanding and speculation have caused public panic which has continued to bring about irrational behaviors such as fear rumors looting materials violence and conflict this may be due to the lack of perceptions about public health educationformation of social groups concerned about general interests in the public sphere forms a critical public opinion habermas 1999 in cyberspace since the medias symbolic treatment of news as well as unchecked irrational cognition of groups stories named chinese virus wuhan virus pandamonium yellow peril etc have undoubtedly challenged international students during the spread of covid-19 students interviewed from russia uk israel italy and germany said they had been involved in verbal and physical conflict to various extents ccyl 2020rapid emergence of public health education has affected international education mobility and cognition following mers sars ebola zika covid-19 and other epidemics people should realize that viruses co-exist with nature with proper health education the public needs to take steps under the correct guidance now is the time to popularize international public health education all over the world this is not the time for non-systematic separation and differentiated treatment all countries may need to integrate public health issues into basic education from the perspective of consciousness and actionrisk and survival go hand in hand in human history early humans lived short and brutal lives as the search for food and shelter exposed them to physical dangers from preying animals poor weather war and outbreak of different diseases risk clearly is inevitable but what does it mean to manage riskin december 2019 an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infections was detected in wuhan china in the beginning morbidity of covid-19 has been low but it soon reached a tipping point in mid-january 2020 during the second half of january a remarkable increase of infected patients in affected cities occurred outside hubei province because of an increase in traveling before lunar chinese new year followed by an exponential growth the outbreak spread to other countries attracting extensive attention around the world evidence of clusters of infected family members and medical workers confirmed human-to-human transmission by droplets contact and fomites so far there is no definite evidence for intrauterine infection according to current estimates covid-19 has a median incubation period of 3 days range 0 to 24 days with potential asymptomatic transmissionon february 18 2020 about 380 cases were reported in beijing where i live some university students were infected causing fear among students and staff residing in and out of campus many overseas chinese students traveled home during the festive period and were unable to return to their schools chinese students studying in new zealand for example were unable to return to school due to customs regulationsinternational education significantly improved through effective risk management which controlling or management mechanisms theories or models could best manage potential risks of the covid-19 while maintaining safety and continuity of education internationally perhaps china could offer answers to some of these questionsthe government response to major public health emergencies always arrives with a slight temporal lag in the field of education this lag is even more prominent i first heard about the new coronavirus at a seminar in late december 2019 where one of my classmates from hubei told us that a new virus is quietly invading wuhan but people who released the news were punished for rumor charges later it was proven that china missed the best time to control the new coronavirus at that time my classmate worried that history will repeat itself like in the 2004 sars epidemic and that we will not come back to school in the next semester her words came trueat 1000 january 23 2020 the whole chinese nation entered a quarantine and national and international education governance began to play a vital role in mitigating the crisischinas international education governance manifests in two main aspects incoming students including foreign student management and outcoming students including overseas student management through a combination of official documents such as policy documents notices news etc and my personal feelings and experiences i distill following characteristics of chinas international education governance modeleducational governance philosophy china regards the epidemic as a systematic battle and the progress of international education governance is a must-win as president xi jinping noted resolutely wins the war of prevention and control of the epidemic situation strikes and wins the war in the education systemgoals and objectives ensure the heath of students maintain normal functioning of international education and improve quality of educationsubject ministry of education plays a vital role during this period new government institutions like the office of the leading group of the ministry of education the chinese service center for scholarly exchange and chinese scholarship council play an essential role in international education governance during the epidemicobject china is a centralized state with a top-down policy working model so international education will impact provinces schools teachers students faculty members and universitieslinks international education governance covers primary secondary and higher education including enrollment education employment and further education china also values civic education in this processmethod chinas international education is governed mainly through issuing documents notification and notices news and so onsince january 2020 coronavirus has caused a major public crisis every chinese person is affected in china and abroad since lockdown local people regard outsiders as potential virus carriers especially people living in wuhan and even hubei many of whom have been blown out of their accommodation and spent the spring festival in their parked cars until the government installed them for isolationit is astonishing to watch discrimination against chinese people just because the virus originated in china thus covid-19 intensifies divisions within human beings it seems to be a part of human nature to defend those who belong to ones own faction and attack those who do not why cannot we just acknowledge differences with reason as the old proverb says there are no two identical leaves in the world when we face a person we should eliminate symbols imposed on them by social norms so that we can see his or her soulprejudices exposed by the epidemic are common in interpersonal communication especially among people from different countries even in the field of education they choose to use the imaginary national image to define the face of the peer rather than to understand others and in return foster a broader understanding of a nation in international education students should be encouraged to express themselves truthfully a students personal opinion should be based on his or her experiences not on propaganda listening and then judging is a responsible way to overcome the conflict brought by the unknown just like asking the diaspora can ease the anxiety of keeping distanceunlike traditional spring festivals which are always full of joy this years holiday was full of loneliness and anxiety because of the sudden outbreak of covid-19 as a graduating student i returned home during vacations and my supervisor said we would end a time-critical project soon after the spring festival but this is now delayed and my planned summer international exchange project has become unrealistic however that does not mean i am at a complete rest because curriculum arrangements from establishing contact groups to using online teaching platforms are now in place this may indicate that the epidemic will not end in a short timemany young people on social media said that they played the role of educators in their relationship with their parents by persuading them to draw attention to the virus and take protective measures in my family this role is not obvious my mom who worked to fight sars 17 years ago is very alert to the news she carefully recalled her trips from past few days and strictly disinfected the familyshe even stopped the family from eating together tv shows have become our entertainment but my mother soon did not want to watch them because rates of infection and death were constantly updated in the lower third of the screen which made her very nervous i played some psychological games to remove the focus from the epidemic and kept reminding her that staying at home is a very effective measure of protection in contrast to most children persuading parents to draw attention to the virus i have assumed a stress-relieving role in my familyas an emerging internet market china was not caught off-guard by online education almost all courses including swimming lessons have been transferred online yet many courses use different platforms and i have heard that many of my classmates want to return to school as soon as possible because the efficiency of learning from home is quite low many also said that it is nearly impossible to focus at home and that there is nothing better than face-to-face academic activitieswhat is a truthful way to tell a story why and how does the story of student experiences of the covid-19 pandemic matter in humanitys collective quest for appropriate emergency measures and long-term solutions since november 2019 public health organizations including world health organization and the media have made huge efforts to deal with the outbreak yet people living in china especially wuhan province are nevertheless severely affected lockdown school closures business closures trade closures almost everything is stopped or significantly slowed down the chinese government has made many strategic innovations and policies in tackling the pandemic for schools and universities that means transferring teaching and learning onlinein this autoethnographic article 15 graduate students at beijing normal university have shared their views experiences and feelings about challenges and opportunities for chinas international higher education in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic the article offers reflections on covid-19 and chinese international education experiences of online teaching and learning reflections on universitys coping mechanisms an account of realities and feelings related to changes in academic life and discussion on coping strategies in chinese international higher education contributors write about their individual feelings effects benefits challenges and risk management strategies as they experienced them in the pandemic the article portrays links between students academic and personal goals government measures such as self-isolation travel bans and quarantine realities of staying at home and their relationships with various factors from cultural settings to class and strong personal feelings caused by the pandemicthe covid-19 pandemic has brought a huge social experiment into our homes streets cities countries and globally outcomes of this social experiment will follow the whole humankind probably fairly unequally far into the future jandri 2020 while this article can hardly answer many questions posited by the pandemic which still rages at the time of writing the presented testimoniesbrutal honest and written in the heat of the momentwill surely contribute to deeper discussions awaiting the whole world after the end of the crisischinas internationalized higher education during covid-19 collective student autoethnography provides an important service to readers giving a snapshot of the tumultuous and dynamic experiences of individuals involved in international higher education in china during the covid-19 pandemic while initial experiences with covid-19 took place in china people around the world have been now impacted as the pandemic has reached global proportions based in hong kong and originally from the usa i have often compared my experiences of being impacted by covid-19 with those of family and colleagues in western countries while many people face the same basic predicaments no matter where they are at the same time differing conditions and personal particularities of identity and perspective make a difference this article thus effectively highlights both unique experiences and shared ones with covid-19 in china at the same time revealing fascinating paradoxes of the struggle to cope with covid-19 in the context of international higher educationunique identities are displayed effectively in the article which does not seek a convergence of views across diverse authors of the writing but instead enables each to communicate in their own voice from their own experience some key positions here are those of the student and the educator in international higher education as well as the place of those identifying as chinese and as international in that context while students and educators face different challenges authors also reveal here different emotional responses to the new normal i particularly enjoyed reflecting reading of the emotions and attitudes felt by different authors about going online some express pride about fast thinking in china in relation to the pandemic and moving education en masse online others reveal early disdain for online education followed by surprise at its possibility for learning and connecting with others yet others share about having prior confidence with online learning but shifting into uncertainty in novel conditions the view of doctoral students is also moving as this group faces quite complex challenges in terms of managing scholarly commitments and everyday lifethe context of international higher education in this piece reveals more complexity it shows how covid-19 as a global phenomenon positions us as international persons in a new way now to be chinese feels like a curse to some as a few authors observe the xenophobia pointed at chinese people abroad today as covid-19 is associated with china yet at the same time there is space for new pride in chinese identity as well as the response to covid-19 there has been swift and effective although this also raises questions about the value of personal liberty from an international view being in hong kong i resonated with such reflections as hong kong faces a similar challenge as it is accused by western people of coping with covid-19 in an obedient way which is increasingly being recognized as an effective wayas a collective piece this article shows that the global is experienced as particular and as emotionally complex and dynamic by each of us as individuals as we enter the next phases of this world event this work can serve as a valuable foundation for later reflection on the role of international higher education around the world in relation to covid-19 i thank the authors for their courage and honesty in grappling with their places in this historical momentautoethnographic accounts are honest reflexive and often emotional discussions of personal human experience as researcher narratives they sit in stark contrast to prejudiced opinions which are preconceived notions neither based on scientific reasoning nor even on actual experience in these moving testimonials from international research students and staff in china during the covid-19 pandemic outbreak we hear warm individual tales of personal struggles at the point when life and work changed beyond all recognitionwhile coming to terms with suspended personal research plans unnatural social isolation and loneliness anxiety and threat of bereavement these authors describe too confronting their own prejudices towards online teaching and learning for the sake of their students and themselves they discuss searching for a convenient platform feeling pushed into a new e-learning era losing hope being unable to open a computer and finding their former academic enthusiasm simply ebbing away others comment on the joy of online connection including cooking lessons that extend the realms of digital learning these adjustments represent just some of the many complex postdigital challenges thrown up by this global pandemiceach individual story reveals a powerful diverse postdigital positionality where who we are is constructed in a deeply personal cultural political economic technological and material context hayes forthcoming 2020 researchers are trained to account for their positionality as they undertake qualitative inquiry however not only are the identities of authors revealed here their covid-19 narratives are shaped also by the decisions of their governments their university technologies they communicate through and multiple media accounts of what others are experiencing in virtual and physical spaces simultaneously such is the postdigital condition jandri et al 2018 where a messy hybrid intertwining of the physical biological economical and historical meets the technological cultural and personalthis is illustrated through a different form of prejudice than simply an aversion to online education human prejudice in a postdigital era has multiple routes for post-truth expression students discuss stigmatization by others after quarantine where irrational fears fueled by social media replace kindness this is human bias cultivated at the intersections of biology technology and our material world where digital devices meet superstition and where physical masks chosen for health protection become also destructive weapons of hatred and racismas scientific research currently holds the gaze of the world in anticipation of a vaccine antibody testing kits and personal protective equipment autoethnographies of human experience may not seem of practical urgency yet these describe how individuals actually contribute to flattening the curve they reveal the human adhesive that binds our global medical effort across communities through education and social care that reaches beyond personal fears these new researchers in international higher education in china have bravely shared their diverse poignant postdigital positionalities as such each contributes to an emerging picture of global research that will ultimately take us forward from this crisis this is research that recognizes that science education and human experience are completely inseparable in our postdigital era and that our international covid-19 effort requires interdisciplinary collaboration across them allright before the 2020 chinese spring festival the outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid-19 takes place in china fear of sars which caused large scale of panic in 2003 appears to come back along with the fast spread of the infection in the wuhan city other neighboring cities within hubei province where wuhan is the capital city as well as many other cities outside hubei province across the whole country fig 1as early as late december 2019 the novel coronavirus has been laboratory-confirmed in china wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 later as person-to-person transmission of covid-19 is also confirmed public concern of the spread of the novel coronavirus increases dramatically chan et al 2020 it has even caused global health concern as well wang et al 2020 on january 27 2020 world health organization who remains its assessment of risk of the event as very high in china and high level elsewhere1
however on january 30 2020 who raises its assessment to a public health emergency of international concern2
it is really a bad time for the event since the spectacular spring transportation in china brings hundreds of millions of people back home for the chinese lunar new year liu 2014 as the spring transportation is considered to be the largest scale of temporary human migration on earth this tremendous large number of travelers makes it extremely difficult to contain the spread of the infection within the epicenter of outbreak ie wuhan city as announced by the local government in the news express on january 26 2020 5 million plus people out of 14 million have left wuhan before the city is officially sealed off3
tremendous efforts have been employed to contain the infection and cure the infected patients and china has taken various measures to combat the novel coronavirus4
although the clinical features of patients infected with covid-19 is relatively mild compared with sars huang et al 2020 its spread is faster as of april 30 2020 the accumulated total number of confirmed patients of the novel coronavirus is 84385 in china and the number of death cases is 4643while we observe the evolution of the covid-19 epidemic in china we notice substantial heterogeneity in the size of the epidemic of cities across the country hence this study tries to answer some essential questions to the transmission of covid-19 raised by the reality with the evidences from china first why do some cities have more infected cases while some other cities have less second what is the role of the distances of these cities with confirmed cases to the epicenter of the outbreak of an infectious disease with large scale third what are the lessons of the transmission from the urban characteristics of those cities fourth is there a quantitative model which can predict the actual infection scale of the epicenter precisely with the information of the epidemic in other citiesin the above questions we keep mentioning cities in fact people need to pay more attention to the social and especially urban fundamentals of the transmission of covid-19 not just the biological features of the virus itself indeed the virus is transmitted among persons in the background of the cities in this particular perspective the currently ongoing epidemic of covid-19 can be treated as an urban incident as well which causes substantial challenges to the urban management or even urban planning therefore how to deal with the current epidemic using urban regulatory methods and how to prevent it from ever happening in the future are what we need to learn and discuss from the urban perspective at presentthis study does not discuss how the outbreak happens instead it focuses on the aftermath of the outbreak and the spread of the infection among cities especially this study provides insights of the fundamentals to the infection from the urban perspective where the marginal effects of some most influential factors to the covid-19 transmission are estimated this study shows empirical evidence from real world data and it can provide hints to future scientific research on the novel coronavirusin addition this study provides an alternative way to know the actual size of a large-scale outbreak in the epicenter among the four questions mentioned earlier the last one can be notoriously difficult due to the technical difficulty and high cost for the laboratory-confirmation of covid-19 we are unable to know the exact scale of the infection at the epicenter of the outbreak in its early or even middle stage especially in the initial stage of the epidemic in the epicenter there can be substantial undocumented infection numbers li et al 2020a therefore precise estimation of the real infection scale is badly needed this is the lesson we really need to take from the experience in wuhan china similar understanding of the scale of the epidemic needs to be done in other emerging regions with epidemic before it is too late to contain the epidemic situation these correct estimates of the size of the epidemic are also crucial to prepare and allocate appropriate medical resources to save livesthe succeeding part of this paper is structed as follows after reviewing the related literature we discuss the data and statistical models the empirical results are then shown with the focus on the marginal effects of the key variables in the discussion section later we compare the estimation results in difference time spots to show the evolution of the covid-19 epidemic in china and then we provide our estimates of the infection numbers in the epicenter of china ie wuhan city with high precision at last we present out concluding remarksearlier related studies are more commonly seen in regard to the spread of flu or flu-like diseases such as the outbreak of ebola in west africa kucharski  edmunds 2014 valencia et al 2017 after the outbreak of covid-19 the scientific scholars remain active and pay close attention to this emerging epidemic the evolution of the novel coronavirus can be very complicated xu et al 2020 and there are more and more studies on this virus to come out by the end of january 2020 some other studies on covid-19 are already released some popular topics commonly seen are listed here but not limited to the following studies such as the use of data heymann 2020 early transmission dynamics li et al 2020b epidemic in other countries outside china holshue et al 2020 the impact assessment munster et al 2020 the forecasting of the spread wu et al 2020 the genomic characterization lu et al 2020 and the clinical characteristics chen et al 2020the most famous epidemic model in mathematical bioscience is credited to the seir model some earlier studies of which are highly cited li et al 1999 li  muldowney 1995 however after the outbreak of covid-19 some estimation results using seir model are far from the reported numbers shown later read et al 2020 tang et al 2020 perhaps one big reason for the failure of such biological models is that they ignore the fundamentals of the urban perspective which in fact provides the real background for the virus transmission indeed the high population density in the metropolitan area as well as the massive level of public transportation in the large cities can play sort of multiplier effect for the virus transmission therefore ignoring the urban context in the discussion of the transmission of a severe infectious disease is the mistake we cannot takewhile the researchers in the biological science community are keen to estimate and predict the size of the emerging epidemic of an infectious disease outbreak scholars in the economics and especially urban study communities keep a much lower profile this time we have to admit that not too much related studies can be found in the economics and urban professions however now even the biological and medical scholars realize that both challenges and opportunities regarding the current epidemic can be resolved in urban settings lee et al 2020 as noted besides the economic consequences cities especially the large cities are the most populated area in a region which are typically travel hubs and employment centers therefore cities are the natural existing soil to the large-scale outbreak of the fast transmitting communicable diseasesalthough the discussion of human health issues in the urban context is popular orimoloye et al 2019 wang 2020 the particular studies on the urban infectious disease are rare among the limited studies of this strand typical examples are the discussions on the price change in the neighboring property ambrus et al 2020 and the household-built environment characteristics spencer et al 2020 in addition the effect of social network isolation on reducing the transmission of flu infection is also discussed aiello et al 2016 however to our knowledge studies on the transmission of an infectious disease under the urban setting are barely seen once there was the study on a virtual outbreak of a flu epidemic in heavily populated metropolitan area with the simulation of its spread lee et al 2008 unfortunately it comes true worldwide this timein fact the use of statistical methods in epidemiology is quite popular and necessary and many advanced techniques in statistics such as the bayesian analysis have been employed elderd et al 2013 in addition mathematical models are also commonly used in the studies of virus spreading dong et al 2015 therefore in the technical sense there should be no barriers for the economists and urban scholars to cross the border of such different disciplinesas discussed earlier lee et al 2008 many factors of biologic and physiologic as well as social economic and geographic can place influences on the transmission and spread of the infectious disease such as flu therefore to achieve such research goal the methods to be used must be built-in interdisciplinary etard et al 2017 unlike those studies from purely scientific perspectives such as cells genes etc this study presents a multidisciplinary analysis of all the cities in mainland china with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus covid-19 we will try to reveal the hidden rules of the transmission of covid-19 behind the real-world data with proper models and statistical methodsthis study uses a joint data set combining with several different sourcesthe data of the infection number is obtained from dingxiang yuan5
the data used in this paper is obtained at 0908 am beijing time march 2 2020 as well as some earlier time spots such as january 31 2020 and february 5 2020 in this data source we only use the number of confirmed patients for a more focused research purpose technically speaking these confirmed numbers are laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases which is not the same as those suspected cases that can be potential covid-19 cases but not yet laboratory-confirmedas for the distances from the target cities to the epicenter of infection outbreak ie wuhan city we measure the distances in the digital map provided by baiducom in addition the temperature data is obtained from the website of weather china6
at last the local urban attributes data for the target cities are primarily obtained from the china city statistical yearbook 20187
which was released on january 24 2019 the latest yearbook has not been released by the time when we conduct this research although the year book 2018 in fact includes data of 2017 luckily the numerical values of urban area urban population and others do not vary too much which makes this data set still valid for this studyhowever the inclusion of sample cities becomes a technical trouble since the reported number of laboratory-confirmed patients can be lagged and not accurate especially at the early stage of the outbreak when a large number of potential patients in the epicenter rush into hospitals the local hospitals are lack of test kits to confirm whether they are patients of the novel coronavirus or not in a short period of time which is the main reason for the lagged report of confirmed numbers in addition some patients with mild symptoms may be cured before they are timely confirmed of covid-19 this is the case in wuhan city in its earlier stage of the epidemic and it is also the case in the emerging epicenters elsewhere such as those cities in europe and the ustherefore in this paper we try three groups of estimation using the full sample the subsample without wuhan city the subsample without hubei province where wuhan is the capital city respectively according to the reasons shown above the subsample without hubei province is expected to have the best performance for the most accuracy of its reported number the epidemic size of covid-19 in the cities of mainland china without wuhan city is illustrated in fig 1
 in addition the descriptive statistics of all the dependent and independent variables are shown in table 1
here we show a simple log linear regression model which considers the number of laboratory-confirmed patients as dependent variable and uses many other explanatory variables to find the influential factors the regression equation is shown below1lny01lndist2xwhere y is the number of laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases dist is the distance to wuhan city which is the key control variable the relationship of distance to the number of the confirmed patients of the novel coronavirus is shown in fig 2a and b in addition x is a vector of explanatory variables which are chosen as total length of built urban metro lines urban area population density annual quantity of wastewater discharged residential garbage connected and transported per capita public recreational green space in this paper at last  is the stochastic error termalthough the above regression model appears to be simple the real hard part is that since there are so many possible factors that may affect the spread of virus there can always be missing explanatory variables left in the error term the result of which can lead serious endogeneity problem especially for the extremely complicated issue like this ie the outbreak and spread of the mysterious covid-19 many potential influential factors are technically yet unknown to us thus we are unable to include them as the independent variables as a result the regression parameters with endogeneity issue are inconsistent which makes the estimation not valid in our study which explanatory variable is the endogenous variable we cast our doubt on population density since logically it is closely linked to a possible virus transmission in the local areathe common way to solve the endogeneity issue is to find appropriate instrumental variables ie ivs and use 2sls liml or gmm to redo the regression however the tricky part here is that the instrumental variable is not easy to find according to its definition it must be uncorrelated with the error term and correlated with the designated endogenous variable which is included in all the explanatory variables our question is therefore that does such instrumental variable exist in real worldluckily after numerous rounds of tests we finally find that temperature is a perfect candidate in fact it is the reality in china that the population density tends to be larger in the warmer places ie the southern part of china of course we do rigorous statistical tests to verify whether the use of temperature as the instrumental variable is appropriate which is shown later in this paper in addition since there are a highest temperature and a lowest temperature in the daily records after tests for many times we choose the highest temperature as the instrumental variablehere we show the marginal effects of some most influential factors to the transmission of the novel coronavirus covid-19 which are estimated from the urban perspective by analyzing the data from all the cities in mainland china with laboratory-confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus here we propose the following important findings which are based on model 6 in table 2
 as noted we set the time spot of february 5 2020 as our baseline models which corresponds to table 2 and we also compare the results before ie january 31 2020 for table 4 and after march 2 2020 for table 5 in later section of this paperdistance to wuhan is found to be a very strong influential factor cities which are 1 closer to wuhan city increase the confirmed infection number by 0962 the p value is almost 0 which shows that distance really matters in statistical level as we know that 5 million plus people have left wuhan city before the city is officially sealed off although it is really difficult to track where exactly these people go the distance to wuhan city is a very good proxy variable to represent this massive level of human movement logically the closer to wuhan city the easier for the people from wuhan to travel to those locations this fact is in very good consistent with our finding in this papertotal length of built urban metro lines does matter to affect the virus infection every increase of 1 km of lines increases the confirmed infection number by 0002 although this quantity appears tiny it is statistically significant it is easy to understand that as the primary tool of massive transportation in modern cities the metro carries a very large number of passengers including the potential patients therefore the spread of the virus within the city can be accelerated and extended by the metro systemcities with urban area 1 smaller increase the confirmed infection number by 2571 in addition cities with population density 1 smaller increase the confirmed infection number by 2603 the above two findings show very clearly about in which direction that we shall pay more attention to contain the virus spread at the first glance these findings are counter-intuitive since the common sense that we are familiar with suggests that the larger cities with denser population are more easily to spread the virus infection which is generally correct however we must consider the very special background of the virus spread in chinafirst it is in the particular period of time in china ie the spring festival and spring transportation the spring transportation is normally 40 days long including the 7-day national holiday of spring festival many people working in the large cities rush back to their hometowns which are typically middle or small cities or even rural areas for family reunion for this reason during this period of time many large cities are much less populated as they are in normal period of time second since the outbreak of covid-19 in wuhan city many residents of wuhan and some other large cities take evasive activity to leave the large cities especially wuhan to small cities or even rural areas as the result of the above two reasons in this special time period the transmission risk of the novel coronavirus in small cities or even rural areas may be larger than those in the big cities our statistical result shown in this paper in fact confirms this propositionin addition cities with annual quantity of wastewater discharged 1 larger increase the confirmed infection number by 1397 the p value is around 1 which is very significant in statistic sense as well also cities with residential garbage connected and transported 1 larger increase the confirmed infection number by 1633 as we can see the p value is around 2 which is a very strong signal for its influence on the infection the above two findings are statistically strong enough to provide new clues for possible direction of the investigation on the spread of covid-19 although the coronavirus type of disease is typically considered to be the infection via air-borne droplets the real mechanism of the spread of covid-19 is yet unknown before the mysterious chain of spread is completely understood the statistical findings found in this paper can give hints to scientists and policy makers to take precautionary activities the most importantly appropriate steps must be implemented before it is too late to contain the spread of the virusis the spread of covid-19 associated with water especially discharged wastewater is there middle host of the virus in the water does the residential garbage which may also include wastewater have something to do with the virus spread and infection we are not absolutely certain about the answers to these questions at the present moment however the statistical findings shown in this paper can still contribute to the clues for future study and related regulation policies for example as many chinese residents wear face masks after the outbreak of covid-19 it is easy to predict that the used masks in the residential garbage can reach a massive level if the residents just randomly junk their used masks without proper attention it may cause secondary spread of the virus therefore our statistical results make sense and show the right directionat last we use the per capita public recreational green space as well as a dummy variable for capital city in the province as additional explanatory variables as we can see the smaller such green space area is the higher the confirmed infection number is however it is not statistically significant in model 6 it is barely significant in model 4 this result though not directly indicates that cities with larger open space may be less vulnerable to the virus infection it can be considered to be a general result not just to the spread of covid-19 the capital city dummy variable is not significant in any modelas noted earlier we use three groups of samples ie the full sample the subsample without wuhan city the subsample without hubei province where wuhan is the capital city presented in table 2 we see that the estimation is robust in the sense that all the estimation parameters of corresponding variables have the same signs in all the models however which one is our best shotto answer this question we examine two things first a glance of table 2 shows that the most key variables are statistically significant in model 6 which is a very desirable result second both the endogeneity test and weak instrument diagnostics show that model 6 works the best in model 6 difference in j-stats is very significant and cragg-donald f-stat is very close to 10 which make model 6 pass the required statistical tests for endogeneity and the validity of the instrumental variable the technical favor of model 6 also makes sense to us since wuhan city is the outbreak epicenter of covid-19 in china the confirmed cases in wuhan is much larger than anywhere else therefore the inclusion of wuhan to the data set for transmission analysis can be biasedin addition with the help of model 6 we are able to purify the data set by deleting those observations with poor prediction performance the most of which are remote cities with very small number of confirmed covid-19 cases and thus can be considered to be observations with extreme values after deleting these cities from our data set how good would the result be hence we present table 3
in table 3 the ols results in model 7 and 9 are very good since all the explanatory variables except capitalcity are very statistically significant at nearly 0 level and the adjusted r
2 values are increased to above 73 level however the 2sls results in model 8 and 10 are not good any more after the data purification by model 6 the endogeneity issue can be reduced to a very large extent hence the ols results are already goodin fact to understand the covid-19 epidemic in china we must first understand the role of the spring festival as well as the spring transportation in china essentially this is in the everybody-rush-home manner after the national holiday of the spring festival the peak time of the returning travelers in the spring transportation would come it is the real challenge to contain the epidemic situation since travelers from so many small cities or rural areas return to the big cities where they have their jobs which may cause a second round of outbreak in the large cities as this paper shows small cities during the period of spring festival suffer from more rapid transmission of covid-19 in fact in the days of early february the rapid increasing number of infections in shenzhen one of the most economically advanced cities in china and who has the highest ratio of migrants has already signaled a warningtherefore appropriate precautionary steps must be taken immediately to prevent the second round of outbreak in the big cities from ever happening in table 4
 we show the estimation results in model 11 to 16 as a comparison the data used in table 4 is obtained on january 31 2020 the time of which is at the end of the national vacation of spring festival as we can see very clearly results of urban area and population density are less significant in table 2 which means that the transmission of covid-19 increases in big cities after the spring festival holiday as we know strong regulatory intervention policies have been employed timely one of which is to postpone the back-to-work dates in fact the massive level of returning side of the spring transportation does not occur as those regular yearsluckily the containment of the covid-19 epidemic in china is a great success that the epidemic outside hubei province is almost stable since late february in table 5
 we show the estimation results using data obtained on march 2 2020 as a comparison as we can see the urban area and population density is no longer significant though they still remain the negative signs again after the purification of data the ols model works fine since the number of sample cities is only around 200 we present the linear gaussian model lgm estimated by markov chain monte carlo mcmc with gibbs sampling to check the robustness of the models as shown in model 19 and model 22 even after 20000000 mcmc draws the parameters and their significances are almost the same as the corresponding ols models in addition the frequency illustration of some key variables in model 19 is also shown in fig 3
the last question in this paper arises for model 7 and 9 as well as model 17 and 20 which one has the best prediction power now we look at wuhan city again which is the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak in chinasince the model prediction result of the number of covid-19 infection cases in wuhan city relies heavily on the distance to wuhan we must discuss the radius we use here before we can proceed since wuhan is a big city we cannot just simply consider it to be a point with a radius approaching to zero it is really hard to depict the radius of activities that the most people do in the city as reported by didi the leading sharing car company in china 90 residents in a city stay in a particular radius from the center of the city8
for wuhan such radius is measured as 25300 km which covers a large proportion of the metropolitan area in wuhan we present fig 4
to show the validity of this radius in fig 4 we demonstrate the satellite image of wuhan city with the 253 km radius which is then compared to the map of the official comprehensive planning of wuhan 20102020 as we can see the 253 km radius is clearly in consistent with the official comprehensive planning for the metropolitan area of wuhan moreover it covers the majority of the built urban area in wuhan very well as the satellite image confirmsin table 6
 we show three levels of such radius the first one is the 25300 km mentioned above the second is 17890 km which stands for exactly half of the area of circle shown by the first radius the third one is the half of this radius which is 12650 km as noted the second radius feels more like the most representative center of mass of wuhan city then how can we evaluate the prediction results shown in table 6 since the reported number of confirmed covid-19 cases in wuhan corresponding to the prediction results of model 7 and 9 in table 6 is 8351 the mean value of the prediction results of model 7 tends to underestimate the real epidemic size of covid-19 in wuhan this is due to the lack of information from the surrounding cities in hubei province where wuhan is the capital city which limits the prediction ability of model 7 on the contrary model 9 has the valuable information from those cities in hubei province and hence can predict betterwhen we update our prediction using data of march 2 2020 the results are much closer to the reality as shown in the last column of table 6 the prediction with the radius used for wuhan city as 17890 km shows the outcome of 56944866 as the mean value of the prediction please note that the model prediction result is in the self-updated manner that is when we update the estimation parameters with the latest data the prediction result will be updated as well however since the local epidemic situation of covid-19 is almost stabilized in early march 2020 the latest updated numbers of the epidemic in china is in fact reflecting the imported cases from abroad which is not appropriate for our research purpose therefore we stop updating the epidemic data for this study in early march 2020 as of april 30 2020 the number of confirmed covid-19 cases is 50333 in wuhan considering that there are possibly omitted infected cases self-cured cases before confirmation and other possible reasons our estimation is very accurate in fact as of april 14 2020 the accumulated cases of asymptomatic infection in mainland china is 6764 where 588 cases are imported from abroad therefore adding these symptom-free cases to the reported confirmed cases mentioned earlier our result is more accurate than we expect9
as a very multidisciplinary research paper this study may provide valuable information to a variety of readershipto biological and medical scholars this study may provide hints to the possible ways of transmission of covid-19 since many biologic and physiologic features of this new disease are still unknown the statistical findings shown in this paper may present valuable clues for example we do not know for sure that how the wastewater and residential garbage may affect the transmission of covid-19 but since the statistical results are significant scientists can look into these fields perhaps they may have unexpected breakthroughto researchers of mathematical bioscience this paper gives an alternative way other than the seir models to estimate and predict the actual size of a large-scale outbreak of epidemic in the epicenter the method shown here is born to be practical since it is based on only a few information from regions outside the epicenter of the outbreak the data of which is more accurate and reliable at the initial or even middle stage of the epidemic as shown in the paper the estimated number of infections in the epicenter of china ie wuhan city is 56944866 mean value which is very close to the officially reported number this result is obtained through rigorous statistical tests and examinations and such method and its result are proven to be accurate given the example of wuhan as shown in this studyto policy makers knowing the accurate size of epidemic or how bad it would evolve to as early as possible in the initial stage of the outbreak is very crucial to get prepared and allocate scarce medical resources the result of which is hence that more lives can be saved in addition the empirical results shown in this paper have important policy implications as well for example if the distance to the epicenter is found to have so much influence on the epidemic spread then the government should seal off the city as epicenter immediately without hesitation furthermore if the subway is shown to be very statistically significant in the transmission one should close the subway system promptly we understand that these are all difficult decisions to make in the urban management however since it may take a very long time for the scientific research to reveal the hidden mechanism of the virus spread we cannot wait for months or even years before the infection numbers go exponential therefore if we can observe some influential factors with statistical significance at the initial stage of the outbreak we should act quickly to cut off the transmission chain by any possible methods we havein addition this study also provides insights to urban planners for example this paper has discussed the role of public green space in the epidemic although the corresponding coefficient shown in the paper is not quite significant its negative sign indicates that proper urban planning with more available open space can be essential to the fight with various disasters and catastrophes as for the epidemic of covid-19 two major temporary hospitals with 3000 beds are built promptly in wuhan citys open space to treat patients with severe symptoms many more temporary hospitals are also prepared in the city for the proper medical treatment of patients with mild symptoms or for quarantine use later when the situation gets much better in china in late march and early april 2020 people restore their recreational activities in open green spaces but the gathering activities in the indoor recreational facilities are still restricted the above two scenarios are all good examples of the important uses and roles that the green open space in the cities can playas the epidemic situation is still going on and evolving quickly around the globe this study provides a timely analysis of the spread of the infection among cities in mainland china now the epidemic in china tends to be stable but the situations in many other countries are still getting worse the methodology and main conclusions shown in this paper are of general interest and they can be applied to other countries to help understand the local transmission of covid-19 as well as concerns exist that the worse situation is yet to come the findings and implications of this research may offer methods of preventions to minimize the damage of the disaster from the urban perspective in the other word this study may provide valuable and timely hints and clues to the local fight with the terrible diseasethe above implications also apply to the economists and urban scholars to allocate scarce resources optimally is what the economists do thus economists can do a lot of contributions in the battle with covid-19 where urban scholars can add more from the city related perspectives undoubtedly economists and urban scholars can do more to the solutions of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic worldwide in this sense this paper is just a beginningall by lu liuall data utilized in the present study are publicly availablethe author declares no competing intereststhe perception of the covid-19 pandemic in my homeland croatia has been based on two main sources of information over the past three weeks on the one hand our civil protection headquarters as well as all of the experts and scientists to whom media space has been provided called for caution but without any panic they emphasized that this was not a cataclysm but an epidemic involving a serious respiratory infectious disease the cause of this disease is the new coronavirus for which we do not have a vaccine therefore it can be expected that the disease will be very dangerous for the elderly and to those who are already ill so it was an unknown danger worthy of caution but our epidemiologists remained calm they knew that they would be able to estimate the epidemics development using data and then control the situation with anti-epidemic measures and through several lines of defence 1on the other hand the people of croatia also followed the events in italy from there day after day apocalyptic news came with incredibly large numbers of infected and dead daily reports from italy seemed completely incompatible with what the experts and scientists in croatia were saying some have concluded that a scenario similar to that in italy if not worse is inevitable for croatia the population was in a very confusing situationin this text i will try to penetrate the very core of the infodemia that has been present in the media across many european countries as well as on social networks over the past three weeks i will explain how that disturbing situation arose and offer a scientific explanation for it this seems important at this point because the italian tragedy with the covid-19 epidemic has unfortunately hindered the credible and scientifically-based communication of the epidemiological profession to the population of croatiain my article 20 key questions and answers on coronavirus posted on the 9th of march 2020 on indexhr 1 in answer to question number 18 with the effectiveness of quarantine in china can we draw some lessons from this pandemic i statedif the virus continues to spread throughout 2020 it will demonstrate in a very cruel way how well the public health systems of individual countries are functioning these will be very important lessons in preparation for a future pandemic which could be even more dangerouswe are now slowly entering a phase where many countries have been exposed to the pandemic for sufficiently long to be able to make some first estimates of their results from these days up until the end of the pandemic we will see that covid-19 will divide the world into countries that have relied on epidemiology and followed the maths and the logic of the epidemic as well as those in which this isnt the case and many sadly probably quite unnecessarily  will sufferan epidemic is a serious threat to entire nations during which citizens interest in other topics may vanish quite rapidly we could see that happening quite clearly in the past several weeks the task of epidemiologists is to constantly have tables in front of them with a large number of epidemic parameters reliable field figures and formulas to monitor the epidemics development and to know the laws of epidemics in order to organize the implementation of anti-epidemic measures in a timely manner and thus protect the populationnow lets look at the countries that we can already point out as being successful in their response to this new challenge first and foremost there is china it has completely suppressed the huge epidemic in wuhan which spread to all thirty of its provinces in doing so it relied on the advice of its epidemiologic legend 83-year-old zhong nanshan twenty years ago nanshan gained authority by suppressing sars although surprised by the epidemic they managed to suppress covid-19 throughout china through expert and determined measures they did so over just seven weeks with the death toll eventually coming to a halt at less than 4000 2 by comparison it would be as if the number of deaths in croatia as a result of this epidemic was kept at around 14 in totalfurthermore if at some point you find yourself caught up in the uncertainty surrounding the danger of covid-19 you should be able to learn more if you look at the state of things in singapore despite intensive exchanges of people and goods with china since the outbreak of the epidemic singapore has a total of 732 infected people as i am writing this article with two dead and 17 more in intensive care 2 for a long time this city-state has been nurturing the ambition to lead the world in all measurable parameters from this it must be concluded that the developments in singapore are a likely reflection of the real danger of covid-19 in a country that is based on knowledge technology good organization and general responsibility also singapore had a relatively recent sars experience and learned from it so they built capacity and ensured speed in their response to future challenges the situation in singapore therefore is an indicator of the effects of the virus on the population to the extent that it is truly unavoidableany deviation towards something worse than the singaporean results will be less and less of a consequence of the danger of the virus itself and increasingly attributable to human omissions in doing so human errors that can lead to the unnecessary spread of the infection are 1 omission to properly understand the epidemic parameters 2 reluctance to make decisions based on the changes in those parameters and 3 the irresponsible behavior of the population in complying with instructions from the authoritiesto confirm the statements about singapore lets look at the current situation in other countries that rely on knowledge and expertise and have good organization they were also the most common destinations for the spread of the epidemic from china in the first wave hong kong japan south korea the united arab emirates and qatar there were only 519 infected people in hong kong at the time of writing this article with 4 deaths and 5 more people in a serious condition in japan 1499 were infected 49 were dead and 56 were in a serious condition in south korea which had a severe epidemic behind its first line of defence 9478 were infected 144 died and 59 were seriously ill in the united arab emirates 405 were infected 2 died and 2 were seriously ill and in qatar 562 were infected 6 were seriously ill and still no one had died from covid-19 2fortunately croatia is now up there with all of these countries with 657 infected 5 dead and 14 more seriously ill 2 as you can see pretty clearly from all of these figures in countries that rely on the knowledge and the profession and properly applied anti-epidemic measures covid-19 is a disease that should not be life-threatening for more than a tiny percentage of all infected people this conclusion can still be reached if it is properly understood that the information on the number of cases and deaths at the website httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus 2 is based on positive tests and not on everyone who is actually infected we need to do further research to understand the denominator for the case-fatality rate properlywhat then is happening in italy as well as in spain but to a good extent also in france switzerland belgium austria denmark and portugal i did not include germany sweden the netherlands the united kingdom and the united states in this group of countries for now this is because at least for some time during the pandemic they have clung to the idea of intentionally letting the virus spread and infect at least part of the populationgiven all of the previous examples of a successful epidemiological response and what is now practically the coexistence of people with the new coronavirus in asias most developed countries how is it possible for italy to have nearly 85 000 infected people and over 9000 deaths at the time of this article or that spain has 72 000 infected people and more than 5600 deaths and france has almost 33 000 infected people and 2000 deaths or that even switzerland which everyone would expect to see among the most successful countries in any of these world rankings could already have 13 250 infected people and 240 deaths with 203 more critically ill people 2 the causes of all of this are however becoming increasingly clear to sciencefirst of all there was probably a premature relaxation around the real danger of covid-19 in europe the epidemic development by the end of february was already quite similar to the one seen previously with sars and mers in both of those epidemics the primary focal point was suppressed then the virus was stopped using the first line of defence  identifying all those infected tracing their contacts and isolating them all  in more than 25 countries by the end of february 2020 it was already clear in the case of covid-19 that it would be successfully suppressed in its primary focal point  wuhan it was also already stopped using the first line of defence in another thirty chinese provinces and surrounding countries in asia then on the 28th of february the first estimates of death rates were published suggesting that it was a disease with a death rate significantly lower than that of sars and mers 34 at that time it was reasonable to expect that the epidemic could soon be stopped as a result the world health organisation delayed the declaration of a pandemic until the 11th of march and the world stock markets increased by about 10 percent from the 27th of february to the 3rd of march 56 but for any unknown virus premature relaxation is very dangerous as will be shown later with covid-19second it is possible that chinese tourists from wuhan were visiting northern italy in january and february 2020 fever does not accompany all covid-19 cases and asymptomatic transmission is possible so infected tourists could have been allowed to enter italy even where proper checks at the airports were in place 4 italy cancelled flights linking it directly with china on january 31 following the news of the epidemic spread 7 some investigative journalists hypothesized although this has not been confirmed that it may be possible that the phenomenon of the mass immigration of chinese workers to northern italy may have contributed to the early introduction and spread of the virus 8 tens of thousands of chinese migrants work in the italian textile industry producing fashion items leather bags and shoes with the brand made in italy they worked in conditions where they were cramped closely together which would facilitate the spread 8-10 reuters and the reporter d t max wrote about this phenomenon back in 2014 and 2018 respectively 910 partly as a result of this development direct flights between wuhan and italy were introduced previous reports claimed that there may be many illegal migrants among those workers 910 whether through chinese tourists textile workers or through some other route the novel coronavirus has triggered an epidemic behind the back of the italian first line of defence which remained unrecognized in the first few weeksthird infected people from northern italy spent their weekends at european ski resorts although we do not know if the arrival of the warmer weather will stop the transmission of coronavirus what we can assume is that the cold helped it to spread that is why european ski resorts became real nurseries of coronavirus in late february and in early march as many media reported 1112 in this way more infected people emerged behind the front lines of defence in france switzerland belgium austria denmark and spain their first lines of epidemiological defence focused on air transport from asia not on their own skiing returnees where indeed no one would expect a large number of chinese people from wuhan to befourth although spain may not have had as many skiers as other european countries in this cluster the virus may have been introduced to them through a biological bomb on the 19th of february a champions league football match was held between italys atalanta and spains valencia atalanta is a team from a small city of bergamo italy which has 120 000 inhabitants this was possibly the biggest game in atalantas history as it progressed through group stages to the last 16 in the european champions league the local stadium was not large enough for everyone who wanted to attend the game so it was moved to a large san siro stadium in milan the official attendance was 45 792 meaning that a third of bergamos population with around 30 busses travelled from bergamo to milan and then wandered the streets of milan before the game 1314 unfortunately for spain nearly 2500 valencia fans also travelled to the match as atalanta scored four goals a third of bergamos population was hugging and kissing in the cold weather four times and spent the day closely together this is likely why it became the worst-hit region of italy by some distance moreover at least a third of valencia football squad also got infected with a virus and later played alaves in the spanish league where further players of that team got infected this football game has certainly contributed to the virus making its way to spain 14fifth it is very important for the early development of the epidemiological situation in each country to look at which subset of the population the virus has spread among northern italy has a very large number of very old people in the early stages of the epidemic the virus began to spread in hospitals and retirement homes 1516 they did not have nearly enough capacities to assist in severe cases among already sick elderly and immunocompromised people the virus spread more easily and faster and had a significantly higher death rate in some other countries such as germany most of the patients in the early stages were between the ages of 20 and 60 and were returning from skiing trips or were business people 17 therefore such countries have a significantly lower death rate among those first infectedsixth this is likely the most important factor required to explain the current situation in italy and other european union eu countries there must have been either the omission to monitor the mathematical parameters of the epidemic or perhaps the lack of clear communication of the dangers or the indecisiveness to adopt isolation measures for the population it is difficult to know at this time which of these three causes is the most important  a combination of them all is entirely possible however the nature of the omission largely explains the terrible figures on infections and deaths that are being reported from italy and other eu countries on a daily basisto understand the tragedy in italy and europe we must first return to wuhan when the epidemic broke out the chinese first had to isolate the virus then they needed to read its genetic code and develop a diagnostic test it all took time as the epidemic spread rapidly throughout the city when they began testing for coronavirus between the 18th and the 20th of january they had double-digit numbers of infected people 3 those numbers apparently stagnated so the epidemiologists did not know what that might mean but on the 21st of january the number of newly infected people jumped to more than 100 on the 22nd of january it jumped to more than 200 3 this was a clear signal to chinese epidemiologists that an exponential increase in the number of infected people was occurring at that time they had nothing further to wait for or to think about if the virus breaks through the first line of defence  and the chinese didnt even have any since the epidemic started there unannounced  then a quarantine measure needs to be triggered this prevents the virus from spreading further and generating a large number of infected people through the exponential growth of the epidemicafter such a sudden declaration of quarantine in wuhan the huge epidemic wave had actually just begun to show everyone who was already infected began to develop the disease in the next several days the maximum daily number of new infected cases was reached on the 5th of february on that day alone as many as 3750 new patients were registered in wuhan 3 this means that the jump from about 125 to about 250 newly registered infected persons signals to epidemiologists that they should expect an epidemic surge in 14 days with as many as 3750 newly infected people at the peaklet us now explain the time delay between people getting infected with a virus and the health systems ability to detect those infected based on their symptoms the new coronavirus kills primarily because it spreads incredibly quickly among humans as a result it creates a gigantic number of infected and sick in a very short time period table 1 among those who are sick about 5 will require intensive hospital care if all of them could receive optimal care we would be able to save nearly everyone but if they all get very sick at the same time then we cannot offer adequate care to everyone as a result most critical cases will die this is the main reason why this virus kills so many people in those countries which allowed it to spread freely for too long this is shown in a simple way in this table based on day-to-day growth in a number of cases by 26 which was a very realistic scenario for most eu countrieswith this in mind let us now look at the italian and other eu countries reaction to their own epidemic in view of what croatia did in the early stages of infection spreading in a country one or two infected persons are usually detected dailypersonally i advised the croatian authorities and public through social networks to start seriously thinking about social exclusion measures when they noticed a first notable shift from the first 10 confirmed infections towards the first 20 infected people on the 12th of march i posted a facebook status entitled contrast is the mother of clarity which was viewed and shared by many thousands of my fellow croatians who have been following my popular science series on the pandemics  the quarantine of wuhan this status has also been shared by many online and printed newspapers and media in croatia including radio stations 18 in that status i suggested that croatia should consider a large quarantine because we had already jumped from 14 to 19 infected people the day before however i also warned them to weigh this decision carefully against economic implications and their expected long-term effects on health the very next day on the 13th of march a decision was made in croatia to close the schools 1819that meant that up to that point croatia completed two of the most important tasks in this pandemic the first task was to hold its first line of defence this was being achieved through the identification of infected cases imported from other countries and their isolation and that of all their contacts croatia completed this first task better than the other eu countries based on an average percentage increase of cases between the 3rd of march and the 17th of march then from march 13th croatia also began to introduce social exclusion measures at the right time thus successfully carrying out the second key task in controlling its own epidemic many credits for this should be attributed to its epidemiologists who work at the croatian institute for public healthbut what went wrong with these two measures in italy and other eu countries on the 21st of february the number of confirmed infected cases in italy jumped from 3 to 20 as italy is a more populous country than croatia it might have still been too hasty to send all of lombardy into quarantine based on this but on the 22nd of february the jump was from 20 to 62 cases and this should lead to some serious thought about social isolation measures a couple of days later on the 24th of february they reached a situation very similar to that in wuhan before a strict quarantine the number of confirmed infections jumped from 155 to 229 this was particularly worrying in italy because they did not seem to proactively test at that time eitherthe jump from 155 to 229 in combination with the wuhan experience should have suggested that they would have at least 50 000 infected people under the predicted curve of the epidemic wave and they were just seeing its early beginning of it such a large number would imply that about 2500 affected would require intensive care units at the time lombardy had only about 500 such units in governmentstate facilities and another 160 in private health care facilities 20 as early as the 24th of february it was clear that there would be many deaths in lombardy weeks later with epidemics everything goes awry because the infected get sick a week later and some of the patients then die ten to twenty days later this time delay is a critically important factor that needs to be taken into accounthowever even then the italians did not declare a quarantine they did not do so on the 29th of february either when the total number of infected people rose from 888 to 1128 those figures implied that in mere days they would be having about 15 000 newly infected people each day they did not declare quarantine on the 4th of march either when the number of infected people exceeded 3000 and when the world stock exchanges started to fall again it had then become clear to most epidemiologists who have been advising global investors that an unexpected tragedy was about to unravel in italy and this was now inevitable at that point italy already had at least 30 000 infected people spreading the infection the quarantine was declared for lombardy on the 8th of march 7 the day before the number of cases had already risen and exponentially so to as many as 5883to appreciate the problem with epidemic spread in the population behind the first line of defence this is similar to borrowing 1000 from someone on the 29th of february with an interest rate of 26 each day meaning an interest rate of 26 on top of that the next day and so on furthermore there did not seem to be enough clear and decisive communication with the public the news of the quarantine for lombardy was in fact leaked to the media before it was officially announced this led to a quick escape of many students to the south of the country to their homes carrying the contagion with them as a result on the 10th of march all of italy had to be quarantined 7in an already difficult situation where every new day of delay meant another thousand or more people dying as we can all notice these days there were numerous media reports warning that the population may not have taken those measures as seriously as the chinese when they introduced orders to their population in wuhan 2122 any indiscipline under such grave circumstances could have allowed the virus to take yet another step quite easily with each new step another 26 of interest was added to everything before that and then 26 on everything on everything before that again that is the power of exponential growth characteristic of the free spread of the virus in the populationmany italians and then spaniards as well as residents of several other wealthy countries in europe had their lives cut short by their lack of recognition of the dangers of exponential function during the spread of the epidemic delaying quarantine for a week made the epidemic ten times worse than it should have been delaying it for two weeks made it a hundred times worse and after two weeks of it being finally proclaimed all those who may have not taken the orders seriously enough would have made the epidemic several hundred times worse this means that in italy and possibly in spain too we are now observing the covid-19 epidemic that is more than a hundred times worse than it should have been in a country that was much better prepared for the response such as singapore taiwan hong kong or the united arab emiratesto appreciate what is happening in italy it is enough to think of this sentence alone at least 100 times fewer people would die each day if quarantine had been declared 2 weeks earlier and had the population stuck to the recommendations during those fourteen days between 23rd of february and 7th of march they allowed the virus to spread freely and infect a huge number of people  maybe even up to a million or perhaps more it is very difficult to know at this point this would mean tens of thousands of people in need of intensive care with about ten times fewer units available nationwide about half of those who fall seriously ill will not survive without the necessary support at this point whenever we hear that 1000 people died in italy in one day we should know that the casualties would only add up to 10 had the quarantine been declared just a couple of weeks earlier i appreciate that it seems implausible that the delay of a political decision like the introduction of quarantine by just two weeks may mean the difference between 100 deaths and 10 000 deaths in the 21st century however i am afraid that this is unfortunately the reality of the exponential growth of the number of infected during an epidemicwhat does this mean for the public in countries like croatia who were confused and in awe of the events in italy they should know that they did not observe what the covid-19 epidemic should actually look like in a country where the epidemiological service and its communication with those in power works well as it does in singapore taiwan or south korea in italy we have unfortunately noticed the consequence of a free spread of the epidemic for too long such a development was not predictable the biggest surprise of this pandemic to date to the community of epidemiologists is undoubtedly the lack of response by the authorities of many eu countries to the apparent spread of the pandemic at an exponential rate for weeks leading to a very large numbers of infected people in a very short time it is even more surprising that although the italian example exposed this problem quite clearly a similar scenario is now happening in several other european countrieshow and why could this happen in italy and then in other countries in the european union eu i will try to offer at least some hypotheses first eu countries have been living in prosperity for decades focused mainly on their economies aside from the economic questions they have not had any challenges that theyve had to answer to swiftly and decisively that would measure up to this one back in the 1960s vaccines were introduced against most major infectious diseases especially childhood ones malaria is no longer present in europe and tuberculosis has been treated similarly for decades the challenge of hivaids in the 1980s is now being successfully controlled with antiretroviral drugs liver inflammation is treated mainly by clinicians the impact of influenza is controlled through vaccination while rare zoonoses are resolved with immunoprophylaxis even sexually transmitted infectious diseases stds are no longer as significant since the vaccine for human papillomavirus hpv was licensedthe last real epidemic that concerned europe was the hong kong flu which occurred back in 1968 and 1969 the broad field of biomedicine offers such a wide range of exciting career paths to all those students who study it these days but the epidemiology of infectious diseases is not really one of them  or at least it hasnt been in europe for a very long time it has probably begun to seem like an archaic medical profession to the majority of students and young medical doctors it seemed to belong to the past for the european continent which made it one of the least attractive things to specialize ineven the rare epidemiologists who specialized in infectious diseases have begun retraining for chronic non-communicable diseases due to the aging of europes population which is particularly the case in italy and spain it seems that at least some eu countries may have fallen victims to their own decades-long success in the fight against infectious diseases they faced this unexpected pandemic with few experts that could have had any experience in these events asian countries as well as canada have had enough recent experience with sars and mers but some european countries seem to have forgotten how to fight infectious diseases if it were not for the legacy of the great croatian epidemiologist social medicine expert and global public health pioneer dr andrija tampar and the relatively recent war in croatia it is difficult to say whether or not croatia would be as ready as it has proven itself to beanother factor that would understandably undermine the italian response was that no one before italy in fact could have observed how fast covid-19 was spreading among the population the greatest danger of covid-19 is its accelerated exponential spread when it breaks through the first line of defence but before italy only the chinese in wuhan and the iranians had experienced the free spread of the infection among their population after five days of monitoring the number of infected the chinese had to quarantine the entire wuhan and then further 15 cities a day later in order to contain the virus they did not know how many infected people were there outside of wuhans hospitals for iran however only a few knew exactly what was happening as that country is significantly isolated internationally due to political reasons the koreans however had a limited local epidemic but not an uncontrolled free spread  they caught the virus using their first line of defencethat is how the italians ended up becoming the first country in the highly developed world to monitor their epidemic spreading uncontrollably among the population the only estimate of the rate of spread of the virus to date has been in the scientific work of li et al from the 29th of january 23 however it was difficult to subsequently determine r0 parameter on the first 425 patients in wuhan the estimate of the r0 for covid-19 in their article was 22 but with a very wide confidence interval  from 14 to 39 it is a bit of tough luck for the italians again that they calculated the lower bound of the confidence interval to be 14 exactly this figure is well known to all epidemiologists its the rate of the spread of seasonal flu in the community it should come as no surprise that many epidemiologists would guess that with more data r0 for covid-19 would start converging more towards 14 unfortunately the more recent data suggests that r0 is more likely to lean towards 39 implying an incredibly fast spread thus the greatest danger of covid-19 remained unrecognized in italy until the 8th of march quarantine measures at least 100 times fewer people would be dying in italy these days had they declared a quarantine for lombardy two weeks earlier than they didjust a few days ago an extremely useful piece of scholarly work authored by onder et al became available 24 their contribution finally provided answers to the three great unknowns about covid-19 many hypotheses have been presented in the media to explain the developments in italy since the very outbreak of the epidemic but thanks to just one simple table we can now dispel most of themthe first is the question that has plagued us for a long time  how dangerous is covid-19 for younger age groups it is clear that the media will tend to single out individual cases of death in younger people as they are of most public interest however it is interesting that until recently we didnt really have decent data on this in the public domain the first reason was that the chinese centre for disease control reported all deaths in the chinese epidemic using age groups structure that contained a very large age group of 30-79 years it only separated children up to 10 years then adolescents up to 20 years then 20-29 year-olds followed by this broad age group 30-79 years and those who were 80 years or older that is why the work of onder and colleagues is commendable as they subdivided this large group from china into 10-year age groups this finally allowed a comparison between the first 1023 deaths in wuhan up to the 11th of february with the first 1625 deaths in italy up to the 17th of march the comparison is shown in table 2it gives us some very important insightsfirst in italy more than half of the deaths initially were among people who were older than 80 years of age and a total of 88 of the deaths occurred among the persons over 70 years of age so contrary to the impression that individual media reports can easily make covid-19 is a very dangerous disease mainly for old people moreover a recent study by a and g remuzzi 25 showed that among 827 deaths in italy the vast majority of those people were already severely ill with underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease diabetes and malignancies this is what epidemiologists expected because a more severe flu would have had a similar effect if there was no vaccine available however i doubt that the general public has the proper insight into this issue from the prevalent media reportssecond it was suggested in the media across europe that the virus in italy may have mutated and become much more dangerous however table 2 shows that death rates by the age of 70 are practically the same in china and italy then although the case fatality rate appears to be about 50 greater in italy than in china for the age group 70-79 this does not suggest that the virus may have mutated it is known that in wuhan many of the affected with a severe clinical presentation of covid-19 could rely on the two newly built hospitals and respiratory aids that the military had brought in from other parts of china 26 they also had medical teams coming in from other provinces 26 in italy however there were not enough respirators for this age group and there werent enough doctors either as many of them themselves became infected 1620 for those two reasons i would in fact expect even a larger difference between italy and china than the one we are seeing so i would not attribute this observed difference to the impact of the virus itself and finally the reported difference in case-fatality rates for the oldest age group should also not be attributed to the virus it is more likely a consequence of the fact that italians of lombardy live on average longer than the chinese of wuhan 27 therefore there are significantly more people in the oldest age group in italy ranging to much higher ages so the two oldest groups are not really comparable the average age of the italians in the age group 80 years or older is significantly greater than the average age of the oldest chinese age group therefore the table shows practically equal death rates across all age groups on sufficiently large samples meaning that the virus did not mutate in italy from the virus we see from wuhan at least not until the 17th of march 2020third and perhaps most importantly  this chart has now made it quite clear that covid-19 does not in fact kill people under the age of 50 unless they have some sort of underlying disease or some unknown achilles heel in their immune system that makes them particularly susceptible to the virus there are such cases with every infectious disease they are also present during the flu epidemics but they are extremely rare this suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses here after this table it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available however at least a few more studies need to be carried out to confirm that this age group can be substantially protected to provide reassurance that the virus is not becoming more dangerous for those younger than 50 years toothere is another strangeness to the situation in italy that will not be intuitive to the general public the actual number of deaths attributable to covid-19 in italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends namely at present due to the sole focus on the epidemic most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to covid-19 however once the epidemic is over it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years it could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month or a year even without being infected with the new coronavirus it is possible that among some of them covid-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months some of the deaths observed during the epidemic in italy may need to be reclassified later and attributed to underlying diseases in accordance with expected levels and those above expected levels will then be attributed to covid-19this article provides an explanation from the epidemiologists point of view for most of the events reported so far in italy and then followed in spain and other european countries a combination of an early relaxation over this epidemic systematic lack of expertise in the field of epidemic infectious diseases in europe likely inexperience in containing epidemic spread in this generation of health workers relaxed immigration regulations for workers in certain industries champions league football event and a series of further misfortunes and omissions have all been implied so far in the media as contributors to the late withdrawal of lombardy into quarantine this allowed through exponential growth for a large number of people to be infected in a very short time  far too large for health systems of italy and other eu countries to cope with severe forms of illness led to many deaths due to respiratory failure in 88 of cases people over 70 years of age died who had underlying illnesses in the large majority of cases this viewpoint is based on the first 1625 deaths in italy and by the time of this writing there are now more than 10 000 dead given the size of the population this would correspond to 670 deceased in croatia if croatia manages not to follow the numbers of deceased seen in italy this will mostly be attributable to social exclusion measures being introduced early enough for its health system to come with severe casesthese days the people of italy spain and other european countries are suffering large losses a significant underlying cause may be the problem that the human brain simply cannot intuitively grasp the power of exponential growth nor that two weeks of delay could make the difference between 100 and 10 000 deaths any physics enthusiasts will know the quote attributed to the great albert einstein who is often cited saying that compound interest which leads to exponential growth is the most powerful force in the universe or the eighth wonder of the world he who understands it earns it he who doesnt pays it 28as is detailed below this kind of program would be expensive these high costs and the concerns that some lower-income country policy-makers are hoping that pandemic will not hit hard have led to delays against incurring such costs 8 for example the fact that african countries are spending 08 of 1 of gdp on fighting the virus while richer countries are spending 8 suggests that many poorer countries have indeed been slow to act 9this argument could of course be countered with humanitarian arguments for saving lives however there are at least two stronger economic counterarguments on behalf of undertaking such a program first the value of the lives saved even under conservative assumptions will far exceed the costs of the assistance and the economic disruptions that prophylactic policies would entail and second the deeper reduction in per capita income possibly for a longer period of time will similarly be multiples of the likely program costs 10 11nevertheless some may agree with the policy-makers who are concerned about the nature of the bet for undertaking public spending on fighting a virus that either may not appear or may appear in a mild form in such a case the program costs would be real while if the virus does not appear its costs would not however in just 10 weeks the virus has already affected more than three million people in 190 countries 12 there is no reason to expect this rapid spread to stop at the door of poorer countries moreover the virus comes at an inauspicious moment for emerging economies it has accompanied a sharp drop in real oil pricesa central driver of sub-saharan africas growthto 1950 levels 13 job losses of migrants in north america europe and the middle east that will greatly reduce the remittances they send home remittances which are multiples of foreign aid sent to the affected countries 18 developing countries in debt distress or high risk of debt distress 14 and perhaps most of ominously an emerging deep contraction in global gdp 15 the longer it takes to place the bet the larger the bet will have to be to realize the same gains waiting is costly in lives and treasure 16the largest expenditure of these items would be the grants required to fund the living expenses of the poor who work largely in the informal sector usually on a daily basis one way to begin to think about the costs involved in pursuing a lockdown in these locations of the sort being undertaken in most countries is to consider the per capita income of the population of developing countries the imf estimates that in 2019 dollars this was 5380 17 slum inhabitants of course have a lower than average per capita income but exactly how much lower is difficult to say for a number of reasons first because in most cities the share of the population in slums exceeds the poverty rate so by definition many slum dwellers are not in poverty second urban income levels tend to be on the order of 20 above that of their rural counterparts so the average urban per capita income is higher in cities than the national figure 18 to get a very rough sense of how much funding would be required a figure that could be much more accurately estimated suppose the per capita income of slum dwellers is one-fifth of the average national figure ie about 1100 providing that level of support for 3 months to the roughly one billion slum dwellers less than 3 per day comes to 275 billion and that amount it is important to remember is only a beginning 19 more may well be needed over time the point is not that the estimate is accurate but that almost certainly it will be a very large amount and it is a significantly larger amount than the funding that the international institutions have pledged in additional assistance 19to consider just how large this figure is consider how it compares with the new efforts to respond to combat covid-19 the african development bank has established a 10 billion emergency fund 20 the world bank has similarly developed a 14 billion emergency fast disbursing health loan mechanism and a 160 billion fast disbursing coronavirus relief fund in addition along with the imf the world bank is calling for 14 billion in debt relief by bi-lateral donors as a first step in a more comprehensive program 21 these programs should help address some of the health-related expenditures taken to fight the virus at the same time the government of india has budgeted 23 billion for income relief during a 21-day lockdown while the brazilian government is discussing a separate coronavirus war budget of 100 billion also to provide income maintenance for informal sector workers cumulatively these amounts are clearly significant but much of their focus is on the health-related concerns and general income assistance rather than on where the resources can be most effectively targeted to reduce the spread of the virusthe slum-coronavirus paper also calls for foundations to help fund income maintenance for slum dwellers this approach i believe would be a mistake the amounts needed could easily go beyond what even large foundations could provide on a sustainable basis a far better would be the approach that the rockefeller foundation followed in new orleans in the wake of hurricane katrina or that of the ford foundation in detroits revival in both cases as well as in the gates foundations imaginative approach to funding for the development of the manufacturing capacity for seven of the most promising vaccines the aspiration was to focus on innovation rather than subsistence 22 in the gates case it went beyond just securing the supply chains to try to help build an essential one more rapidly the funding supports different vaccine options in the hope that at least one of them will work so that a vaccine can be quickly produced at scaleimmediate food assistance is also given priority by the slum-coronavirus paper this recommendation is vitally important given the problems with the access to food described in the world banks recent review of the effects of covid-19 on sub-sahara africa 23 a slow response in these communities could lead to starvation and increased immune deficiency in addition food prices in many emerging economies particularly in sub-saharan africa are already much higher than is the case in developed countries and it is likely that they will increase rapidly 24 particularly when it is noted that breakdowns in supply chains are already occurring 25one step that can contribute to less price gouging while simultaneously having minimal adverse effects on supply would be to declare a moratorium on rent payments the paper calls for a stop to evictions this step will almost certainly increase rent arrears going further and stopping rent payments altogether would provide immediate relief to poor households and allow them to use these funds to purchase the food needed so that malnutrition does not weaken the immunity needed to resist the virus the reduction in the income of landlords could be compensated for at a later datenobel laureate paul romer argues that if testing can be applied to 7 of the population even with a high rate of false positives and those found to be infected were isolated for 14 days it would be possible for the numbers afflicted to not continue to expand 26 such a level of testing will not be achieved in emerging economies for example in iceland the worlds leading tester 10 of the population has been tested 10 weeks after the first case 27 so instead of striving to achieve such high levels of testing resources could be targeted on geographical areas and occupations that would allow this to be achieved with lower rates of testing slum communities provide rich samples of both populationsthose whose location and informal occupationswhich again put them in the so-called fat tails of the distributions of those likely to be affected moreover within those communities more precise targeting such as of food vendors could be highly productivesuch fat tail targets are particularly attractive when it is recognized both how important testing is and that the numbers tested are likely to be far lower in emerging economies it may be even more important if the uncertain etiology of the virus is asymptomatic as some early survey results indicate may be the case as a number of recent studies have shown if covid-19 is indeed asymptomatic the much higher economic costs of lockdowns can be reduced if testing is available so that those infected but not ill can return to work less economic activity can be shut down 28 the result would be lower economic costs without an increase in sickness and deathfour measures are possible masks social distancing housing and migration to the countryside of the first three policies a recent study of african countries indicates that while masks and social distancing are helpful the most effective policy by far is to shield the vulnerable 29 a step that requires that some portion of the population be moved to more isolated housing the relative importance of shielding in turn has implications for how assistance is distributedafter a slow start in providing masks even for healthcare workers it is now recognized that masks are an effective way to slow the virus spread 30 hundreds of millions of masks are now being produced at low costsmask prices were on the order of 2 apiece in the usa before the crisisso even with price surges the main difficulty with this measure is the logistical one of moving large quantities of them to the right placesof course effective in reducing the spread of the virus as the incidence of covid-19 has been greatly reduced relative to model predictions in countries that have practiced such actions however the question remains as to how much social distancing can occur in settlements where the density is many times that of new york city where that citys lower density has played a significant role in the citys high rate of infection 31the slum-coronavirus paper calls for the building of new housing near to current locations to help reduce density this measure too could be highly effective and the world bank has experience in supporting many such projects both for disaster relief reconstruction and sites and services for new housing once again however the difficulty is not in providing the good it is in the logistics of how it should be done how can sufficient trust be developed so that the residents of slum communities agree that such relocations are not part of efforts to simply tear down the slums and destroy the housing of those who live there such destructions have a long history and their violence was one of the motivations for the world bank to begin to provide support for sites and services projects to create the trust needed to isolate the sick and the infirm requires community buy-inanother target of testing would be those who chose to migrate back to rural areas ideally they could be tested and certified as virus free before being allowed to migrate but such constraints and regulation are not likely to be achieved perhaps the tracking app for phones that is now under development by google and apple offers some promise on this scorethe papers foremost recommendation is to recognize and enhance the community organizations that can serve slum communities without the trust and guidance about the rich sources of information as to who lives in a community what are the most important needs and how best to address those needs in the highly idiosyncratic situations it is impossible to engage community members in addressing the very deep problems they face certainly efforts to shield the most vulnerable by separating them from their families as was done in china would face strong opposition without trust in the implementer in effect community organizations can serve as the agents of donors who are trying to protect both the communities and the broader societies they can help guide resource flows to those who need it most as well as to incorporate community knowledge about how to best use the resourceson first blush quickly establishing viable slum community groups to undertake such action would appear to be an impossible task but this is not the case as the slum-coronavirus paper indicates slum dwellers international sdi is an organization that has already established internet-based methods of sharing skills and practices across more than 30 countries for hundreds of thousands of slum dwellers 32 it has supported the implementation of large world bank loans and government programs in india south africa and elsewhere moreover sdis approach in some respects is more akin to developing a franchise than it is to building a community organization from scratch it provides fledgling community groups with a handbook and internet support as well as cross country visits to enable newly formed organizations to quickly establish community cohesion and sustainable community organizations this approach could easily be augmented by the webinar-based learning called for banerjee and duflo on how to most effectively address some of the concerns raised by the pandemic 33in thinking about the concerns of the vulnerable populations who reside in the slums of poorer countries it is of course essential to recognize the existential threat to the lives and well-being of the hundreds of millions of people who live there this threat should be motive enough to move quickly to provide the support needed and while it is clear that significant steps have already been called for and are beginning to be implemented it is also useful to think beyond the humanitarian motivation for assistance in this connection a biblical parable used by john maynard keynes often referred to as the father of macroeconomics is adaptable to the current situation he was discussing the role of profits in a capitalist economy and compared it to the endless supply of oil that was magically provided by a cruse or cup used by a widow to provide assistance to elijah he writes thus profits as a source of capital increment for entrepreneurs are a widows cruse which remains undepleted 34 in other words no matter how entrepreneurs spend their profits it does not diminish their wealth the supply of such income like the oil in the widows cruse is endlesswith only slight exaggeration and unfortunately it may be said that a similar situation applies to the effect that the large number of slum dwellers can have on supply of those infected by the coronavirus at least until a vaccine is found without assistance and if they act only as individuals rather than as communities they will be ravaged and in their attempts to flee from their disease-burdened locations the virus will continue to spread 34 thus the population of these communities present two high quality targetsdensely populated locations as well as large numbers of people who cannot isolate themselves because they have to work in order to live and because they live in such crowded conditions targeting assistance on them makes macroeconomic sense as well as providing distributional justicein late 2019 the world health organization was alerted to a cluster of pneumonia cases in wuhan city in china the novel coronavirus responsible for this outbreak was named 2019-ncov1 and the disease the virus causes is now known as covid-19 coronavirus disease 20192 the previously-unknown virus in question was later found to be highly transmissible with the average infected person spreading the disease to up to 3 other people3initially reported case fatality rates ranged from 25 to 34

5 prompting a global response communities around the world have been advised to stay in their homes as much as possible avoid gatherings frequently wash their hands or employ other hand hygiene techniques remain at least 12 m away from others social distancing and avoid touching their faces to avoid or delay transmission of 2019-ncov1

2 these guidelines would severely hamper many day-to-day activities if implemented at a high level of fidelity so voluntary compliance is likely to be uneven at besthealthcare professionals across all settings are now caring for and communicating with patients in a context of high uncertainty the ultimate impact of the covid-19 outbreak will not be clear for a long time but greater adherence to the lifestyle modifications suggested by healthcare and public health organizations will greatly delay the spread of the disease this in turn will keep hospitals and clinics from being overwhelmed for example hospitals are overburdened in parts of italy which is projected to have approximately 80 of its total icu beds occupied by covid-19 patients before april 20206 as healthcare professionals with a high public availability community pharmacists are likely to be many patients first option for health information patients may present to community pharmacies for refills or new prescriptions prescribers may cancel non-urgent appointments which would make the community pharmacist a sole point of in-person contact with the healthcare system it is therefore imperative that community pharmacists be equipped with knowledge and tools to communicate clearly and effectively with patients about ways to limit the impact of covid-19as the situation continues to develop over days and weeks instead of months and years community pharmacists are unlikely to have a ready-made and field-tested communication toolkit regarding covid-19 until after the time to act has passed in situations such as these evidence-based public health frameworks can provide a useful temporary measure in much the same way that prescribers may rely on data from small open label trials until data from higher-quality trials are available these public health frameworks can act as a checklist that pharmacists and other healthcare professionals can use to guide their communication and reinforce healthy behaviorsone such framework is the health belief model hbm the hbm was originally developed to study why patients may not seek screening for tuberculosis7 and is one of the most prominent public health frameworks for understanding why individuals may or may not act in the face of a threat to personal or community health the hbm has been used for decades to study vaccination medication adherence diabetes self-care condom use and other behaviors that require modification of a patients actions to mitigate a threat to health8

9 like many public health behavior models the hbm studies behavior at an individual and community level by conceptualizing the determinants of behavior into several contributing factors called constructs the hbm has evolved over time and many modified forms are present in literature this article will operationalize the hbm as pictured in fig 1
 adapted from champion and skinner7 broadly the hbm suggests that individual beliefs and direct cues to action inform behavior in turn beliefs are informed by ones background and are comprised of ones impression of the perceived threat the perceived benefits to taking action the perceived barriers to taking action and ones perceived ability to take action ie perceived self-efficacy the purpose of this article is to explain how community pharmacist can use the constructs of the hbm as a communication guide to move patients toward behaviors that will limit the spread of covid-19all constructs of the hbm are underpinned by an individuals background and experiences thus the community pharmacist should bear in mind the patients demographic characteristics socioeconomic status and knowledge base these things will interact directly with the constructs that comprise individual belief in the united states for example persons of lower socioeconomic standing may not have access to all of the tools needed to overcome all perceived barriers to action persons of differing ethnic backgrounds may react differently to calls for social distancing due to varying cultural attitudes and norms regarding interpersonal interactions an exhaustive list of how all modifying factors may interact with other hbm constructs in the context of covid-19 is beyond the present scope though some thoughts on modifying factors will be provided when discussing other constructs of the hbm as community members themselves community pharmacists are uniquely positioned to understand how these factors may impact their patients community pharmacists are encouraged to consider how their patients perspectives on covid-19 may differ from their own and to modify communication strategies accordinglyperceived threat and its predicatesperceived susceptibility and perceived severitymake the hbm well-suited to studying or modifying behaviors that may contribute to adverse health outcomes in the hbm an individual is considered more likely to take appropriate action if the perceived threat of the disease is large in turn the perceived threat will be larger if the perceived severity is largerthat is the disease is regarded as a serious problem similarly perceived threat will also be larger if perceived susceptibility is largerthat is the adverse outcome is regarded as something the individual could reasonably experiencewhen considering covid-19 in the context of the hbm community pharmacists may be poised to act most directly and most powerfully on these constructs educating the community on health risks is a core function of community pharmacy in most places and community pharmacists are likely to be trusted members of their communities acting on these constructs may mean educating on individual- or community-level threats incorporating patient-level modifying factors and epidemiological findings as appropriate for example early data strongly suggest that older patients with the disease are more likely to experience viral pneumonia hospitalization or other significant adverse health outcomes the odds of death may be as high as 15 in patients over the age of 804

5 patients are also more likely to experience severe illness with covid-19 if they have diabetes copd or cardiovascular disease at baseline or if they smoke or are male5
conversely pharmacists must be careful to avoid implying that there is no threat to younger healthier individuals the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that 38 of covid-19 hospitalizations may have occurred in patients under the age of 5510 it may be worthwhile to ask patients if they would tolerate a comparable chance of a similarly-negative avoidable outcome such as an automobile accident that results in injury community-level threats may also be salient to those at lower individual risk if a younger individual is from a culture that places a high value on family or the elderly the pharmacist may want to underscore the risks of transmitting the disease to family members or older community members again the pharmacist could ask if the individual would drive recklessly with valued family members in their automobile for instancesome discretion may be needed when interacting with members of the community who have anxiety disorders obsessive-compulsive disorder or other mental health concerns that may predispose to unhealthy fixation on the threat posed by covid-19 when interacting with these individuals community pharmacists may instead choose to leverage other constructs in the hbm to motivate behavior change without producing undue distress such as perceived benefits and perceived self-efficacy this may be an exception to previous guidance to deploy as many constructs of the hbm as possibleexample questions to assess threat constructshow big of a problem do you think the coronavirus ishow serious do you think it would be if someone like you got the coronaviruswhy do you think someone like you might contract the coronavirus
in the hbm perceived benefits are benefits that the individual may expect to accrue by undertaking the behavior in question this is distinct from simply avoiding an adverse health outcome which is covered by threat-related constructs for example a person who engages in smoking cessation behavior may avoid the perceived threat of chronic lung disease but may also accumulate the perceived benefit of having more money due to decreased expenditures on tobaccoin the case of the behaviors suggested in response to covid-19 community pharmacists may struggle to identify perceived benefits without knowing the individual in question however as previously noted personal relationships with community members are a unique strength of the community pharmacist perhaps patients who shift to a work-from-home paradigm will find they have more free time due to decreased commutes for instance more time at home may also mean more time with family members which could be welcome conversely it may also be an excellent opportunity to spend quality time alone if that is perceived as valuable spending time away from crowds may present an opportunity to cultivate a hobby or habit such as reading or hiking as time permits the community pharmacist may wish to explore the patients perspective on benefits may come with spending more time at homeexample questions to assess perceived benefitsare there any benefits to spending more time at home what are thosewell what are some of the things you havent had time to do around the housewhat hobbies havent you had time for
perceived barriers in the hbm are things that the individual feels may prevent them from making the desired behavior change in general as perceived barriers increase the individuals likelihood to engage with the behavior decreases therefore exploring ways to mitigate or remove perceived barriers will help individuals engage with the behavior in questionin the case of covid-19 prevention behaviors perceived barriers are likely to be profound in many cases many cultures are not configured to operate with minimal contact outside of the home for extended periods in most industrial and post-industrial economies people will likely need income to afford housing food and other essentials because of population density people living in urban areas may find it difficult to practice effective social distancing when they must leave their residences additionally some individuals may find the psychological distress that comes with spending more time away from others or the fear of the disease to be a barrier in its own right other individual factors may present special barriers such as having to find appropriate childcare following school closings many of these barriers may be beyond the capacity of a community pharmacist to resolve in a brief encounter but the pharmacist should be willing to work with and appropriately reassure a concerned patient as time constraints allowfinancial and vocational barriers are likely to be most profound with persons of lower socioeconomic status individuals who can work from home may be those whose jobs revolve around information technology in some way those jobs may be higher-paying conversely those in manufacturing or service sectors may find they suddenly have severely restricted income these individuals may therefore aggressively pursue any work outside the home community pharmacists can help address these barriers when they arise by supplying contact information for local governmental and nongovernmental organizations that may provide support for people who are experiencing economic distress these resources may include social workers local government aid agencies or even food pantriesexample questions to assess perceived barriershow difficult do you think it will be to stay at home unless you have to leavewhat might keep you from staying homei know some people are having trouble paying bills right now would you like information on community resources for you or people you know
perceived self-efficacy is the belief that one has the ability to overcome a given challenge note that perceived self-efficacy is distinct from actual self-efficacy if one does not actually possess the ability to overcome a challenge then perceived barriers are likely to be present instead perceived self-efficacy focuses on whether an individual feels empowered to pursue tactics that are likely to result in success many times perceived self-efficacy is essential one does not finish what one does not start and one does not start what one feels they can not finishcommunity pharmacists can help patients who express difficulties with perceived self-efficacy with respect to covid-19 prevention behaviors this may be as simple as listening to concerns regarding isolation and social distancing then reinforcing positive steps that have already been taken pharmacies can reinforce self-efficacy beliefs by working with patients who experiment with mail order refills drive-through pharmacy or other contact-minimization methods these measures can be presented to patients as proof of their ability to take effective action ultimately it will be vital to understand the individual and their contexts the preexisting relationships community pharmacists have with their patient populations will again be invaluableexample questions to assess perceived self-efficacyhow likely is it that you can take action to distance yourself from othershow overwhelming is the idea of coronavirushow confident do you feel about the future right now
in the hbm cues to action are prompts that remind individuals that they should act on a particular challenge this is another construct that community pharmacists are likely to act on in the course of everyday practice in the past this may have meant reminding patients of medication adherence behaviors or counseling on smoking cessation in the context of covid-19 prevention behaviors it may mean reminding patients standing in line to practice social distancing or advising patients who exhibit symptoms of covid-19 to quarantine themselves for the length of time suggested by their doctor community pharmacists should take care to practice cultural competence when providing guidance some communities and individuals will want their healthcare professionals to be cooperative and consultative while others may prefer simple clear directions from an expertcovid-19 presents a unique challenge to public health effective mitigation of the disease will require nontrivial efforts from a significant fraction of the world population including social distancing and avoiding unnecessary interactions with others no matter how stringently these measures are recommended a fraction of people may not believe that they can or should act in ways that will limit the threat the hbm is a model that has been used to study behaviors related to preventing or mitigating disease it conceptualizes beliefs about disease as being comprised of the perception of the threat as severe and relevant the perception of benefits of and barriers to acting and the perception of ones intrinsic ability to act as trusted community-facing healthcare professionals pharmacists are uniquely suited to bring about change in patient behaviors community pharmacists using hbm to reinforce covid-19 mitigation behaviors should appropriately emphasize the severity and susceptibility of the threat emphasize barriers to acting help patients identify ways to overcome barriers to acting and reinforce self-efficacy beliefspublic health frameworks such as hbm are not entirely foreign to pharmacy as a profession the transtheoretical states of change model has been used in the context of smoking cessation11 while the profession is likely less aware of other frameworks such as hbm there is reason to believe that pharmacists can deploy tools like hbm effectively ideally such a deployment would be accompanied by strong assessment tools however the speed with which the covid-19 situation is evolving necessitates a less evidence-based approach than might otherwise be usedlimitations of the hbm must be acknowledged unlike some other public health frameworks it does not directly incorporate constructs such as social norms and community assumptions which are instead baked in at the level of underlying demographic factors it is also unclear if the hbm applies directly to an effort as large as the ones being mobilized to combat covid-19 however this critique could be levied at most approaches that might be brought to bear on this unique situationcommunity pharmacists are likely to have a direct role in combating misinformation and helping patients select healthy behaviors to that end the hbms constructs of perceived threat perceived barriers perceived benefits perceived self-efficacy and cues to action can be immediately deployed to help reinforce covid-19 limiting behaviors such as social distancing and remaining in the home whenever possiblethis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectorsthe outbreak of covid19 which was initially conceived as a chinesecentric shock has now been understood to be a global crisis with the number of cases increasing rapidly the world health organization who on march 12 declared covid19 as a global pandemic the unprecedented outbreak of the virus has brought considerable human sufferings to every sphere of human lives in addition to the public health emergency the crisis has unpredictably hit the world economy the operations of the world economy have substantially come to a halt the economically challenging measures adopted across the countries such as bans on traveling imposing restrictions on labor mobility shutting down manufacturing companies and sharp cutbacks in service sector activities to contain the disease have produced enormous adverse effects on the economy however an accurate empirical assessment about the size and persistence of the pandemic and its likely impact on the world economy is yet unknowable the earlier pandemics sars avian flu mers had affected particularly those countries that were economically less dominant moreover the magnitude of the previous pandemics was much smaller than covid19 the effect of this virus is however economically different the number of infections is frequently changing on an hourly basis the top most affected economies out of the outbreak are united states italy china spain france united kingdom and germany these economies accidentally happen to be the worlds largest economies as well g7 economies have witnessed exponential growth in the number of confirmed cases these economies account 60 of the worlds demand and supply 65 of the worlds manufacturing and around 40 of manufacturing exports baldwin  di mauro 2020 therefore there is a saying going around that while these large economies sneeze the rest of the world will get the cold unctad projects that the slowdown in the world economy as a result of the outbreak of covid19 will cost around 1 trillion dollars according to the united nations the sudden decline in oil prices has been the major contributing factor to the global economic slowdown figure 1 highlights the loss in gdp growth worldwidealthough the pandemic is likely to affect the advanced economies most emerging economies like india cannot stand unaffected governments in many countries have expressed their concern and imposed lockdown to mitigate the rapid spread since india has imposed 21day lockdown nationwide with anticipation of extending it later the economic activities in the country have reached to a near halt by suspending the production process the states are incurring huge economic cost gollier and gossner 2020 the current situation of covid19 clubbed with plummeting economic growth has pushed the developing countries like india into a volatile market condition among all south asian countries india has recorded the maximum number of active coronavirus cases as of april 13 there has been total 9241 number of covid19 cases in india with 331 deaths figure 2 explains the total number of confirmed cases in india before the outbreak of covid19 indian economy had already been experiencing economic slowdown over the past few quarters the economy was already reeling under rising unemployment low consumption and weakening industrial output and prices precovid19 the economy was witnessing sluggish economic growth compounding the existing problems of rural distress malnutrition and widespread inequalityfurthermore indias vast informal sector is particularly vulnerable in 20172018 out of nations 465 million workers around 91 422 million workers were associated with the informal sector these economic constraints along with the current supply side shock have put the economy on an adverse situation it will be challenging to predict the scale and speed of the effect of covid19 on any economies however there is no doubt that the impact will be much pronounced than the demonetization in 2016 and 2017 gst rollout it appears to be apparent now that these two events that caused shocks to the economy and yet not recovered fully there is another shock ahead for the economy to face the similarity with the 2016s demonetization and 2017s gst does not end at their economic impact the indian economy was going through 6year low growth rate at 47 in the third quarter of the current fiscal year in the events of declining domestic investment and mean consumption rate several monetary and fiscal policy measures were taken to recover the growth rate at the end of the last quarter rbi in its biannual monetary policy report has emphasized that the outbreak of covid19 pandemic has drastically altered the outlook of the indian economy and it has been the high time for the policymakers to formulate some monetary and fiscal measures to curb the economic slowdown in india1 as the situation has not turned normal and the number of cases is increasing worldwide as well as at national level it has been anticipated that the occurrence of the virus will further deteriorate the recovery process in the near to medium term the outbreak has put a new set of challenges before the country by spreading its dangerous effect on both demand and supply sidefrom a public health perspective the ability to contain the outbreak in india will primarily depend upon the strength of the public health system in india as the number of confirmed cases in india is on the rise the capacity of the public health system in combating the pandemic is being questioned by the experts indias expenditure on health as a percentage of gdp is lower than the poorest countries in the world according to the national health profile in 2019 india spends only 128 of its gdp as public health expenditure2 world health organization ranks india 145 among 195 countries in terms of health care access and quality india ranks much below than china 48 sri lanka 71 bangladesh 133 and bhutan 134 in south asia the human resources and physical infrastructures of the public health system in india stand at an inferior stage while the private health care system is flourishing in india more than 65 population does not have health insurance putting massive pressure on the public hospitals in order to ensure the public health first the government of india on march 24 had announced 21 days effective nationwide lockdown the main objective of the lockdown was to maintain social distancing and suspend all forms of travel so that it can prevent the spread of infection from the infected at the community level india has very less number of hospitals and testing centers in india there is only one hospital per 47000 population states like himachal pradesh and arunachal pradesh have 12 and 16 hospitals respectively for per lakh population maharashtra which has witnessed the maximum number of coronavirus cases in india has only one hospital for every 16 lakh population statistics also reveal that on average there is only one doctor for 10700 people in india given this poor medical condition in india a genuine question arises how well prepared is indias public health system to deal with this crisis3 while testing needs to be an essential part to fight the crisis and contain the spread india does not have enough kits to test most of its population for the new coronavirus as of april 9 india has conducted a total of 144920 tests recording lowest test rates per capita in the world some states in india have reported no tests so far4
given the background this article attempts to answer a very crucial question that what is the economic effect of covid19 on the indian economy in general and its impact on different sectors in particular however before we discuss the economic repercussion of the pandemic we first and foremost consider this outbreak as a human tragedy there are no parameters that can account the human sufferings which the pandemic has brought as the outbreak of covid19 is spreading like wildfire some of the current economic explanations may stand redundant as the crisis evolves this article potentially reflects our perspective of covid19 on the indian economy as of april 13 through this article we address the following three aspects of covid19 pandemic in the context of the indian economy first we examine the effect of covid19 on different sectors of the economy such as the agricultural sector manufacturing sector and the service sector second we will highlight how the bilateral trade relation between india and china has been affected due to the outbreak third we present the impact of 21day nationwide lockdown on social consumption in india finally we conclude the article by highlighting the growth projections about india and recommending some policy implicationsboone 2020 identifies three relevant channels through which the pandemic can affect economic activities across the countries our study will be based on these three crucial channels
supply channel the first important channel is the supply channel with the disruptions in the production unit closures of factories irrespective of sizes cutbacks in the service sector especially the financial sector can result in a significant disruption in the global supply chain
demand channel as a consequence of the outbreak there will be a fall in demand in the travel and tourism sector the decline in the education services decline in trade contraction in demand for entertainment and leisure services
confidence channel the third crucial channel is the confidence channel amidst the global uncertainty there is a fall in the confidence pattern of consumers as there is less consumption of goods and services to contain the spread several containment measures have been adopted by several countries which are likely to affect the consumer and financial market confidence spillover effects are being transmitted through finance and confidence channel to financial markets
the pandemic has disrupted the agriculture activities and supply chains the monetary loss occurred to the agricultural sector in india amidst the outbreak of covid19 has been tremendous the nationwide lockdown has put the future prospectus of the agriculture sector at stake amidst the uncertainty the sector has been encountering several challenges as the labor mobility and movements of goods have been affected nonavailability of migrant labors is causing problems in harvesting activities the north and west region encountered significant problems as wheat and pulses are not being harvested on time there have been disruptions occurred in supply chains also because of the 21day lockdown in the country and subsequent bans on transportations and other activities it is being predicted that the sector is likely to get a double hit due to the recent uneven monsoon and economic contagion that the sector is facing as ravi harvest season is approaching farmers across the states are worried about their crops lying unharvested in the field the cultivation of wheat pulses and mustard has already witnessed a decline in its productions owing to untimely and heavy rainfall with the cases farmers and agricultural laborer are fleeing to their homes in the wake of this coronavirus lockdown farmers income is going to be affected severely following are the points through which we will highlight the negative effect of covid19 on indian agricultural sector first the supply chain of agricultural products will be heavily affected due to the coronavirus lockdown in india the 21day lockdown nationwide has created hindrance in the interstate movements of trucks carrying the essential agricultural commodities owners of warehouse and cold storage have complained over the lack of available labor supply in the agricultural sector second the outbreak can also affect agriculture and allied activities through its effect on the poultry sector the fastest growing sector in the indian agriculture ecosystem apparently india ranks third in terms of egg production and fifth in terms of the producers of broilers however due to the misinformation spread on social media and linking meat consumption to the coronavirus disease the sector is facing huge losses on a daily basis there has been a sudden fall in demand for poultry products and farmers are facing lower prices for their poultry products third as the restaurants and hotels are shut down the demand for agricultural products are plummeting in india as a result there has been a fall in the prices of farm products by 1520 in the time of this uncertainty in exports5
the pandemic has hit the manufacturing sectors across the globe in different ways since the outbreak initially emerged in the manufacturing heartland of the world east asia it is likely to disrupt the global supply chain in the industrial giants with the further spread of the virus the manufacturing sector across the world will experience a similar hit the supply chain contagion will create a direct supply shock to the manufacturing sectors in the less affected nations the less affected nations would find it harder to import the raw and possessed materials from the hardhit economies as a result of the pandemic subsequently there will be a demand disruption in both less affected and hardhit economies owing to the macroeconomic drops in aggregate consumption demand baldwin  di mauro 2020the indian economy was already struggling hard to recover from the economic slowdown prior to the outbreak however the continuing outbreak of covid19 in india has made the possibility of revival difficult as several sectors in the economy are witnessing an adverse effect of covid19 even the finance minister has assured that the government will take some stringent measures to help the manufacturing industries mainly the msmes to reduce the effect of covid19 on the sector on the manufacturing front the impact of the coronavirus will depend upon to the extent the sector is connected to china the pharmaceuticals and automobile industries are already facing the effect as the pharmaceutical industry is strongly linked to china the supply chain of raw materials of drugs has been affected immensely though india is considered to be the top exporters of drugs in the world it depends heavily on the import of bulk drugs in the financial year 20182019 india had imported around 24900 crores of bulk drugs and the import constitutes approximately 40 of the domestic consumption6 indias dependence on china for the import of many critical antibiotics and antipyretics accounts close to 100 the largest production unit of pharmaceutical in himachal pradesh is undergoing the lockdown incurring huge manufacturing loss in india on the other hand with the disruptions in the supply chain the automobile industry in india has also seen a severe impact the coronavirus outbreak not only has affected the automobile industry but also hit the automotive components and forging industries china accounts for 27 of exports of auto components in india and considers to be the leading supplier in india as the manufacturing industries in china were shut down in the wake of the coronavirus crisis many indian automobile companies have suffered the losses several automobiles companies including mahindra and mahindra mm tata motors and mg motors in india have announced that they are facings constraints in the supply of auto components from the virushit china7
as far as the chemical industries are considered the local dyestuff companies in india relies on china and imports several raw materials such as chemicals and intermediates from china due to the ongoing crisis the delayed shipments and the rising prices of raw materials are affecting the dyes and dyestuff industry particularly in gujarat the production of these items has been impacted by 20 due to the disruptions caused in the supply of inputs from china the spread of covid19 can also affect the electronic industries located in india china being the largest supplier of both final and raw material of electronic products the electronics industry in india fears supply disruptionseconomists are often criticized for producing bad records in predictions acknowledging the fact beck 2020 has recommended several ideas to interpret the effect of covid19 on the financial markets to him the effect of the coronavirus on financial markets will depend upon three significant conditions first to what extent the virus will further spread and its effect on economic activities worldwide second the effective implementations of fiscal and monetary policy to the crisis third the centrals banks and regulators reactions to the possible bank fragility applying these three conditions we examine the impact of covid19 on the indian financial system the effect of the coronavirus and the lockdown it triggered is visible on the financial markets in india the banking sector in india was already going through a crucial time even before the emergence of the crisis the collapse of yes bank created some hue and cry in the banking sector amidst the anomalies in the economic activities and deteriorations in the quality of the assets the rating agency moody has revised the prospectus of the indian banking system to negative from stable8 the outbreak of the virus will affect the profitability of banks adversely as there has been an increase in loanloss provisions and a decline in revenues the deterioration in the assets quality across micro small and medium enterprises msmes corporate and retail segments will induce a huge pressure on banks capitalization capital infusions to the public sector banks psbs as done by the governments over the past few years can mitigate the pressures on bank capitalization given the current situation where the private sector banks are facing default the growing risk aversion faced by the old private sector banks will put funding and liquidity pressures on small private sector banks the outbreak has also hit investor confidence in the financial market investor sentiment has been so low that despite relatively lower cases reported in india the indian stock market has fared worst among global peers indian stock market has lost 26 in dollar terms between february 1 and april 9 compared with a decline of 20 and 14 in european and united states markets9
in this strongly connected world the effect of covid19 on international trade is inevitable the outbreak of covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted the bilateral trade relation between india and china china has been the major importers of indian products that include jewelry seafood and pharmaceuticals as far as the total exports of diamond and pharmaceuticals are considered india exports 36 of diamond and 34 of pharmaceuticals to china as the outbreak has primarily disrupted the manufacturing activities in china and other parts of the world united states and europe it is hitting the indian exports significantly due to the restrictions imposed on exports to china it is expected that there could be a fall in the price of petrochemical products in india reports released by chinese official reveal that between january and late february trade between both the countries fell by 124 year on year when the outbreak was spreading in china it had affected the exports and imports in both countries chinas exports to india stood at 671 billion yuan dropped by 126 on year on year basis whereas the imports from india was declined by 116 to 18 billion yuan10 according to unctad estimates the loss occurs to indias trade as a result of covid19 pandemic would stand around us348 million india is among those 15 countries that have been affected severely as the outbreak disrupted manufacturing industries in china and destroyed world trade in case of india the effect of covid19 on trade is estimated to be worst for the chemical sectors with a loss of 129 million dollars whereas the damage has been estimated to be 64 million dollars for textiles and apparel apart from this several other trading companies such as automotive electrical machinery leather products wood and furniture products are likely to be affected by this coronavirus crisis the pandemic is also expected to have affected the domestic fisheries sector as the sector has incurred huge losses with its fall in exports to china the bilateral trade between india and china is also tied by the agricultural products as the agricultural products have been witnessing a negative trend in india it is also hitting the agricultural markets across indopacific region including chinathe main objective of the initial announcement of 21day lockdown followed by its further extension till may 3 has been to ensure social distancing social distancing interventions can be effective against fighting the pandemic but are potentially detrimental to the economy koren  pet 2020 business and corporate companies that depend heavily on the face to face communications or close physical proximity while producing a product or service are particularly vulnerable the idea of social distancing has been proven effective to contain the rapid spread of the epidemics hatchett mecher  lipsitch 2007 markel et al 2007 wildersmith  freedman 2020 many countries across the world have implemented the practice of social distancing by closing down schools prohibiting large community gatherings restricting nonessential stores and transportation in an effort to contain the spread anderson heesterbeek klinkenberg  hollingsworth 2020 thompson serkez  kelley 2020 in this regard questions arise that what are the economic effects of such social distancing previous research has established the efficacy of the implementations of social distancing on reducing the spread of epidemics 1918 spanish flu in the united states bootsma  ferguson 2007 hatchett et al 2007 markel et al 2007 and seasonal viral infections in france adda 2016 are the notable examplesit does not require a trained economist to assess the impact of the complete social and economic lockdown of india on the supply side of the indian economy this lockdown will bring massive disruptions in the production and distributions of goods and services except for the essential commodities in an effort to contain the rapidly spreading coronavirus a fall in social consumption can severely affect the gdp of an economy as people are getting aware about the community transmission of the disease they are maintaining social distancing and cutting back social consumption loss in social consumption is partly considered as a permanent loss however reductions in social consumption may not necessarily amplify all scenarios by the same degree and magnitude this is due to the reason that demand and supply in the market are complementary to each other if closing down the educational institutions and banning public events result in people taking more off from their works then it will create supply shocks in such a situation demand shock will have less scope to do damageasian development bank adb has projected that the outbreak of covid19 might incur economic in indian from 387 million to 299 billion in terms of personal consumption losses in order to assess the economic effect of the outbreak on developing economies in asia adb has categorized four possible scenarios these scenarios are the bestcase scenario moderate case scenario worsecase scenario and hypothetical worstcase scenario under the bestcase scenario it has projected the loss to be 387 million for india if the spread is contained by travel suspension and taking some precautionary measures after 2 months from late january in the occurrence of a moderate scenario the loss is likely to be hit by 640 billion imposing some restrictive policies in place and with the continuation of some precautionary measures for the next 6 months under the worstcase scenario the personal consumption expenditure in india will fall by 12 billionoecd as against the growth predictions made in 2019 now amidst the global uncertainty oecd has revisited the growth forecast in the case of india considering the grave economic situation it has revised the growth by lowering down by 110 basis points to 51 for the financial year 20202021 and subsequently by 80 bps to 56 in 20212022 when it comes to global economic growth oecd has revised down it by 50 bps against the prior projections made in november 2019due to the intensification of the spread and its possible economic consequences on manufacturing and service sector activities fitch has reduced its growth projection from 51 to 49 in 20192020 according to fitch this lower economic growth is driven by domestically weak demand for many consumable items and disruptions in supply chainsafter examining the effect of covid19 on the indian economy and its different sectors this study recommends some policy actions both for the shortrun and long run effective implementation of easy monetary policy by considering a repo cut of 50 basis points and extending the period from 90 to 180 days in recognizing the nonperforming assets npas can provide stimulus to the financial sector corporate social responsibility csr can also play a significant role in mitigating the effect of covid19 spending on pandemic mitigation measures should be a part of csr initiatives to minimize the effect the government should induce more capital to the public sector banks in india micro small and medium enterprises msmes should be given easy and cheap credit as these companies are worst affected by this pandemic the msmes industry provides more than 100 million employment opportunities and contributes 166 to indias gdp post the crisis the employees associated with the sector will experience a decline in their incomes government should provide some incentives to the employees to compensate for the loss that they are facing owing to the lockdown farmers and agriculture migrant workers should be included in the several assistance packages announced by the government and any social protection programs addressing the crisis should include the migrant labors unemployed informal workers should be provided cash income support through jan dhan financial inclusion programgiven the status of indias poor health care system government expenditure on public health care should be substantial to ensure all the required medical facilities to the people india has reported a very low number of coronavirus tests the government should ensure the supply of masks gloves and medical kits to the health workers to contain the virus since the agricultural and allied activities are heavily affected and there has been a fall in aggregate consumption in the country except for the essentials direct benefit transfers to the farmers can improve the demand for agricultural products post the pandemic due importance should be given to research and innovation so that scientist and researchers can find an effective way to address the crisis in addition to public health the government should also help vulnerable households by providing them with temporary direct benefit transfers such actions of the government would support the households to compensate for the loss of their incomes arising out of work shutdowns and layoffs international cooperation and development aid from the developed countries to less developed countries can be proven effective during this crisisthe discussion that has continued since the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome virus and avian influenza epidemics has focused on the potential for immunity among the general population and the moral obligation to treat that is often faced by healthcare professionals and institutions1 2 the current pandemic continues to spread rapidly and there is an ever-growing unease about jump-starting the country the world and the economy again although these are important factors to take into consideration there are some unique challenges faced with the current coronavirus covid-19 that transfigure this conversation into one about responsibilitywith the superfluity of different antibody tests coming into the market with different specificities and sensitivities the word antibody engenders a certain sense of relief or comfort that may not be practical addressing the general population although our understanding of vaccinations and immunity to disease is predicated on the idea of igm antibodies being the first to develop to fight off an infection followed by igg antibodies remaining longer term coronavirus may not be something that can be as easily pre-empted as other illnesses that have vaccines and that generate a similar response with a virus that potentially generates a significant proinflammatory state in a multiorgan system fashion it is hard to understand the potential for immunity the risk with repeat infection the potential for viral mutations and the long-term impact of this situation3 4
in addition to the challenges of immunity the idea of antibodies creates a challenge for understanding the true epidemiological nature of the spread of covid-19 although the majority of public health professionals and institutions understand that antibody testing is not a free pass to restarting the economy the fact that this is primarily an epidemiological study is misunderstood by a majority of the public and can easily be misconstrued to be comparable with immunitygathering epidemiological data about the spread of covid-19 and its potential impacts on different demographics and populations is important4 this information can be used to work to better solutions for segregated minorities and for targeted and widely infected populations the need to understand the pattern of spread is important to allow for better long-term planning on how to manage this pandemic as well as how to manage potential disease in the future when looking from the lens of a bioethicist the potential beneficence to underserved populations as well as the entire global community is immense and unparalleled5 the argument is not whether this potential benefit from a public health outreach containment and understanding is critical for better preventing disease spread but simply if this potential benefit outweighs all the other potential riskseven in the past couple of weeks large cities primarily new york city have seen a large efflux of the wealthy out of the densely populated core6 a recent surge in articles has highlighted the inequity and lack of justice surrounding the antibody testing movement and spread of the disease among the wealthy and the more indigent populations in larger cities this inherently widens the wealth gap that already exists in the usa but even more importantly helps determine where resources should be allocated how hospitals should or should not proceed with cases and where the potential long-term impacts will need more care in the future all these details are not necessarily immediately realised but form a broader public health narrative that can be used to curb such vast discrepancies in the futurein addition to discrepancies seen between disparate populations healthcare workers face a distinct challenge although the idea of antibody testing is great from an epidemiological perspective it sadly offers limited benefit from a medical standpoint the challenge arises particularly in the medical community and exaggerated at the front lines when the discourse surrounding antibody testing remains around the idea of herd immunity and using antibody testing to determine where people work and the extrapolated idea of immunity passportsalthough slightly dystopian in its view the idea of immunity passports is being felt at micromanagement levels as well workers who have had only a minor illness when testing positive for covid-19 or those whose antibody tests return positive and who may have been asymptomatic carriers at one point are designated survivors the notion of survivorship like with patients with cancer is not held in the same regard when antibody testing is mixed with survivorship it offers a shield of protection that blinds many to understanding this disease in its entirety people are suddenly confronted with a moral obligation towards volunteerism in place of the current voluntarismas noted by the hastings center there are many who are falling on either side of the covid-19 antibody debate the potential implications of antibodies and whether they confer immunity are being hotly contested and draw similarities to the great vaccine debate and whether the risks of vaccination outweigh the benefits7 as a society the moral obligation to work towards an idea of herd immunity is natural but fraught with so many uncertainties it is hard to justify parallel discourse with the growing literature and data suggesting the possibility of mutations unequal impacts on different people and the potential repercussions of the spike protein for those with igg immunity already can society in good faith adopt a moral prerogative to put antibody-positive people in the front line or does the uncertainty and possible long-term health consequences mean that these people should be a protected populationethically the central tenets of most of our discussions revolve around the ideas of non-maleficence beneficence justice and autonomy although autonomy is regarded as important but sometimes justifiably sacrificed for the greater good does autonomy and the right to know supersede the potential lack of control and lack of knowledge that antibody testing may confer although the covid-19 pandemic is unique the usa has faced a similar conundrum before in the 1990s when the hiv epidemic was in full throttle and our understanding limited mandatory testing was debated but there were no effective or consistent ways to enforce the difficult logistical and legal problems that arose similarly there are many challenges and potential for stigmatisation that arise with covid-19 testing as wellhealthcare workers form a group of individuals who recognise the potential of covid-19 the impact it has had and are still willing to go to work and continue to face the challenge although morally understandable prudence dictates that healthcare personnel at high risk of exposure regardless of their antibody status take full precautions with every encounter unlike the hiv epidemic covid-19 is aerosolised and spreads not by knowingly taking sexual or intravenous risk but even by unknowingly being exposed if antibody testing had no impact on the daily workings of a hospital department did not change an individuals exposure risk and had no effect on the precautions everyone must take then why take the test is it a risk to the patient simply to take a blood test and confer next to no benefit from this informationthe epidemiological studies that could arise from testing exposed healthcare personnel are enormous the data may show the rate of conversion it may highlight safe practices and help change the way we handle certain situations in the hospital but tracing is incredibly hard with the number of contacts the number of transitions of care and the potential for every exposed surface being considered contaminated the biggest challenge faced by antibody testing may in fact be psychologicalthere is no compendium of information that helps sift through the vast amount of data being collected on covid-19 or even the number of research papers being written on the subject scientific sharing is crucial at this time more than ever before but because of the lag in understanding can we justify the potential cost to those people who are antibody-testedwhen the hiv epidemic was becoming more prevalent the idea of giving antibody testing information to patients was focused on the idea that sharing information would lead to motivating a change in habits8 bad needle practices and recognition of sexual contacts were a feasible and understandable benefit to the potential psychological impact an antibody test would have on an individual9 in the current era a negative test can be deflating but how is this even possible how can a negative test be deflating to a healthcare worker it seems counterintuitive most people would be ecstatic that they did not test positive for antibodies to a potentially lethal virusthe rationally irrational response is expected the higher your risk exposure the higher your contacts and the more isolated one feels the more likely it seems that healthcare personnel think they have had covid-19 or have antibodies although anecdotal many of these personnel are disappointed when they test negative and continue to protect themselves as they had before but knowing that they have not contracted the disease and that the worst may yet still be coming is a feeling that although pervasive in the current climate can weigh on anyone who has to face it daily in addition those who do test positive seem fearless they are the ones willing to go into any room and help out even without an n95 mask on these cavalier feelings particularly among younger physicians who feel that they will likely fight off covid-19 better are simply unsupported by the literature but cavalier actions can lead to a slippery slope of consequencesrecognising these psychological tolls is there any role to testing people to understand the epidemiological risks and not telling people their antibody status this flies in the face of autonomy and mirrors the earlier paternalistic sentiments of medicine in the early 1900s but also allows for more control of information and limits the spread of false predispositions this may not be the perfect answer but these are the two ends of the spectrum somewhere in between will likely be the safest ethical and social decisionin these unusual circumstances where every action is magnified by a certain magnitude by the potential for public health benefits it is important to increase testing the centers for disease control has continued to expound the need to increase our testing capabilities and suggests that our current testing is not nearly where it needs to be10 there is built-up momentum for antibody testing and this will likely have beneficial repercussions regarding opening up businesses potentially helping allocate healthcare resources and focus our research on the best treatment modalities but this is not being realised at this time with the current knowledge of the virus and with the current rate of testing within a week the tests that have been done may be obsolete as the world begins to see reopening as a possibilitythere are really no ethical justifications not to notify patients about their antibody status if they are tested the focus on changing behaviours seen by prior epidemics has transformed during this pandemic it is a moral imperative more than the benefit to the community and public health that those who are tested undergo appropriate counselling because of the inundation of covid-19 stories research and data it is important to temper patients expectations guide them to understanding the ephemeral nature of testing and recognise the potential long-term consequences of this testingsome might hear all of this and say that testing allows for us to be informed and more information is more power but implicitly in this statement is that medicine and healthcare professionals are morally obligated not only to serve their patients and their community but to make sure that they fully understand the ramifications of any test result with limited knowledge about the significance of covid-19 antibody testing at this time it is hard to use this to stratify work in a healthcare setting or to use it for any purpose beyond epidemiological studies on the spread of the diseasethe coronavirus disease covid-19 crisis is now present in china it started in december 2019 and has so far led 213 individuals died and at least 9066 infected in china by local time 1726 january 30 2020 it has also spread to a number of asian countries as well as to canada france germany and the united states as a result the chinese government has put several major cities in hubei province on lockdown and has thrown plans for the lunar new year holiday into chaos for millions of people on january 30 2020 the world health organization also declared the covid-19 outbreak a global health emergency because it could spread to countries that are not preparedfurthermore to prevent the spread of the new and deadly virus all cities in china now have shut down most public places and facilities including parks leaving many people with no place to exercise as a result people may wonder if one should exercise at all during the outbreak and if so how these questions made journal of sport and health science remember some well-known studies done by my colleague dr jeffrey a woods and his team at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign uiuc in which they found a protective effect of exercise on mortality due to influenza in micedr woods is a mottier family professor at uiuc his research focuses on the effects of exercise on the immune system the gut microbiome and aging he was among the first scholars to demonstrate that regular exercise can have an anti-inflammatory effect on the body and showed that exercise can improve the immune response to the flu vaccine in older adults i interviewed dr woods for the should and how questionszhu would you please tell the readers of journal of sport and health science a little bit about yourself for example where did you receive your training and what made you interested in exercise and immune function-related researchwoods i am currently an administrator and researcher at uiuc i received my phd from the university of south carolina usc at columbia under the direction of drs j mark davis and russ pate i had an interest in understanding how exercise affected the immune system because not much was known about it so i sought out co-mentors at the nearby usc school of medicine there i found drs eugene mayer and abdul ghaffar who took me on as an additional mentee to learn about the immune system and how to study it in the 1980s exercise immunology was a very new subfield for exercise science as time evolved it has been satisfying to see how important the immune system is to the normal tissue and organ functioning and pathophysiology and how it plays a role in exercise adaptation in muscle and other tissueszhu please tell us about your well-known exercise and flu studies12 including the purposes of the studies research design and major findingswoods back in the 2000s we performed a series of studies in mice and people to understand how individual bouts of exercise and exercise training affect influenza infection and vaccination respectively in our animal studies we found that moderate endurance exercise 30 minday could protect mice from death due to influenza mice that exercised for longer durations 25 hday exhibited an increase in some illness symptoms but there was no statistically significant difference in mortality when compared to sedentary mice we concluded that moderate exercise could be beneficial and that prolonged exercise could be detrimental to influenza-infected mice for obvious reasons we have not performed this experiment in peoplewe also did a large study to determine whether 10 months of regular endurance exercise could improve influenza vaccination responses in older adults a group that is at risk for infectious disease due to immunosenescence we found that regular moderate cardiovascular exercise could extend the protective effect of the annual influenza vaccination so that it maintained protective levels of antibodies throughout the entire influenza season ie into march and april in the northern hemisphere we concluded that regular moderate endurance exercise might be one way to boost the protective effect of annual influenza vaccination it is very important for all people to receive the annual influenza vaccineboth influenza and coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infection that can lead to morbidity and mortality especially in those who are immunocompromised or who have no existing immunity to the viruses indeed while the covid-19 should not be taken lightly influenza is a much bigger problem but because it is relatively common and has been around for a long time it does not receive the attention that new viral outbreaks do the covid-19 is scary because it is new and we do not know a lot about it yet new viruses are always scary because we have little to no protective immunity against them and we do not have vaccines there is work going on to understand and develop preventive strategies to deal with this covid-19 threat however universal precautions to limit its spread are very important right now until a new vaccine or another strategy is availablezhu based on your earlier studies as well as the progresses made in exercise and immunization over the past 15 years should people exercise during a coronavirus outbreak if so what are the guidelineswoods it is safe to exercise during the coronavirus outbreak one should not limit the multitude of health benefits that exercise provides us on a daily basis just because there is a new virus in our environment however there may be some additional precautions to reduce your risk of infection if you are a social exerciser you might want to limit your exposure to exercise partners who have exhibited signs and symptoms of illness the problem though is that infected people may be infectious before they exhibit symptoms in some instances wearing a mask while exercising may be a way to reduce your exposure it is very important to make sure that if you are exercising on equipment in fitness facilities or gymnasiums that you make sure to disinfect the equipment before and after you use it when done exercising the most effective way to clean hands is to wet them with clean water then apply soap and scrub for at least 20 s before rinsing and drying with a clean towel hand sanitizers with at least 60 alcohol content may also be used but the us centers for disease control and prevention warns they are not effective against all germs this strategy should be used at all times not just because there is an acute viral outbreak avoiding touching your face and neck with your hands is also advised if you cannot disinfect them until a later timeat this stage we know the virus is transmitted through airborne droplets and direct contact with infected people coronaviruses are primarily spread through close contact with another individual in particular through coughing and sneezing on somebody else who is within a range of about 3 to 6 feet from that person we do not know how long the virus remains viable on objectszhu will the guidelines apply to previously sedentary individualswoods it is safe for sedentary individuals to exercise or to start an exercise program physician consultation and approval may be needed for people with disease comorbidity orthopedic problems or advanced age as above there are prudent precautions that can be taken to limit infectious disease spread anything that increases your probability of coming into contact with an infected person or that compromises your immune system increases your risk of infection if you are sedentary it may be a good idea not to overdo it research suggests that unaccustomed strenuous or prolonged exercise might reduce the function of your immune system defenses as such avoiding long and stressful exercise sessions that you are unaccustomed to might be a good ideazhu what about the people who already got infected by flu severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or the current covid-19 in china should they still do exerciseswoods typically one can exercise moderately with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms eg runny nose sinus congestion mild sore throat however i would recommend against exercising if you are experiencing any of these symptoms severe sore throat body aches shortness of breath general fatigue chest cough or fever you should also seek medical care if you are experiencing those symptoms typically recovery from respiratory viral infections takes 23 weeks which corresponds with the time it takes your immune system to generate cytotoxic t cells necessary to clear the virus from infected cells after this period when symptoms are gone it is safe to begin exercising regularly but you may want to take it slow at firstzhu while many research studies examined the impact of a relatively long-term exercise intervention 812 weeks34 others reported that even a single bout of exercise can help boost ones immune function5 so how quickly can one benefit from an exercise boutwoods i believe that even a single exercise bout can be beneficial but regular exercise provides a much bigger benefit molecular and cellular events take place within seconds to minutes following the beginning of an exercise bout or period of physical activity this is why there is so much work right now examining sitting time and how often physical activity should be interspersed with inactivity to promote health the historic thinking has been that exercise promotes a fight or flight stress response that mobilizes immune cells to get ready for impending infectious or noninfectious challenges accompanied by physical activity this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective where physical activity might lead to injury or harmzhu what about intensity it seems that most studies and reviews say that the intensity of the exercises should be kept moderate however campbell and turner6 have recently challenged this belief and claimed that there is no harmful effect on immune function even when a vigorous bout of exercise intervention is employed what is your view on the appropriate intensity of exercise for improving immune functionwoods the report from campbell and turner6 focuses on highly fit individuals who compete in and are accustomed to long endurance high-intensity events while i believe there is merit in the evidence they provide to refute the conclusions for that population studies where sedentary people are forced to exercise at high intensities for prolonged periods might paint a different picture there are few such studies due to the ethics and safety concerns and there are many other variables that contribute to natural infections that would need to be accounted and controlled for in such studies the best studies would be ones that control exercise and infectious disease exposure in people these are difficult to ethically perform in people and it would be very difficult or impossible to get approved by institutional review boards animal models including ours as mentioned may provide valuable insights into this argument and there are many studies demonstrating that prolonged unaccustomed exercise can increase infectious disease morbidity and mortality these studies were not reconciled in the campbell and turner6 article however as with all animal models there are limitations such as species differences stress associated with forced exercise the type of pathogen and timing of exercise in relation to infection that would need to be taken into account before a firm conclusion could be drawnzhu while most published studies have been focused on the impact of aerobic exercise on immune function recent research studies have found resistance training and bodymind exercise such as tai ji quan known also as tai chi and yoga could also be helpful to the immune function what is your view and recommendation on these types of exerciseswoods there have been some more recent studies aimed at determining the role of resistance training and high-intensity interval training on various immune parameters my take of the literature is that there are still very few studies on this to make firm conclusions we published a study in 20077 examining the influence of 5 months of tai ji quanqigong could influence the immune response to influenza vaccination in older adults we found significant increases in the magnitude and duration of antibody responses in tai ji quanqigong participants when compared to controls while i am unaware if these data have been replicated a recent systematic review on the effects of yoga concluded that yoga might be beneficial for those suffering from diseases with an inflammatory component8zhu you have many firsts in the area of exercise and immune function would you please list a few top questions that the field should address so that young researchers can address some of these questionswoods while there has been much progress in understanding the impact of exercise on our immune systems there is still much we do not know and the challenge is that we have known about these questions for some time but limitations of human experimentation and a dearth of good animal models have hindered progress questions such as shown below are key questions for the field to be moving forward1what are the mechanisms whereby exercise affects various aspects of immune functioning2how do various acute and chronic exercise paradigms affect immune system omics measures3does exercise cause epigenetic changes in our immune systems4do exercise-induced changes in immune functioning translate into health benefits5how does exercise impact the gut microbiome and gut immunity6what are optimal exercise dose-responses for various disease stateszhu finally you have been very supportive of chinese scholars and have trained some excellent graduate students from china you have also often reviewed the research works submitted from chinese laboratories based on your observation and experience which areas should the chinese scholars and laboratories further improve and focus onwoods yes i get many inquiries from chinese and other international students about potentially working in my laboratory as a pre-doctoral student the main advice that i would give these students is to make sure that you have a a strong academic record that includes basic science courses ie chemistry physiology b evidence of basic science wet laboratory skills and c tangible research output ie abstracts publications and presentations in your field i would also caution about using cold call e-mails that do not reflect careful thought and research relative to the individual you are contacting you should read the work and understand the research interests of the professor you are contacting while also making a case that you have strong interests and skills in this area most of the chinese scholars i have mentored came to me on recommendation from someone i know and trust eg another us or international professor or student thus it is important to create a network of people in your field of interest you can do this by interacting with people at scientific meetings if that is not an option due to cost or circumstance i would recommend trying to find any connection between you your institution or your current mentor and someone at a target institution of study as for manuscripts coming from chinese or international laboratories submitted to english-language journals my recommendation would be to make sure that the manuscript has been carefully edited for spelling and grammar relative to the english language no matter how good the science is if the presentation is poor it will reflect poorly on the workin the eyes of the general public those with obsessive-compulsive disorder ocd are commonly viewed as germophobic and excessive cleaners who compulsively wash their hands the same behaviors are now encouraged to lower ones risk of infection and the spreading of covid-19 not surprisingly alarming media reports have referred to the current epidemic as a personal nightmare or worst-case scenario for those with ocd collie 2020 kingkade 2020 a recent clinical guide on how to manage ocd under covid-19 echoes similar anxieties suggesting that those with ocd might be more affected than any other group of individuals with a mental illness fineberg van ameringen drummond et al 2020it is a reasonable hypothesis that stress and anxiety as the result of the current pandemic may worsen mental health issues or even cause mental problems issues among those previously unaffected the 2013 sars outbreak had an immediate and longer-term psychological impact among health care workers nickell et al 2004 maunder et al 2014 likewise a significant negative psychological impact is anticipated among the general public given experience from previous pandemics brooks et al 2020 taylor 2019 however the extent to which these effects are particularly relevant to those with ocd is not knownirrational fear of contamination is only one specific manifestation of ocd other common forms of ocd have little direct relationship to viruses and germs including those with harm-related obsessions concerns about symmetry and checking related compulsions even among those with obsessional fears of contamination its not all about viruses and germs but it may also revolve around an entirely different categories of contaminants eg pesticides mold radioactivity chemicals lead asbestos electromagnetic energy and even disinfectants in other words the high level of heterogeneity and selectivity both across and within symptom subtypes is incongruent with the notion that covid-19 is always directly relevant to ocdit is quite possible that the negative effects of the current pandemic will be stronger in some individuals with ocd as a clinician it is not difficult to imagine that those with harm-related obsessions may suddenly start to develop obsessions about infecting others likewise those with contamination fears may have a more difficult time than usual as current events squeeze their way into the obsessional narrative yet even here we have to be careful not to overgeneralizefor example one client with contamination fears was pleasantly surprised to see everyone else engage in the same behaviors as herself she no longer had to feel embarrassed using protective gloves or refusing to shake hands it was a welcome reprieve from the usual stigma self-blame and shame that the disorder tends to bring along however she took protective measures for a different reason than covid-19 she washed her hands because of a fear of acquiring hep c she had no obsessional concerns about the coronavirus in effect she was protected from any negative effects thanks to the high resilience and impermeability of her specific obsessionocd is an extremely slippery disorder immune to generalizations always stubbornly refusing to be boxed into a corner this is also reflected in the aforementioned clinical guide noting difficulties with disentangling normal and abnormal fears of contamination thereby raising concerns on how to deal with symptoms of ocd during the current pandemic fineberg van ameringen drummond et al 2020 on the surface there appears to be a new normal where that what was previously considered exaggerated and abnormal now seems entirely justified and normal indeed when do irrational fears of contamination start to diverge from entirely normal and rational fears what is it exactly that makes an entirely justified fear of contagion different from obsessional fears of contaminationthe current communication will address these questions through a consideration of recent developments in research on feared-self perceptions in ocd aardema  wong 2020 first it will be shown that the personalized meaning attached to viruses and germs including the personification of viruses as entities that possess human-like characteristics allows for a positioning towards these life forms that enable them to not only threaten the physical body but also the self second it will be argued that a fear of contamination becomes obsessional due to a fear of inner corruption where compulsions serve to safeguard the self rather than just the body third the differences between normal and abnormal fears of contamination will be illustrated through the specific manner that ocd clinically manifests itself in comparison to normal and even exaggerated non-obsessional fears of contagion finally the paper concludes with some clinical recommendations for psychoeducation and specific cognitive interventions during treatment for ocd in the context of the current pandemicas pointed out by schlozman 2014 on any objective level viruses and germs are interpersonally boring they do not have any personality or volition they just are what they are microscopic entities that do whatever they do sometimes causing disease and death none of these characteristics are likely to cause ocd if they did then most infectious disease specialists would suffer from this disorder and apart from seeing the value of frequent handwashing sneezing in your elbow and not touching your face there is no evidence they are more likely to suffer from ocd than anyone else yet the meaning we can attach to these life forms is quite different in our imagination they can be like monsters out to get us and even though the bogey man did not get you today it might always do so tomorrow schlozman 2014we all tend to personify viruses and germs early on the chinese president xi labelled the coronavirus a devil virus as if it were a malevolent entity out to get us with the intent to wipe out humanity blanchard 2020 likewise other politicians and decision makers have referred to the coronavirus as the invisible enemy or the hidden enemy while simultaneously developing battle plans and going to war to fight an enemy that is unable to return the same sentiment serhan 2020the current coronavirus has also been ascribed local identity and nationality as the wuhan virus and the chinese virus the naming of viruses after their place of origin has occurred throughout history in the personification of viruses eg middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus although more recently formally abandoned because of unnecessary stigmatizing effects on nations and its people world health organization 2015 yet these names continue to be used even though viruses and germs do not have a nationality nor do they carry any passports it gives them a lot more identity than they deserve which incidentally is a phrasing that inadvertently gives them identity as wellit is quite difficult to talk about germs and viruses without simultaneously implying they have sentience volition and personality it is not unique to those with ocd alone and occurs throughout the general population in many situations it seems relatively harmless like in childrens cartoons that show naughty delinquent germs running across the screen being chased by heroic white blood cells although the personification of viruses and germs has been found to be associated with heightened fears of contamination among non-clinical controls riskind  richards 2018 it is unlikely to play any direct causal role in ocd nor would a tendency to personify viruses and germs be necessarily expected to differentiate between normal and obsessional fears of contamination however the personification of viruses and germs illustrates how these life forms are not only a physical threat but can also represent a psychological threat as an enemy or invader able to threaten the self connelly and macleod 2004 indeed the wider literature suggests that those with ocd might be particularly vulnerable to experience viruses and germs as a psychological threat due to an already fragile and incoherent identity aardema  wong 2020 this brings us to a historical fear of inner corruption among those with ocdin a recent historical analysis of obsessions aardema and wong 2020 observe that while fears of contagion and disease have always existed a fear of viruses and germs did not exist until the end of the 19th century until germ theory became more widely accepted as a scientific account on the spread of disease before this time ideas on the origin of disease were not as established either viewed as the result of evil influences or considered to spread through bad air from decaying organic matter in addition views on what constituted a contaminant was quite different in earlier times prior to the 17th century historical records that describe obsessive-compulsive fears of contamination are scarce to non-existent instead earlier accounts more commonly describe a fear of inner corruption as the result of evil influences luibheid  russell 1982 p 212 kempe 14362015 and later on in theological doctrines derived from the notion of original sin bunyan 1666 as well as secular notions of inner corruption as the devil that exists inside all of us mcadams 1993 in other words the historical evolution of ocd suggests that a fear of mental contamination might be more central to an understanding of this disorder than fears of physical contamination that is in the obsessional case physically oriented forms of contamination represent a historical continuation of a fear of inner corruption through other meansgerm theory while providing a scientific objective account of disease has never completely succeeded in depersonalizing the origins of disease in the eyes of the general public allowing microscopic life to not only threaten the physical body but personal identity as well in lessons learned from the 2014 ebola outbreak schlozman 2014 observed the following on the true insidious danger of infectionwe personify an illness and then we attribute the personality of the illness to those who are unlucky enough to have the disease the infected individuals go from being unique person to simply persons with ebolathe disease which we have personified becomes the person himself and the person therefore loses his personhood
the personification of disease including the viruses and germs that cause them allows these life forms to not only threaten the physical body but also to threaten and psychologically pollute the self this issue is particularly germane to ocd which has been proposed to be characterized by feared self-perceptions driving their symptoms both with regards to the occurrence of repugnant obsessions and more recently obsessional fears of contamination aardema  oconnor 2007 aardema wong audet melli  baraby 2018 the specific traits and self-related qualities feared by those with ocd are varied and diverse but a fear of inner corruption is a common theme throughout the historical clinical and empirical literature on ocd aardema  wong 2020in particular the seminal work of rachman 1994 has highlighted constructs closely related to a fear of inner corruption especially in relation to the notions of pollution of the mind and mental contamination representing a sense of inner dirtiness arising from sources other than visible physical contaminants radomksy coughtrey sahfran rachman 2017 in other words in the case of obsessional fears of contamination it may not really be about any of the objective characteristics of viruses and germs but instead how these personified life forms desecrate and violate ones own self and personhood not dissimilar from feelings of contamination that may arise following imagined or actual violation fairbrother  rachman 2004 elliott  radomsky 2012indeed despite the allowances provided by germ theory for an objective fear of microscopic life early accounts of germaphobia do not always clearly identify a genuine fear of viruses or germs or even any specific disease resulting from it but instead they appear to describe an intangible fear revolving around the desecration and violation of the self hammond 1883 as cited in aardema and wong 2020i have no particular apprehension of contracting small-pox or any other disease i can specify it is an overpowering feeling that i shall be defiled in some mysterious way that presses me with a force i cannot resista subtle influence whatever it may be that is capable of passing through my gloves to my hands
those with fears of physical contamination are often unable to exactly describe what they might be contaminated with nor do they necessarily express any obvious concerns with the consequences of contracting viruses and germs like death or disease this difficulty with expressing fears in concrete terms is consistent with the notion of feelings of contamination arising from a fear of inner corruption and the perceived violation of the embodied self it may also help to explain the ego-dystonic nature of obsessions where the person is able to intellectually recognize that the objective characteristics and consequences of germs and viruses form no realistic basis for their fears yet at the same unable to distance from the intense feelings of contamination that arises from their association with the psychological underlying theme of inner corruptionrecent evidence supports the notion that concerns about physical or contact contamination resulting in washing behaviors is closely intertwined with feelings of mental contamination or pollution that arises from a fear of ones own identity being tainted or corrupted krause wong giraldo-omeara aardema  radomksy 2020 in addition improvements in feared self-perceptions during psychological treatment is significantly associated with lessened concerns about physical contamination aardema wong audet melli  baraby 2018 this suggests that an obsessional fear of germs and viruses is something entirely different than any normal fears and washing behaviors that arise due to a pandemic it is not even the same as an exaggerated fear of contamination phobic-like responses to a pandemic due to overestimating the probability of danger likely exists but these tendencies are not unique to ocd and are present in a variety of anxiety disorders tolin worhunsky  matlby 2004 instead what makes a fear of contamination truly obsessional is when this threat becomes personal not solely in terms of its potential objective outcomes but how it is perceived to corrupt and taint the self via the psychological meaning attached to contracting viruses and germsocd is unique in comparison to other disorders characterized by high levels of anxiety yet at the same time is able to masquerade as a normal fear and even as a phobic aversion this makes it easy to assume those with ocd will be particularly affected by the current pandemic as the result of a catastrophic or exaggerated reaction similar to those with a phobia however ocd is not a phobiathe early work of oconnor  robillard 1995 reports several inconsistencies in the notion of a parallel between phobic aversion and ocd the first inconsistency is that ocd is highly selective within a particular category of feared objects and substances where for example a person checks for the presence of pieces of paper near a radiator for fear of fire yet is unconcerned whether or not the stove is left on those with phobia do not show the same degree of selectivity fears revolve around a consistent objectively quantifiable category of objects or situations where they avoid all spiders or all heights or all planes in contrast obsessional fears are highly idiosyncratic and domain-specific with variations within even specific subdomains of any particular subtype like the case of the client who feared the hep c virus but showed no heightened concerns about the coronavirus this high level of selectivity can even have a protective effect against the negative effects of a pandemic as compared to other disorders that are characterized by a more generalized tendency to overestimate threatthe second inconsistency is that in ocd the selective categorization of aversive stimuli is in association with another theme where for example dirt is only classified as dirt if associated with any particular person obsessional fears are conditional on the idiosyncratic meaning attached to feared objects substances or events above and beyond the objective and visible features of an object or event hence on the surface it may appear that those with ocd fear dirt viruses and germs but it is really about what these represent or symbolize especially in relation to an underlying feared self-theme that allows them to threaten the self beyond any potential objective effects like disease or deaththird those with ocd often do not pay any attention to reality and may not even be able to report what they try to accomplish by washing or cleaning they do not necessarily know what a virus or germ looks like anymore than a regular person while those with a simple phobia know exactly what they fear while threat itself is almost always a concern in ocd this relates to how the aversive stimulus is perceived to threaten the underlying self-theme consequently the function of washing behaviors among those with ocd is entirely different from any normal or even exaggerated reactions to the current pandemic first and foremost they are carried out to safeguard and protect against dangers to the self as opposed to the physical bodyfinally obsessional fears are the result of a running narrative that is grounded in the imagination as opposed to reality those with ocd are not actually acting upon the demands of the real world when engaging in rituals and compulsive behaviors the person with ocd may act as if or even believe that they are acting upon reality when they fear contagion but they are really acting upon their own imagination the symbolic nature of their fear is confused with reality in a failure to fully appreciate the imaginary origin of obsessional fears it is for the same reason that obsessional concerns typically arise in inappropriate contexts that are not directly related to events and situations occurring in the here and nowthe out-of-context occurrence of obsessions has recently found empirical support in a recent experimental task that found intrusions occurring without evidence significantly predict symptoms of ocd audet wong radomksy  aardema 2020 in contrast intrusions occurring with evidence did not predict symptoms even though these were associated with higher levels of distress in other words obsessional fears arise without there being any direct evidence for risk of infection for example a fear of a virus finding its way through the walls as opposed to feelings of discomfort when someone walks up to you to shake your hands in the middle of a pandemic in the case of the latter someone with obsessional fears of contamination will obviously experience anxiety but this reaction does not necessarily indicate ocd the thought about being contaminated would be an entirely normal intrusive thought even when it occurs to someone with obsessional fears of contamination in other words a truly obsessional reaction occurs not on the basis of direct evidence pertinent to the here and now but as the result of an overreliance on the imagination that takes real objects events and facts out of context due to its association with the vulnerable self-theme of inner corruptionrecent clinical guidelines on how to manage ocd under covid-19 advise to pause or adapt ongoing cognitive-behavioral therapy during the current pandemic at least for those with fears of contamination these guidelines note how the difference between normal and abnormal fears of contamination can be difficult to tell and given potential risks to clients with engaging in exposure and response prevention erp pharmacotherapy is proposed as a first option for clients with contamination fears however the unique features of ocd make a different set of recommendations possible in particular there are evidence-based cognitive approaches that align strongly with a cognitive formulation of fears of contamination as outlined in the current paper oconnor aardema  pelissier 2005 julien oconnor  aardema 2016first and foremost it would advise that therapists engage in psychoeducational efforts that highlight the difference between normal and obsessional fears of contamination learning how to tell the difference between normal and obsessional doubts is already an intrinsic part of inference-based cognitive therapy for ocd oconnor  aardema 2012 it teaches those with ocd that obsessions typically occur out-of-context and without any direct evidence justifying the doubt specific examples in line with recent events can be provided that illustrate the differences between normal and obsessional fears of contamination for example an urge to wash ones hands following grocery deliveries or after physically bumping into another person in the street is entirely justified in the context of the current pandemic it is a concern that occurs in-context with direct evidence for potential contamination and aligns with the facts about possible contamination next examples can be provided highlighting the unique features of obsessional concerns but applied to a situation that is neutral to the clientfor example in the case of the client with highly specific fears of acquiring the hep-c virus a parallel was drawn with covid-19 referring to one of the many possible scenarios that the client believed might result in acquiring hep-c the proposed obsessional scenario by which she might acquire covid-19 included someone walking by in front of the house who looked pretty old might perhaps live in residency for the elderly with other contaminated individuals may have touched things outside of the house which then could have been somehow brought into the house by the children resulting in the entire family being infected when applied in this manner clients are usually readily able to recognize the imaginary nature of the reasoning while also realizing that they justify their own fears in a similar manner thereby reducing the credibility of their own obsession in the words of the clientin a way i can see how all these covid fears invalidate my concerns about hep c it makes sense people take measures to protect themselves from covid there is real evidence to be concerned about covid but with hep c there is nothing like that theres no epidemic it does not spread easily and i have no specific risk for getting it its a fine line between reality and imagination and yet for some reason it does not cross over into covid-19 when i see people walking less than 6 feet away from me my ocd does not latch onto that it does seem like this covid thing puts the ocd in context it makes me ask myself do i really need to wash my hands for hep c
it deserves to be noted that this client had already significantly improved as the result of cognitive therapy and psychoeducation efforts can be more challenging earlier in treatment however none of this retracts from the message that cognitive interventions can be successfully utilized in treatment during the current pandemic to illustrate the falsehood of obsessions alongside with other cognitive techniques and interventions that aim to reduce the credibility of the obsession oconnor  robillard 1999 oconnor koszegi aardema van niekerk  taillon 2009 in addition cognitive interventions addressing the underlying vulnerable self-themes have been successfully incorporated into an inference-based approach to ocd aardema  oconnor 2007while inference-based cognitive therapy does not include exposure it is an approach that has been successfully combined with erp van niekerk brown aardema  oconnor 2014 the current pandemic has raised specific concerns about erp where exposure exercises might put patients at risk indeed in the context of the current pandemic some forms of exposure for fears of contamination go against social distancing guidelines and might reasonably be expected to increase ones risk of contagion if not followed yet an inference-based perspective would expect less problems in the administration of erp if exposure exercises align themselves fully with the differences between normal and abnormal fears of contamination as outlined in the current paper that is since obsessional fears are irrational fears of contamination that occur out-of-context and without any direct evidence there should be no risks in exposing individuals to situations where this applies this is not exposure with safety behaviors included but exposure that more specifically target the unique characteristics of obsessional fears after all the whole point of exposure is to relieve those with ocd from fears that occur in unrealistic situations not to get rid of adaptive fears and expose them to risksocial distancing measures might make devising exposure exercises more difficult but those with obsessional fears of contamination are quite capable of fearing situations without any actual risk or physical contact so there should be plenty of opportunities for exposure that are safe for the patient to perform erp does not necessarily need to include putting ones hand in the toilet or hugging random people on the street the differences between normal and obsessional fears of contamination outlined in the current paper may help to assist with devising appropriate exposure exercises one might even hypothesize that targeted exposure exercises that are based on the differences between normal and abnormal contamination will be more effective than those that haphazardly target contamination in an exaggerated manner although this is an empirical question that requires further testingthe current paper has explored fears of contamination in the context of the current pandemic drawing upon the historical and recent empirical literature emphasizing the role of feared-self-perceptions and in particular a fear of inner corruption giving rise to obsessions it proposes that obsessional fears of contamination can be explained by the interaction between the psychological meaning attached to contracting viruses and germs the specific feared qualities that the person most fears acquiring and the ensuing imagined effect of corrupting the self it is not the objective features of viruses and germs that underlie obsessional fears nor is it an exaggerated fear but rather how these life forms threaten the self consequently those with ocd are never right about washing their hands in response to an obsession in effect they are trying to remove dirt that is not really therewhile the current communication is based on recent empirical evidence on the role of feared self-perceptions in ocd there is a need for both cross-sectional and experimental research to test some of the ideas and predictions derived from the current conceptualization the model would predict that a fear of of inner corruption and the specific qualities and traits they fear acquiring is closely aligned with the negative qualities and psychological meaning ascribed to contracting contaminants like viruses and germs resulting in the occurrence of out-of-context obsessions and compulsive urges to wash and clean to preserve a normal unblemished sense of self in addition in line with recent findings it would predict that therapy specifically targeting a fear of inner corruption results in reduced physical contamination fears mediated by reductions in mental contamination aardema wong audet melli  baraby 2018 krause wong giraldo-omeara aardema  radomksy 2020the potential effects of the current pandemic on mental health should not be underestimated the current paper does not deny that current concerns and anxieties about covid-19 may cause contribute to or worsen symptoms in individuals however this effect may not be as specific to ocd as assumed since it is not just a heightened concern about danger that characterizes this disorder but rather whether or not threats are associated with an underlying vulnerable self-theme in some individuals with ocd recent events might be incorporated or strengthen obsessional narratives leading up to obsessional fears of contamination and contagion but these can never form any real justification for the reality of an obsession that arises from the imagination for any specific obsessional effect to occur a fear of viruses and germs has to hit the persons vulnerable self-theme and the extent to which it is able to do so remains to be seen for the same reason therapy addressing feared self-perceptions might be particularly beneficial for those with obsessional fears of contaminationthe author is a recipient of a senior research scholar award from the quebec health research fund fonds de la recherche en sant du qubec the author is also the principal investigator on a grant no 156303 from the canadian institutes of health research cihr investigating the effectiveness of exposure in vivo

maunder et al 2003 nickell et al o connor 2002 radomksy et al 2018the current special issue article was assigned to an independent editor for review the author has no conflicts of interest to declarethe world is experiencing a major pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 the coronavirus causing covid-19 this disease first entered the human population in hubei province china in mid-november 2019 and manifested in wuhan the largest metropolitan area of hubei when a cluster of patients were admitted to hospital with a severe pneumonia of unknown cause in early december although humanity has survived previous pandemics by infectious agents the present one is unprecedented in its capacity to take advantage of modern globalization allowing for massive transborder spread at a surprising speedwhen writing these lines the pandemic affects 181 countries and territories with around 1084000 infected subjects more than 58000 deaths and 225000 recovered patients according to the johns hopkins university 1the sars-cov-2 virus is optimized to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 using the viruses spike protein ace2 is a membrane-associated and secreted enzyme expressed predominantly on endothelium 2 but also present in cells of the alveolus enteric cells and in epithelial cells of the oral mucosa 3 the capacity of this virus to develop and replicate in the oral mucosa and thus in the upper parts of the respiratory system allows for easy transmission similar to flu viruses this upper respiratory involvement and high viremia at the beginning of the infection allows for transmission to other subjects even before the appearance of symptoms which additionally to subjects showing a very mild clinical picture poses a great epidemiological problem which also happens with influenza viruses 4 of asymptomaticpresymptomatic carriers the difficulties in detecting asymptomatic carriers who often do not know they are infected undoubtedly facilitates the spread and appearance of unexpected disease foci whose traceability becomes impossible in several cases 5moreover sars-cov-2 shares characteristics well known in other animal coronaviruses among them its capacity to survive for several days outside the hosts body helps explain how sars-cov-2 spreads by contact 6 although of an undoubtedly lower epidemiological role this capacity indicates a significant difference from flu viruses this is important when considering the additional faecal shedding of this virus 7 although the impact of climate characteristics typical of the end of spring and summer eg high temperatures longer uv radiation in the longer days and a lower environmental humidity causes interruption of the transmission of flu viruses and underlie their seasonality climatic changes are not likely to have a great impact on covid-19 transmission dynamics as evident by its already logarithmic spread in countries with warmer climates the very high temperatures experienced in many countries of the northern hemisphere linked to the climate change phenomenon in recent years eg temperatures higher than 40 c could have a negative impact on the transmission capacity of the virus although for the aforementioned reasons those factors alone are unlikely to alter the level of transmissionwhen considering that we are still without specific clinical treatments useful antivirals and vaccines and other technologies to fight the virus and that the successful development and deployment of such advances are many months away there is no other way to face the very fast spread of this disease than using the old methods of isolation of infected subjects and quarantines of populations towns and cities extending restrictions to whole countries 17 ideally these measures are coupled with diagnostic detection isolation and treatment of all clusters of infection contact tracing is as important as simple isolation there is simply no time to waste at the present level of the epidemicanother question arises concerning the capacity to modulate the epidemic curve in western democratic countries and in islamic countries a priori the relatively fast success of china in controlling the disease does not seem to be something we can extrapolate outside of china differences in the capacities of political regimes to impose restrictions on the one hand and personal ideologies traditions and ways of life on the other hand suggest that it is unlikely for countries to be able to reach chinas success at such a speed anyway the way in which south korea succeeded with its emphasis on testing treating and isolating all cases coupled with testing and isolating all close contacts of covid-19 persons provides provides optimismunfortunately data on the numbers of infected people in several countries including those with very numerous populations do not appear credible differences in methodology and coverage in the implementation of diagnostic tests are undoubtedly furnishing biased pictures which do not allow for significant country comparisons nor a present global analysis or for an optimal global strategy in that sense the recent call by who to increase diagnostic test application goes in the right direction although the capacity of many of the countries seems to fall below this aspirationviral genome analyses of sars-cov-2 reveal a very slow mutation rate along its spread although this would help facilitate the development of efficient vaccines vaccine development for a virus that has antibody-mediated enhancement is tricky thus a vaccine to impede sars-cov-2s ability to become seasonal or to reduce its seasonal impact is challenging recent work on the evolution of sars-cov-2 using computational analyses strongly indicate that natural selection within a human or human-like ace2 receptor permitted alteration to the most variable part of the coronavirus genome namely the receptor binding domain rbd of the spike protein allowing optimal binding to the human ace2 to arise 8 this shift in rbd led to its current easy spread among and within humans mutation of the sars-cov-2 genome relating to pathogenicity are less variable thus it does not seem likely for this virus to readily become less pathogenic to humans in the near future as happened with other previously emerging viruses eg swine influenza this adds to the question of immunization will recovered subjects keep an effective immune status and if yes for how longmore seriously is the question of whether a previous infection with sars-cov-2 could expose the individual to more serious disease when confronted by an altered form of sars-cov-2 in the manner that dengue virus does thus underlining the question of how the characteristic of antibody-enhanced infection of sars-cov-2 and of other coronavirus challenges not only the notion of immunity from having been infected but the development of a safe and effective vaccine in china and elsewhere in the world most of the population is still susceptible because to date there is no proven previous contact with the virus this raises many serious questions regarding the threat of subsequent waves of infectionit is evident that everyone is learning from the present situation with this one health disease 1718 from clinicians to virologists epidemiologists veterinarians scientists of all kinds and even economists psychologists politicians and a wide spectrum of other professionals but the reaction of governments decision makers supranational institutions and international agencies merits an extra analysisevidence indicates a zoonotic origin which reminds us of the origin of the avian influenza or bird flu pandemic by h5n1 similarly first detected in guangdong province in china in 1996 91718 it is evident that after what has happened with covid-19 and its social impact and future economic repercussions china and other nations where citizens frequently have close contact with wild animals will need to implement strict control measures to avoid a similar pandemic to appear in their territory again china has an immense international commerce reflected in its exchange of people and products with almost all countries and therefore its public health measures or lack thereof can have great consequences for all nationsin developed countries of the northern hemisphere it is hard to understand why supranational agencies and expert institutions did not understand the magnitude of the risk posed by such a singular virus nor of its capacity to take advantage of globalization with an astonishingly rapid worldwide spread indeed the crucial characteristics of covid-19 lie in its transmission pathways existence of asymptomaticpresymptomatic carriers and survival potential in the external environment which were already explained and transmitted to the world by the chinese colleagues since mid-january so many scientific publications during the last two decades about the capacity of globalization to facilitate the spread of infectious agents seem to have been ignored worldwide spread of viruses following different transmission ways as hiv virus ebola virus aedes mosquito-borne viruses as those of zika chikungunya and dengue yearly vaccine problems posed by the quick mutating seasonal flu viruses seem to have been useless models now in comparison to the very fast spreading new virus how is it that in early january after the recognition that this virus was incubating in china no leaders seriously considered high risk of an accelerated rate of disease spread posed when chinese people returned to other countries from their visits to china for the celebration of chinese new yearfor covid-19 we learned early on that there are marked differences in pathogenicity based on age groups with a pronouncedly higher mortality from the age of 60 it is difficult to understand that no developed country prioritized control measures to be applied to aged peoples residences many deaths could have been avoided was no one in these agencies analyzing age-dependent datainitial inaction subsequent slow reaction 10 and lack of consensus agreements memorandums of understanding by neighbouring countries despite repeated warnings by who suggest that the role of agencies put in place in the past precisely to prevent situations such as the present one will need to be re-analyzed the deceptive presentation of countries within the european union each acting as if each were working alone unavoidably poses the question about the usefulness of having a european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc stockholm it seems inevitable to conclude that this agency failed in passing the correct message and failed to make the needed timely efforts to convince the leaders of european countries surprisingly the us suffered from similar mistakes as the european countries including a pronounced delay in creating tests and in its inexplicable descensions to produce testing criteria that obscured community spread coupled with a heavy reluctance by the us cdc and us governmental officials to change the testing criteria significantly until mid-march and the dearth of equipment including lack of needed personal protective equipment including surgical masks and facemasks 11 and insufficient quantities of mechanical ventilators for the patients and lack of surgical capacity for hospital beds and icu space much of this reflected the reduction of the strategic national stockpile which had been built up throughout the usa in the beginning of this century and slowly degraded to only two locations maryland and california plus the reduction of the global health and security unit a unit responsible for pandemic preparedness in the white house national security staff 12 the loss of the once robust strategic national stockpile for a minimal stockpile is particularly lamentable in light of the reality that in the absence of specific treatments non-pharmacologic approaches rely on supportive therapies with oxygen and ventilatory support and other equipment coupled with needed ppe that once formed a large part of that strategic national stockpile were no longer readily available nationwide too often governments focus their defense primarily against other nations and other ideological human actors world leaders forget that mother nature is the most potent bringer of doom from massive cyclones destructive wildfires to horrific pandemicslessons from all this should be learned and appropriate corrections implemented in the near future once the present picture begins to clearthe short-term scenarios of the present situation pose many questions china is now suffering from the boomerang of the pandemic and is obliged to recreate barriers to avoid the re-entry of covid-19 to its territory after they detected the reintroduction by travelers coming from outside of china in a country with such a massive population where the vast majority still has not experienced covid-19 and thus has no previous immunological contact with this virus the risk of a second wave is very highin europe and north america no country has yet reached the peak of the epidemiological curve and there is a great disagreement in the mathematical models being used one important aspect appears obvious the successful experience of china in its rapid control of the outbreak cannot be easily extrapolated to occidental democracies where individual freedom is a largely internalized concept nor do leaders outside of china have the capacity to impose these measures at the level of the chinese regime 13 what will happen in countries of the indian sub-continent the middle-east and south america where crowded living is traditional mass gatherings are usual and the national health systems are far from sufficient also remains an open question the possibility of the appearance of subsequent secondary peaks cannot not be underestimatedwe should also take great interest in analyzing the thus far incomprehensible and considerable differences in mortality rates between different countries eg china-italy and between different areas inside the same country lombardia compared to its neighbouring areas inside italy none of the explanations so far proposed clarify thisin the mid-term the subsequent scenario in the southern hemisphere must be considered nearly all south american caribbean and african countries have limited national health systems with insufficient capacity to prevent spread of covid-19 and to mitigate death and disabilities several of these nations quickly decided to close frontiers although generally too late as they already had the disease inside all indications reveal that the southern hemisphere will not escape from the massive problems of this disease a worrying scenario for their immediate future the problem is coupled to the question of the extent to which developed countries will manifest the will and the capacity to help low and middle countries the outbreak in the southern hemisphere is flaring now and this is happening while the higher income nations are still struggling over their own issues in i implementing control measures ii trying to recover from the immense social and economic impacts and iii concentrating in impeding re-entry of the virus by foreigners nations everywhere must recognize that in this era of massive global exchange of persons and goods leaving the outbreaks soring anywhere posses a risk everywherethe potential long-tern scenario of likely secondary waves of infection is also concerning a second wave may be more devastating than the first one as happened in other pandemics in history several factors must be considered i once the peak of the epidemiological curve is reached there will still be many people who are not exposed to the virus and ii we still do not know whether covid-19 infection furnishes a protective immunization status or worsens the outcome of second infection nor do we know anything about the length of such an immunological responsethe fast speed of this pandemic and the unavoidable time needed to discover and develop useful medications antivirals and vaccines advocates strongly for the urgency of quickly implemented public health measures of hygiene respiratory hand and environmental case detection with proper case management and isolation coupled with social isolation and population quarantines of a duration which may differ according to the objectives such as buying time to i avoid the collapse of local health systems ii for the discovery of useful treatments antivirals and vaccines dealing with a potential antibody enhanced infection as with sars may pose difficulties in getting a vaccine and iii have sufficient capacity in terms of icu beds ventilators and other equipment needed to save livesbesides health professionals on the frontline we need psychologists to help people adapt to the confinement measures economists to analyze economic consequences as well as scientists research develop and analyze for safety and efficacy useful treatments antivirals and vaccines and epidemiologists to analyze the quickly changing epidemiological data as well as other engineers and others to innovate solutions all of this is not only crucial but urgent 1417 regarding epidemiological data it is evident that data on infected subjects from the different countries are only indicative but cannot be compared diagnostic test application ie test availability and number of health personnel for sample taking and analysis differs markedly between countries this does not mean however that these data are not internally useful for a country to follow their epidemiological curve and evaluate the success of their control measures appliedthe recent preliminary results of the observational studies of infected and control patients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and an antibiotic drug with previously demonstrated action against zika and ebola viruses azithromycin are promising despite the limitations of a small sample size short-term outcome follow-up and lack of positive response by 10 of the infected subjects this appears to be one of the first antiviral drug combination to show serious promise as a cure to covid-19 and to limit the transmission of the virus to other people in order to curb the spread of covid-19 worldwide 15 another combination with promise is hydroxychloroquine with remdesivir more recently the mechanisms of antiviral effect the risk-benefit ratio and the thresholds of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have been reviewed and attention has been drawn to the need for high-quality evaluation protocols of the potential beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine as a post-exposure drug for people exposed to sars-cov-2 infection ie people with close contact with positive tested patients including home and medical caregivers 19additionally scientists public health experts doctors and experts in infectious diseases should advise governors and other decision makers and be ready to answer requests from the different media our expert role is crucial now in transmitting the appropriate information to the peoplewe must be very careful in measuring the words we use to avoid misunderstandings a good example was the initial insistence by governments to downplay the outbreak of the disease thus when it became plain that the spread of the disease in their countries could be significant and could produce severe even deadly disease and that strict measures implying individual freedom restrictions should be implemented a wave of criticism and disbelief immediately followed because people did not understand this changeanother example has been the continuous reference to flu to help people understand the transmission and the clinical characteristics of the disease the consequence has been that people immediately considering though that covid-19 was not so serious thus complicating subsequent efforts to help people and even decision makers understand that covid-19 is not a fluthe way of referring to age-group dependent pathogenicity and mortality also led the youth to think this disease was not relevant to them which led to massive problems in convincing the youth of their responsibilities in following isolation measures and hygienic standardsthe next problem is to help people understand that reaching the descending arm of the epidemiological curve does not necessarily mean the end of the local epidemic and that it does not exclude the possibility for further peaks to appear the temporality concept is not easy to explain though models exist thus no one knows how long it will take to reach the descending arm of the epidemic in each area and whether in neighbouring areas it will follow the same patternmost branches of the media are not accustomed to interviewing scientists and similarly many scientists are not used to explaining their science in laymans terms scientists must adapt their messages so as to convey the information in a way that laymen can understand we must recognize that most of the lay audience has virtually no serious background knowledge about health infectious diseases or epidemiology the task may be very difficult but it is also vital we must be available and we must communicate otherwise the media will call on non-expert people who are likely to provide misleading information the risk from the dissemination of inappropriate information is obvious even more at a time where people confined to their homes dedicate significant amounts of time to obtain information through the different mediaeconomists are logically highly concerned about the economic impact of control measures and go on giving priority to the economic side of the crisis even though plenty of models existed that show the economic impacts of the disease most economists are challenged by the social and economic depth of the covid-19 pandemic they are struggling to understand that better control soonest though of apparent great in economic losses can ultimately lead to much less total economic loss and to faster recovery they have not yet grasped that prolonging the outbreak causes far more economic damage than that of taking drastic measures to end the pandemic globally as soon as possible similarly many governmental leaders have difficulties in changing their political chip after decades of repeating respective party prioritiesthere is an important role for the scientific societies in domains related to the present pandemic national societies are a good tool to channel appropriate advise up to government decision makerswe know that globalization and climate change are giving rise to new scenarios in which new infectious agents have more opportunities to originate and similarly can facilitate spread of already existing agents which take the advantage to enhance their geographical spread and can perhaps lead to worse pandemics than the present one 16 a message to the people is needed to help all persons understand that this changing world unavoidably implies higher probabilities for such situations and that wide research results suggest that other epidemics or pandemics may appear in the future and to plan for and maintain trained persons with appropriate access to needed equipment and supplies and an easily expanded surg capacity understanding the lessons of this pandemic and incorporating those lessons at all levels should lead us towards improving our preparedness in all sectors to mitigate risks from the inevitable next pandemicpathogen x the hypothetical unknown potentially devastating microorganism capable of causing a major pandemic friedrich 2018 now has a name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 despite warnings and preparedness efforts by who and other health agencies the rapid spread of covid-19 which in less than 4 months has moved from affecting a few persons in wuhan hubei province china to more than 5 million people in almost every country in the world coronavirus research center httpscoronavirusjhuedumaphtml visited on may 21th 2020 has caught by surprise most governments and public health systems the result cannot be evaluated yet but the over 300000 officially recognized deaths and the economic social and political distresses caused by this epidemic will certainly impact our world in the coming months probably years in light of the wave of disinformation and mistrust by wide sectors in the public towards experts and scientists views on how to stop this pandemic we feel the need to bring a scientific perspective on the source causes uses and possible ways to halt the spread of this new coronavirus from a basic science perspective that marking the core nature of this journal blending genetics virology epidemiology and evolutionary biology population genetics and population biology what did they bring to the

of china zhu et al 2020 after sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus to emerge and spread in human populations phylogenetic analyses showed that as sars-cov sars-cov-2 is a member of the sarbecovirus subgenus genus betacoronavirus zhou et al 2020b recently the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv indicated that sars-cov-2 is to be classified within the species severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus coronaviridae study group of the ictv 2020 mers-cov subgenus merbecovirus is more distantly related to sars-cov-2 than sars-covin the aftermath of the sars and mers epidemics intense efforts were devoted to identify the animal reservoirs of these viruses and to reconstruct the chain of events that led to the human spillovers it is now known that both viruses originated in bats and were transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts normile and enserink 2003 killerby et al 2020 in particular the progenitor of sars-cov emerged through recombination among bat viruses and subsequently infected palm civets and other small carnivores eventually spilling over to humans cui et al 2019 mers-cov was most likely transmitted from bats to dromedary camels decades earlier than the first human cases were registered mller et al 2014 mers-cov displays limited human-to-human spread and most cases resulted from independent zoonotic transmission from camels cui et al 2019 it is thus unsurprising that the closest known relatives of sars-cov-2 are two bat coronaviruses batcov rmyn02 and batcov ratg13 identified in horseshoe bats rhinolophus malyanus and r affinis respectively zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2020b both batcovs display an average nucleotide identity of 95 with sars-cov-2 although with variations through the genome and they were detected in bats sampled in yunnan province china in 2019 and 2013 before the first detection of sars-cov-2 in humans zhou et al 2020b both the place and timing of batcov rmyn02 and ratg13 detection as well as their levels of identity with sars-cov-2 indicate that these viruses are not direct progenitors of the sars-cov-2 pandemic strain but clearly support the view that the latter had an ultimate bat origin zhou et al 2020b fig 1ain analogy to sars-cov and mers-cov several lines of evidence suggest that an intermediate host was responsible for the cross-species transmission of sars-cov-2 to humans first most although not all early covid-19 detected cases were associated with the huanan seafood and wildlife market in wuhan city where several mammalian species were traded huang et al 2020 this is reminiscent of the circumstances associated with the initial phases of sars-cov spread as palm civets were sold in wet markets and their meat consumed cui et al 2019 second in vitro experiments have shown that in addition to bats sars-cov-2 can infect cells from small carnivores and pigs zhou et al 2020b experimental in vivo infection and transmission in ferrets and cats was also reported kim et al 2020 shi et al 2020a third viruses very closely related 855 to 924 sequence similarity to sars-cov-2 were very recently detected in malayan or sunda pangolins manis javanica illegally imported in southern china lam et al 2020 the analysis of these viral genomes indicated that pangolins host at least two sub-lineages of sarbecoviruses which are referred as the guangdong and guangxi lineages after the locations where the animals were sampled lam et al 2020 fig 1a and b viruses in the guangdong lineage share high similarity with sars-cov-2 in the receptor-binding motif of the spike protein this same region is instead the most divergent between batcov ratg13 and sars-cov-2 lam et al 2020 zhou et al 2020b this observation is very relevant as the binding affinity between the spike protein and the cognate cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 in the case of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is a major determinant of coronavirus host range haijema et al 2003kuo et al 2000 mccray jr et al 2007 moore et al 2004 schickli et al 2004 indeed coronaviruses use a surface spike glycoprotein to attach to host receptors and gain entry into cells walls et al 2020 it is a homo-trimeric protein formed by two subunits s1 and s2 the s1 subunit contains an n-terminal domain connected by a linker of variable length to the receptor-binding domain rbd in various coronaviruses the n-terminal domain ntd and rbd contribute to define host range lu et al 2015 the s2 domain participates in membrane fusion duquerroy et al 2005 comparison of the complete spike protein as well as of the ntd indicated higher similarity of sars-cov-2 with ratg13 than with pangolin coronaviruses fig 1a domain based sequence analysis indicates that sequence variations are majorly confined to the s1-domain 16 variable sites than to the s2-domain fig 1c and mutations were observed in both ntd and rbd interestingly an insertion yltpgd is present only in the ntd of sars-cov-2 ratg13 and guangxi pangolin coronaviruses but absent in related bat coronaviruses in guangdong pangolin viruses the region is not fully covered by sequencing fig 1d this motif forms a conformational cluster at the exposed ntd regions of the spike trimer and may contribute to determine host range however as mentioned above within the rbd sars-cov-2 shows higher identity with pangolin viruses belonging to the guangdong lineage than to ratg13 fig 1b and d structural analysis of the binding interface between sars-cov-2 rbd and human ace2 shows a strong network of polar contacts pdb id 6m0j lan et al 2020 sars-cov-2 rbd mediates these polar interactions through lys417 gly446 tyr449 asn487 gln493 gln498 thr500 asn501 gly502 and tyr505 with ace2 fig 1e these residues which participate in polar interactions with the host protein are almost completely conserved with pangolin coronaviruses of the guangdong lineage fig 1done possible explanation for this observation is that the rbds of sars-cov-2 and guangdong pangolin viruses have been progressively optimized through natural selection convergent evolution to bind ace2 molecules from humans and pangolins and possibly other non-bat mammalian species lam et al 2020 an alternative possibility is that recombination events among coronaviruses hosted by bats pangolins and possibly other mammals originated the progenitor of sars-cov-2 lam et al 2020 cagliani et al 2020 it is presently impossible to disentangle these two alternative scenarios and only the sequencing of additional related sarbecoviruses might eventually clarify the evolutionary history of sars-cov-2 rbd it is also worth mentioning here that as previously noted andersen et al 2020 the similarity of the sars-cov-2 rbd with that of viruses only recently sequenced from pangolins can be regarded as a major evidence against the circulating theory that sars-cov-2 is the result of deliberate human manipulationin any case these data do not necessarily imply that pangolins had a role in the emergence of sars-cov-2 and in its spread to humans as these animals might have in turn contracted infection from a bat or other reservoir moreover the sars-cov-2 spike protein displays a unique feature that is not shared with either batcov ratg13 or the pangolin viruses namely the presence of a furin cleavage site insertion prra at the s1-s2 junction walls et al 2020 fig 1d and f this feature also absent in sars-cov was suggested to increase viral infectivity andor pathogenicity walls et al 2020 andersen et al 2020 it is presently unknown how and when sars-cov-2 acquired the furin cleavage site but it is equally unexplored whether it affects any viral phenotype or if it contributed to adaptation to humans or other hosts importantly though the presence of a similar insertion in a virus isolated from wild bats is another strong indication in favor of a natural animal origin of sars-cov-2 zhou et al 2020aalthough for the reasons mentioned above an as-yet unidentified intermediate host is likely to have played a role in the zoonotic transmission of sars-cov-2 in the wuhan market or elsewhere the possibility that sars-cov-2 was directly transmitted from bats to humans cannot be discarded indeed serological surveys on people living in proximity to bat colonies in yunnan province indicated that direct bat-to-human transmission of sars-cov related coronaviruses might occur wang et al 2018 in general wild animal trade might reduce the ecological barriers separating humans from coronavirus hosts including these bats or other mammals however the observation that some early covid-19 cases had no apparent epidemiological link to the huanan seafood and wildlife market huang et al 2020 opens the possibility that the virus originated elsewhere and that the crowded market only contributed to the spreading of the epidemic clearly wide sampling of coronavirus diversity in different mammals in china and neighboring countries will be necessary to track down the progenitors of sars-cov-2the scenarios described above implicitly imply that whatever the source of the zoonotic transmission sars-cov-2 emerged and adapted in another host eventually spilling over to humans andersen et al 2020 it cannot however be excluded that before being recognized in december 2019 sars-cov-2 had been circulating for a while in humans maybe causing mild symptoms the acquisition of some key viral mutations during unrecognized human transmission might have then fostered the current pandemic strain characterized by sustained human-to-human transmissibility and virulence in this case the identification of such mutations and the assessment of the role of the above-mentioned furin cleavage site insertion would be of paramount importance nonetheless it should be kept in mind that extreme caution should be exerted when ascribing phenotypic effect to mutations that arise during viral spreads grubaugh et al 2020 here again mers-cov and sars-cov have lessons to teach whereas in the case of sars-cov changes in the spike protein rbd contributed to the adaptation of the virus to human cells wu et al 2012 qu et al 2005 mers-cov adaptation to our species occurred with limited changes in the rbd cotten et al 2014 forni et al 2015 however during an outbreak of mers-cov in south korea viral strains carrying point mutations in the spike rbd emerged and spread kim et al 2016 notably whereas these rbd mutations were found to decrease rather than increase binding to the cellular receptor they facilitated viral escape from neutralizing antibodies kim et al 2016 kim et al 2019 rockx et al 2010 kleine-weber et al 2019 this suggests that changes in the spike protein do not necessarily arise as an adaptation to optimize receptor-binding affinityeven more emblematic is the case of sars-cov orf8 encoding an accessory viral protein in the early stages of the epidemic sars-cov strains acquired a 29-nucleotide deletion in orf8 chinese sars molecular epidemiology consortium 2004 together with the observation that the encoded protein is fast evolving in sars-cov strains this finding was taken to imply that deletions in orf8 were driven by natural selection and favored human infection lau et al 2015 the evidence for adaptation was subsequently not confirmed and recent data indicate that the 29-nucleotide deletion most likely represents a founder effect causing fitness loss in bat and human cells forni et al 2017 muth et al 2018 this observation clearly indicates that a mutation sweeping at high frequency in the viral population does not necessarily represent a selectively advantageous changeclearly huge gaps remain in our understanding of sars-cov emergence and adaptation to our species most likely acquisition of inserts in the spike protein and remodeling of the rbd did not occur in a single animal-to-human jump event the majority of relevant changes might have been present in a reservoirintermediate species and only minor changes may then have been required to gain full transmissibility in humansalternatively the progressive optimization from multiple zoonotic events may have followed short events of human-to-human transmission over an extended period of time this has been earlier observed during mers transmission entailing repeated jumps of mers-cov from camels cui et al 2019 accumulation of mutations in ntd and rbd during global and local transmissions further strengthens the likelihood that the progenitor virus may have been transmitted among humans over time adapting to become more efficiently transmitted in peoplein a nutshell the missing knowledge about the reservoirintermediate host of sars-cov-2 as well as about the extent of its distribution in wild and domestic animals raises concerns about zoonotic transmissions if pre-adaptation routinely occurs as these viruses incubate in animal reservoirs there is a high probability for new pandemics to recur thorough surveillance of animal populations and early diagnosis in people will be necessary to prevent future covid-19 like pandemicsclimate variability is known to affect the outbreaks of many infectious diseases morand et al 2013 vector-borne diseases such as murray valley

describes the changes that sars-cov-2 viruses underwent since they became widely recognized as pathogenic in december 2019 through mid-april 2020 it depicts relationships among hundreds of viral sequences sub-sampled from the thousands of sequences available at the time of writing as rendered for real-time evaluation by the nextstrain consortium httpsnextstrainorgncov using data from gisaidorgone feature establishes without question the usefulness of this tree contemporaneously sampled viruses each depicted by its own color are perfectly chronologically organized in this rendering each sample circle was colored to indicate when it was sampled the rainbow pattern means that each virus has undergone a nearly equal amount of change note too that the viruses do not bunch up at the tips of the tree but are situated throughout we need not guess when and where ancestors lived because we can see them lastly no branches protrude to any great extent eliminating the fear of being misled by tree artifacts introduced by recombination although recombination contributed to the origins of this viral group ji et al 2020 boni et al 2020 and future recombinations cannot be discounted this does not appear to have been a major force over this five month period by so faithfully reproducing these samples known chronology this tree should earn our trustthe total number of points at any column encompassing different time intervals informs about the sampling success at those times there are only a few sequences from the early weeks before january 15 followed by a clear increase until the beginning of february around february 5 then chinese researchers see below almost completely ceased to deposit sequences in gisaid and only a few sequences were being obtained from other countries this period corresponds to the silent spread of covid-19 throughout most countries asymptomatic infections were not detected hence no virus samples were available for sequencing and we lack detailed information on how the virus was spreading this period also corresponds to a bout of diversification that can be observed in the upper part of the tree with many new sublineages stemming from pre-existing lineages the times of these diversification events are inferred from the application of a constant rate of evolution of 8  104 substitutions per site per year the constancy of this evolutionary rate is difficult to be evaluated at this stage in the evolutionary history of the virus given the very short time elapsed since its appearance by the end of february the situation changed drastically as many more sequences became available for analysis when the pandemic exploded and cases accumulated rapidly in many countriessee below the same tree fig 4
 now colored to show each samples geographical origins as shown on the accompanying map note that isolates from china dominate the oldest branches of the tree the first isolates sequenced came from wuhan china where the epidemic was first recognized therefore it is logical that they should appear firstwhat other epidemiological inferences can we draw from tracing the path of this virus evolution
human infections may have commenced months before the recognized outbreak in wuhan most human pathogens originate as pathogens of other animals they occupy a spectrum emerging from those exclusively transmitted among animals to those primarily transmitted among other animals to those that have lost their dependence on non-human reservoirs and ultimately those no longer capable of being transmitted excepting from person to person wolfe et al 2007 the human drama now unfolding began in earnest in the latter months of 2019 the tree above records the viruss subsequent proliferation and spread but what can be said about preceding eventsserological evidence suggests that people living the vicinity of bats harboring sars-like viruses are frequently exposed to such infections wang et al 2018 more surveillance will be needed to truly understand how often and under what circumstances such exposures take place nor can we yet appreciate what proportion of such exposures eventually lead to a virus becoming established as a human pathogenacknowledging this broader context what do the phylogenetic data say about the proximate origins of sars-cov-2 more surveillance among the viruses of suspected animal reservoirs bats most especially will be needed to confidently estimate when and where this virus first took a firm foothold in people early reports lam et al 2020 zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2020b identified batcov ratg13 and rmyn02 as the closest isolates to sars-cov-2 and it has been proposed that these lineages diverged between 40 and 70 years ago boni et al 2020 assuming constancy in the evolutionary rate which is also problematic as discussed above a few months may have elapsed between human acquisition of the virus and its recognition by the medical and public health communities in december 2019 molecular clock analyses suggest a time for the most recent common ancestor of all current sars-cov-2 lineages in octoberdecember 2019 van dorp et al 2020 if further sampling identifies more genetically proximate enzootic viruses then the estimated times for separation and diversification may likewise change lacking such additional sampling it seems fair to suspect from the available evidence that an exclusively human chain of transmission may have gone undetected for some months before galvanizing public attention
some lineages took root outside of china note that clusters of viruses define foci of transmission some of these represent expansions outside of china for example a group almost exclusively composed of red dots near the bottom of the figure indicate a viral lineage that took root in the united states these mostly came from the state of washington although wyoming virginia and other states are included in the group within this cluster a few dots different to red indicate likely exports from the usa to other countries such as australia taiwan iceland and india nevertheless inferences about epidemiological processes drawn exclusively from genome information must be taken very cautiously villabona-arenas et al 2020
long-distance travel spread closely related viral isolates although most of the isolates in the group discussed above were sampled from patients in the american pacific northwest a few blue dots in that group denote australian isolates demonstrating air travel as a powerful disseminating force specific introductions ie from china to germany from germany to italy from italy to iceland gudbjartsson et al 2020 that accord with known travel histories are recapitulated in phylogenetic networks reconstructed from viral rna sequences for example the phylogeny accords with other evidence that the virus was introduced to europe by early january olsen et al 2020 spiteri et al 2020 stoecklin et al 2020
community transmission occurred weeks before local outbreaks were recognized early efforts in the united states to manage the virus focused on limiting travel from suspected endemic regions and early testing was limited to travelers returned from such places meanwhile the virus had already established footholds as discovered when nasal swabs collected for monitoring community transmission of influenza were discovered to harbor the rna of sars-cov-2 nearly identical viruses were found in residents of seattle who had no direct contact with one another this sounded the alarm that the virus was actively circulating in the community a fact that would soon be tragically borne out by a critical surge in illness and death bedford et al 2020 fauver et al 2020
multiple independent introductions of the virus a parallel process was soon to play out in new york based on the viral phylogeny it appears the virus was established in new york at least seven times primarily from europe while travel restrictions focused on perceived threats from china south korea italy and iran gonzalez-reiche et al 2020 the occurrence of red dots in nearly every clade of the tree even clades composed mostly of european isolates underscores this point this is equally true for europe because nearly every clade of the tree includes green dots denoting samples of european origin this tree includes relatively few isolates from australia blue dots but the same phenomenon is evident australia received virtually every basic type of sars-cov-2
the global south has not been sampled nearly enough a complete description of the virus evolution would necessitate vast and representative sampling with diagnosed cases as of mid-april numbering in the millions and in the face of untold numbers of undiagnosed cases how much confidence should we place in trees reconstructed from only hundreds or thousands of isolates biologists have means to assess internal consistency enabling many facets of the recorded history to be viewed by now as impervious to egregious sampling error nonetheless it is clear that the available evidence neglects to inform us much about the epidemic this is for lack of attention not for lack of virus even in the most affluent of societies the virus is exploiting preexisting social inequities yancy 2020 as the virus takes root in africa south america and other under-resourced regions evolutionary epidemiologists should assume responsibility for understanding and communicating all that can be learned about how where when and why the pandemic is unfolding there the toll of this disease will be multiplied where patients cannot access therapies and where clinicians cannot protect themselves there the behavior of the virus may or may not parallel patterns so far described we will not know if we do not looksars-cov-2 was first detected in human bronchoalveolar lavage bal specimens by unbiased illumina and nanopore sequencing technologies and a real-time rt-pcr assay using pan-betacoronavirus degenerate primers targeting a highly conserved rdrp region zhu et al 2020 the sars-cov-2 isolation was performed in different cell lines including human airway epithelial cells vero e6 and huh-7 cytopathic effects were observed in human airway epithelial cells 4 days after inoculation but not in vero e6 and huh-7 zhu et al 2020 for safety cdc recommends that clinical virology laboratories should not attempt viral isolation from clinical specimens collected from covid-19 patients under

website httpswwwwhointwho-documents-detailmolecular-assays-to-diagnose-covid-19-summary-table-of-available-protocols while the cdc assay was designed for specific detection of three different regions of the n gene the assay developed by corman et al 2020 aimed to amplify three different regions of the rdrp n and e genessince sars-cov-2 continues to spread around the world and the number of potential cases increases rapidly faster and more-accessible testing is extremely needed thus many companies are racing against the clock to develop commercial test kits to detect sars-cov-2 more quickly and accurately more than fifty rt-pcr-based diagnostic tests are currently available in the us that have been granted the fdas emergency use authorization httpswwwfdagovmedical-devicesemergency-situations-medical-devicesemergency-use-authorizationscovid19ivd these tests can qualitatively identify sars-cov-2s rna in the lower respiratory tract bronchoalveolar lavage sputum and tracheal aspirate and upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs recently the fda approved emergency use for a portable fast swab test for sars-cov-2 which can provide results in less than 15 min the idnow covid-19 abbott illinois can be used at a point-of-care in doctors offices urgent care and hospitals lateral flow immunoassays are another rapid point-of-care diagnostic test which has been widely used the sofia 2 sars antigen fia is the first covid-19 antigen test to be granted the fdas emergency use authorization this lateral flow immunofluorescent sandwich assay is used with the sofia 2 instrument intended for the qualitative detection of the nucleocapsid protein antigen from sars-cov-2 in nasopharyngeal and nasal swabsanother diagnostic approach would be to devise blood tests for antibodies against sars-cov-2 many companies around the world have raced to develop antibody tests the qsars-cov-2 iggigm rapid test cellex inc was the first antibody test being approved by the fda this test is intended to qualitatively detect igg and igm antibodies against the sars-cov-2 in human serum plasma and whole blood together with increased availability of commercial rt-pcr-based diagnostic tests important questions about immunity to the novel coronavirus will be answered soon the use of serological tests is complementary to those based on direct detection of viral rna because they indicate that the individual has developed specific immunological response to the virus which usually takes a few days after infection hence a negative result does not necessarily mean that a person is not infected - this might have occurred too recently to have developed the immune response and a positive results does not necessarily mean that the person has an active infection consequently these tests are essential to obtain a more precise estimate of the total number of infections in a population and in which proportion they are expected to be immune to a future infection by the virus its main use is in epidemiological surveillance rather than in clinical diagnostics early application of community surveys for seroprevalence have suggested far more widespread community exposure than has been supposed based merely on the reporting of diagnosed cases suggesting for example that by mid-april as many as one in five residents of new york city may have been exposed with diminishing exposure rates less proximate to the outbreaks epicenterrecently clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr based nucleic acid detection technology has emerged as a powerful tool with the advantages of rapidity simplicity and a low cost wang et al 2020 a recent study reported that the crispr-based assay was used to detect sars-cov-2 in the patients pharyngeal swab in china ai et al 2020 the turn-around time tat of crispr was 2 h much faster than rtpcr 3 h and mngs 24 h ai et al 2020 the fda authorized a covid-19 test that uses the gene-editing technology crispr sherlock crispr sars-cov-2 kit has been developed by sherlock biosciences incalthough host genetics is likely to be important for the outcome of infection because of the nature of the disease we only have preliminary information on the heritability of susceptibility to coronavirus infections ie estimates of the proportion of phenotypic variability due to genetic factors heritability a time and place-specific measurement for a population provides an indication of likely success in the hunt for susceptibility loci and low values for heritability of 20 would indicate that very large sample sizes might be needed to detect genetic effects williams et al 2020 have reported high heritability in the range 4050 of covid-19 symptoms in a classical twin study williams et al 2020 in addition the apparent differences in susceptibility seen between ethnic groups could be due in part to human genetic variability niedzwiedz et al 2020 report a higher risk of confirmed sars-cov-2 infection not accounted for by variables such as socioeconomic differences in some minority ethnic groups as included in the uk biobank niedzwiedz et al 2020 the genetic contribution to the outcome of infection will be complex since some of the underlying health conditions associated with death from coronavirus infection are known to have a significant genetic contributionthe difficulties of family-based studies whilst controlling for exposure leaves us with case control association methodology ultimately the high numbers of affected people will facilitate genome wide association studies gwas or even studies of whole genome or exome sequence particularly where genotypic information is already available as is the case for uk biobank participants in the short term we are likely to see a number of candidate gene studies for susceptibility to coronavirus infection per se loci coding for viral receptors provide obvious candidate genes nevertheless the major question is why some individuals develop life-threatening immune-mediated pathologies where knowledge of genetic variation may contribute to our understanding of key mediators of the immune responsemost relevant albeit limited information on the allelic diversity contributing to susceptibilityresistance to date has used sampling from the sars cov 2003 epidemic and a little information has been gleaned from the mers-cov 2012 epidemic sample sizes are small and results sometimes conflicting hence no firm conclusions can be drawn there are several studies identifying genes of interest from mouse models kane and golovkina 2019 and some information from interspecies comparisons hou et al 2010 sironi et al 2015 to date candidate genes for published human studies have included pathogen receptor genes and loci controlling innate and adaptive immunitys1 spike proteins of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 on cell membranes catalysing the cleavage of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin ii and countering the activity of ace mers-cov binds to the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 cd26 an immunoregulatory serine exopeptidase particularly considering indications of relevance from cross-species comparisons sironi et al 2015 there has been a surprising lack of interest in these 2 candidate loci for susceptibility to infection per se a small low-powered case control study with information on anti-sars-cov antibody status did not show any associations between sars phenotypes and ace2 polymorphisms in a vietnamese population itoyama et al 2005 genes coding for functionally associated molecules such as transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 which cleaves and activates viral spike glycoproteins are also worthy of study iwata-yoshikawa et al 2019 lopera et al 2020 have just reported a phewas of 178 quantitative phenotypes including cytokine and cardio-metabolic markers but not specific sars-cov-2 infection markers in relation to ace2 and tmprss2 variation lopera et al 2020amongst immune response related loci mhc class i and class ii allelic associations are to be expected particularly through mhc class i restriction of cd8 t cells lin et al 2003 ng et al 2004 wang et al 2011 keicho et al 2009 mhc associations are relevant for susceptibility to disease per se disease pathogenesis and response to vaccination there are a few follow up studies eg of hla a0201 restricted sars-cov epitopes for cd8 t cells zhao et al 2011 but investigation of such highly polymorphic loci needs to be more comprehensiveother loci with some information on allelic associations include those coding for icam3 dc-sign cd209 chan et al 2007 chan et al 2010 and dc-signr cd209l li et al 2008 and widely studied loci such as mbl zhang et al 2005 ip et al 2005 and cd14 in particular the inflammatory response associated with sars suggests a number of candidate loci eg ahsg zhu et al 2011 ifng chong et al 2006 cd14 yuan et al 2007 and ccl5 rantes ng et al 2007 nevertheless some relatively small studies have resulted in some conflicting findings being noted eg for mbl yuan et al 2005 and dc-signr li et al 2008more recently loci of interest have been identified using mouse models after infection with sars-cov where pathology can be well studied these include trim55 and ticam2 kane and golovkina 2019 trim55 codes for an e3 ubiquitin ligase present in smooth muscle around blood vessels affecting lung pathology by controlling airways and immune cell infiltration deficiency was relevant to lung injury although susceptibility alleles were not reported gralinski et al 2015 ticam2 knockout mice were highly susceptible to disease with some evidence of allelic heterogeneity ticam2 is an adaptor for myd88-independent tlr4 signaling contributing to innate immunity gralinski et al 2017 these genes require complementary studies in human populationsto date phenotypes employed for human genetics have been limited susceptibility to infection per se some measures of morbidity and mortality for both candidate gene studies and gwas finding totally resistant individuals for an unaffected control group is hard since for covid19 despite the occurrence of asymptomatic individuals many show very mild symptoms of disease there is scope for development of phenotypes particularly relating to the most pertinent issues of pathogenesis and control of immune responsiveness perhaps immediate research could focus on critical and potentially useful phenotypes eg severity of disease sufficient to require a ventilator or antibody responsesidentification of a susceptibility gene with no a priori hypothesis is difficult for an active acute viral infection but candidate genes potentially controlling these phenotypes would include those from both innate and adaptive immunity published gwas which might be of interest for suggesting susceptibility loci tend to have used phenotypes from chronic rather than acute conditions eg copd whether conducting genotypephenotype studies or simply measuring immune responses age and sex are clearly major factors in the outcome of infection with sars-cov-2 and will require careful consideration in all analysesimmunity and pathology will be influenced by many factors including genetics age sex viral dose and underlying health problems the interactions between these factors will also be important gubbels bupp et al 2018 covid19 particularly affects the elderly with age a key consideration in any study design as are sex differences which are known to be important for respiratory infections in general kadel and kovats 2018 although both innate and adaptive immunity are required to mount an effective immune response and despite the tools for investigation of the relevant loci being available the lack of candidate gene studies for coronavirus infection even prior to covid19 including information on mhc associations has been noted not only will variability in amino acid sequence be important such as that influencing mhc restriction but also the levels of immune mediators possibly driven by promoter variation timing of responses is another area for exploration rockx et al 2009 discuss molecular mechanisms of age related susceptibility in coronavirus infected mice and development of pathology via the host response aged mice showed a greater number of differentially expressed genes when infected than young mice including elevated interferon and cytokine genes indicating a different host response kinetics in old versus young micea number of immune response moleculesgenes are of interest including toll-like receptors tlrs proinflammatory cytokines and the appropriate signalling pathways both adaptive and innate immunity are recognized to decline with age goronzy and weyand 2013 nikolich-ugich 2018 and although in the past adaptive immunity has been the focus of attention there is now cumulative evidence for a decline in innate immunity with age changes occur in neutrophil macrophage dendritic cell and nk populations and there are changes in tlr expression with an overall distinct but not uniformly lower expression in later life particularly in macrophages and consequent major changes in tlr mediated responses solana et al 2012 the innate immune system of the frail elderly is often in a state of heightened inflammation but this higher basal production of proinflammatory cytokines does not necessarily translate to a generally elevated andor effective response fulop et al 2018 in particular the incidence of and mortality from lung infections increase sharply with age with such infections often leading to worse outcomes prolonged hospital stays and life-threatening complications such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome the review by boe et al 2017 covers research on bacterial pneumonias and pulmonary viral infections and discusses age-related changes in innate immunity that contribute to the higher rate of these infections in older populationsregulation of adaptive immune function appears to be diminished in old versus young adults and decreased tlr responses are associated with the inability to mount protective antibody responses to flu vaccine kollmann et al 2012 in addition the pre-existing b cell repertoire restricts the quantitative response in the elderly goronzy and weyand 2013 b cell maintenance and function in aging has been well reviewed and is of particular relevance when considering responsiveness to vaccines evoking primary versus memory humoral responses kogut et al 2012 the age-related rise in proinflammatory cytokines is also associated with reduced response to vaccination oh et al 2019 it is known that vaccination with tlr5 targeting adjuvants in elderly patients enhances flu vaccine responsiveness without increasing inflammation goronzy and weyand 2013we know multiple host factors including age and sex are important for disease outcome of coronavirus infection and a systems approach has been suggested for the study of disease pathogenesis schfer et al 2014 however to date we do not know the relative importance of factors such as host and pathogen genetic variability whilst we can draw some comparisons with other similar acute respiratory infections such as influenza sars-cov-2 presents unique and urgent challenges there is an unprecedented opportunity to obtain large sample sizes and the need to understand the role of human genetics in the outcome of infection with sars-cov-2 is well recognized kaiser 2020 information on infection with sars-cov-2 is being added to health data eg inclusion in the uk biobank with its 500000 volunteers wwwukbiobankacuk
 the scale of the current pandemic is stimulating free access to human genetic studies as they progress and data sharing for combined analyses with multiple diverse partners from academia and industry eg the covid19 host genetics initiative wwwcovid19hgorg
 hopefully useful information will be produced at a rate not previously seen for a transmissible diseasethere is limited knowledge on the mechanisms driving immune response against covid-19 a recent work thevarajan et al 2020 showed that a strong adaptive response across b and t cells was mounted during symptomatic phase in a 47-year-old woman from wuhan hubei province in china that successfully cleared the virus within two weeks increased antibody-secreting cells ascs follicular helper t cells tfh cells activated cd4 t cells and cd8 t cells and immunoglobulin m igm and igg antibodies that bound the covid-19-causing coronavirus sars-cov-2 were detected in blood before symptomatic recovery and with a peak around day 79 since onset of symptoms these immunological changes persisted after full resolution of symptoms at day 20 these findings based on a single subject support the hypothesis that a rapid multi-factorial immune response against covid-19 can be mounted within a week and with evidence of recruitment of t and b cells as well as macrophages before resolution of symptoms and that this rapid response may correlate with positive clinical outcomesevere cases on the other hand seem to have disrupted immune responses several early case reports have demonstrated the presence of cytokines release storms which demonstrate the presence of severe inflammatory responses in these patients characterised by increased interleukin il-2 il-7 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor interferon- inducible protein 10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1- and tumor necrosis factor-6 mehta et al 2020immunogenomics analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf and also from blood samples across two different studies from china wen et al 2020 liao et al 2020 also revealed clear immunological features characterizing severe cases the overall message based on these early studies point towards the polarization of a macrophage response in the lungs associated with severe disease conversely patients that recovered had increased cytotoxic t cell response compared to severe cases specifically analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf from 3 severe and 3 mild covid-19 patients using single-cell rna sequence scrna-seq combined with t cell receptor sequences revealed a distinct population of monocyte-derived fcn1 macrophages in balf samples from patients with severe disease while patients with mild disease presented increased levels of fabp4 alveolar macrophages liao et al 2020 these cells were found highly inflammatory and strongly associated with cytokine storms notably immunogenomics analysis on blood samples from 5 patients that had early recovery versus 5 patients that recovered late wen et al 2020 confirmed the findings in balf namely that mild disease was associated to clonally expanded cytotoxic cd8 t cells which suggest that a specific t cell response may be at play in controlling covid-19 infection in the lungsseveral vaccine trials are underway carrying great promise for sustainable solutions to future epidemics httpswwwwhointblueprintpriority-diseaseskey-actionlist-of-candidate-vaccines-developed-against-sarspdf with so far 33 vaccines listed accessed on april 25th 2020from a vaccine point of view it remains to be seen whether a strong humoral response mediated by neutralizing antibodies can be successfully mounted without side effects and whether t cell responses could be also generated by a vaccine based on current knowledge it appears that severe cases are associated with a sustained virus-specific immune response with evidence of a hyper-inflammatory response causing severe lung damage notably recent work revealed that sars-covid-19 specific cd4 and cd8 t cell responses are identified in 70 and 100 of convalescent patients respectively thus supporting the notion that viral specific adaptive response can be mounted and maintained griffoni et al 2020 the fact that all arms of the immune responses are activated in patients that clear the virus while in severe disease cytokine storms occur along with lymphopenia suggests that a broad t and b cell-based vaccine should be considered shi et al 2020bdata on sars-cov-2 so far revealed that several epitopes can be targeted by neutralizing antibodies response previous work on a sars-covmacaque models investigating host response in the productively infected lungs revealed unexpected interactions between the presence of antispike igg s-igg prior to viral clearance and the alveolar macrophages liu et al 2019 the latter population was found to undergo functional polarization in acutely infected macaques demonstrating simultaneously both proinflammatory and wound-healing characteristics however the presence of s-igg prior to viral clearance abrogated wound-healing responses and promoted mcp1 and il-8 production and proinflammatory monocytemacrophage recruitment and accumulation the authors commented that patients who died of sars displayed similarly accumulated pulmonary proinflammatory absence of wound-healing macrophages and faster neutralizing antibody responses whereas blockade of fcr reduced such effects therefore vaccine development should consider possible host responses that exacerbate disease and alternative therapies should be also considered in combination with vaccines to avoid virus-mediated lung injurythe current covid-19 pandemic has impacted on many aspects of social economic personal and behavioral matters of our daily life we still do not know when we will completely recover from these effects and when life will return to be normal it may never be the same as it used to be or with luck an effective vaccine becomes widely available and the return takes only a few months but the pandemic has also exposed scientists and the processes of scientific advancement by focusing on what the experts had to say about the new virus how to control its spread how to treat those infected or what to expect if different social measures should be taken it has shown that science advances through uncertainties and that different opinions and interpretations are frequent especially when moving through unexplored fields and a new pathogen is almost inevitably one such field and when it has such a dramatic impact on the health of so many people the need for urgent answers puts an extraordinary additional pressure on the daily work of scientistsin little more than four months we have learned a lot about sars-cov-2 and covid-19 we know that it is a new coronavirus closely related to those usually found in bats and quite oddly in an endangered species malayan pangolins but we do not know how the jump from a yet unknown intermediate species to humans occurred and how the virus was capable of being so easily and efficiently transmitted among individuals of our species from what we have learned from other zoonotic spillovers it seems clear that several factors have concurred in this jump including ecological cultural and possible behavioral we know that recombination is frequent in coronaviruses including sarbecoviruses but we do not know whether this process played a significant role in the emergence of sars-cov-2 as a new pathogen all the evidence gathered so far undermines the possibility that the virus was created in or escaped from a laboratory proximate to the city where the initial infections were detectedsars-cov-2 is highly transmissible even by asymptomatic and presymptomatic infected persons which makes its spread very difficult to control this can be observed in its fast expansion in just a few weeks to almost every country in the world and the poor efficiency of border closures as implemented by most governments to stop it when these have been put in action the virus was already circulating within borders genomic epidemiology of the virus is allowing a live monitoring of the viral spread and has revealed differentiation in several lineages some clearly resulting from ongoing local circulation which also show the frequent exchange across borders even from distant countries and continents globalization shows its dark side in this fast spreading pandemicthere are substantial differences in the natural history of infection these were observed from the very start of the epidemic with a much more severe presentation in aged persons and those with additional pathologies those differences have persisted but as the number of infected persons has grown continuously the cases of serious even fatal infections in younger persons have become more frequent nevertheless there are still many unknowns around the differences in susceptibility progression and outcome of the infection by sars-cov-2 that as in other infectious diseases probably depend on a complex interaction of host pathogen and environmental factors several large-scale analyses encompassing all three kinds of factors are underway and hopefully will shed light on this critical pointcurrently there are many additional unknowns highly relevant for the possibility of recovering a more or less normal lifestyle there is no specific and highly efficient treatment yet there are several vaccine candidates in the making but we are still at least months away from their availability for the general population we do not even know whether those infected by sars-cov-2 will develop a strong immune response or a weak one and how long it will last nor whether the virus will have a seasonal behavior or will circulate all year round in the meantime the most important measures to prevent a generalized spread of the virus and a collapse of health systems the main reason behind the social and economic disruption caused by covd-19 are still social distancing contact tracing and testingthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperover the past two decades there has been mounting interest in the increasing number of viruses causing unexpected illness and epidemics among humans wildlife and livestock all too often outbreaks have seriously stretched both local and national resources at a time when health-care spending in the economically developed world has been constrained importantly capacity to identify and control emerging diseases remains limited in poorer regions where many of these diseases have their originemerging disease is a term used with increasing frequency to describe the appearance of an as yet unrecognized infection or a previously recognized infection that has expanded into a new ecological niche or geographical zone and often accompanied by a significant change in pathogenicity1 the key message is that these are representative of constantly evolving infections responding to rapid changes in the relationship between pathogen and hostamong 1400 pathogens of humans over 50 of these have their origins in animal species that is are diseases or infections naturally transmitted between vertebrates and humans world health organization according to woolhouse and colleague2 emerging or re-emerging pathogens are far more likely to be zoonotic viruses are over-represented in this group moreover viruses with rna genomes account for a third of all emerging and re-emerging infections emerging pathogens are typically those with a broad host range often spanning several mammalian orders almost certainly many of these infections have been the result of the development of agricultural practices and urbanization figure 1recent interest in emerging infections has focused on three key areas first how the interplay of climate environment and human societal pressures can trigger unexpected outbreaks of emerging disease second the understanding of how viruses can transmit between a reservoir and new host species third identifying those aspects of the disease process that offer opportunities for therapy and prevention to these must be added a broader understanding of how viruses evolve over time clues to which are now being uncovered through looking closely at genetic elements of the host genome responsible for resisting virus invasion meeting these objectives will provide a more rigorous basis for predicting virus emergenceour environment is changing on an unprecedented scale climate change needs to be distinguished from climate variation change is where there is statistically significant variation from the mean state over a prolonged period of timethe most notable manifestations have been the increasing climatic conditions initiated by changes in sea surface temperatures in the pacific known as the el nio southern oscillation in the summer of 1990 an el nio event occurred which in turn led to a period of prolonged drought in many regions of the americas and the emergence of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome conversely a sudden reversal in sea temperature in the summer of 1995 resulted in heavy rainfalls especially in columbia resulting in resurgence of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and equine encephalitisvector-borne diseases are judged as highly sensitive to climatic conditions although the evidence for climatic change and altered epidemiology of vector-borne disease is generally regarded as particularly sensitive to temperature even a small extension of a transmission season may have a disproportionate affect as transmission rates rise exponentially rather than linearly as the season progresses climatic change can also bring about altered vector distributions if suitable areas for expansion become newly available again the effect may be disproportionate particularly if the vector transmits disease to human or animal populations without pre-existing levels of acquired immunity with the result that those clinical cases are more numerous and potentially more severe increased temperatures and seasonal fluctuations in either rainfall or temperature favor the spread of vector-borne diseases to higher elevations and to more temperate latitudes56
aedes aegypti a major vector of dengue is limited to distribution by the 10 c winter isotherm but this is shifting so threatening an expansion of disease ever northward7the relentless change inflicted by humans on habitats in the name of progress has also had a marked effect on rodent habitats outbreaks of bolivian hemorrhagic fever in bolivia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the united states have been clearly associated with abnormal periods of drought or rainfall leading to unusually rapid increases in rodent numbers of all species of mammals rodents are among the most adaptable to comparatively sudden changes in climate and environmental conditions small climatic changes can bring about considerable fluctuations in population size inhabiting desert and semidesert areas particularly in food quantity and quality a prolonged drought in the early 1990s in the four corners region of the united states led to a sharp decline in the numbers of rodent predators such as coyotes snakes and birds of prey but at the end of the drought heavy rainfall resulted in an explosion in pion nuts and grasshopper populations which in turn resulted in a rapid escalation of rodent numbers among them deer mice carrying hantavirusesa similar set of circumstances occurred in the beni region of bolivia in the 1960s when a period of prolonged drought was followed by rain an exponential rise in the numbers of calomys callosus field voles followed exacerbated by the use of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt in use at that time to reduce mosquito numbers this had the unfortunate consequence of reducing the local peridomestic cat population that had hitherto kept feral rodent numbers in check the consequence of these sharp climatic changes was the emergence of bolivian hemorrhagic fever caused by the arenavirus machupo this pattern of severe oscillations of rain and drought markedly affect murine species and insect vector numbers and act as an indicator that disease emergence may occur in the period following such changes a similar pattern of events occurred in 1994 when in venezuela an outbreak of what originally thought was due to dengue virus was in fact another example of the emergence of a novel arenavirus8evolving in the old world murines are a comparatively recent introduction into the new world most probably via the bering land isthmus some 2030 million years ago whilst other rodents have declined in number murine rodents have thrived especially in peri-urban areas this means that although species diversity has become less with fewer genera represented those remaining have multiplied many times over it is among species of the family muridae that reservoir hosts of arenaviruses and hantaviruses are to be found in south americadeforestation has accelerated exponentially since the beginning of the twentieth century and in the amazonian basin and parts of southeast asia has had a profound effect on local ecosystems particularly by constraining the range of natural predators instrumental in keeping rodents insects and other potential carriers of infectious disease under control9 the reduction in biological diversity can trigger the invasion and spread of opportunistic species heralding the emergence of disease through increased contact with local human populationsarthropod-borne infections such as congo-crimean hemorrhagic fever could pose a substantial risk to both humans and livestock in europe should climatic conditions raise further the ambient spring temperature infected immature ticks carried on migratory birds would molt in much greater numbers although such an enhancement in molting might be offset by a significant reduction in the number of migratory birds10air travel represents a major risk factor for the global spread of a new infectious agent it is estimated that over 100 million passenger journeys by air are made every year it is feasible to visit as many as three continents in a few hours this is in marked contrast to just 50 years ago when many people rarely if ever traveled any distance from their place of residence frequent air travel is now regarded as a major contributing factor to the spread of emerging diseases this is vividly illustrated by examining the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus in 2003 when the infection was disseminated from china to at least 17 countries in less than a week based on the events of 2003 hufnagel11 have designed a mathematical model that simulates accurately the spread of sars virus to countries that experienced four or more cases the utility of having a model means that once preliminary data are available a prediction can be made as to those regions most at risk moreover the work shows how difficulty if would be to contain an outbreak by vaccination alone were one available once the statistical information is available such a model can be used to predict those regions most at risk in the event of any future sars epidemic were a vaccine available the initial spread of virus might be contained if only a third of the population were immunized in the regions where the outbreak is focused this assumes an index case made a single air journey however this increases substantially to 75 in the event of an index case making two journeys with the whole population requiring vaccination if the same passenger made three trips analysis of air traffic from mexico at the start of the 2009 influenza h1n1 pandemic suggests the risk of spread is particularly great when the volume of air traffic is high but resources to report and trace diseased individuals is restricted12ground transport offers a more favorable route for transmission approximately 17 of all ravel in europe is by public ground transport in contrast air travel represents less than 02 of all passenger kilometers traveled13 in contrast to airliners public trains buses etc are rarely fitted with high efficiency particulate air hepa filtersit is not only humans that travel the international air transport association estimate that around 80 000 wild-caught animals are air freighted each year many being placed in holding facilities close to populated areas whilst in transit even mosquitoes may be carried it is thought that west nile virus wnv entered the united states as a result of an infected mosquito surviving the air journey from the middle east to new york city in 199914the incursion of wnv into north america is an excellent example of a virus expanding into an ecological niche where transmission-competent vectors are already present once established in and around the new york area the availability of vertebrate hosts most notably corvids together with optimal climatic conditions for vector populations enabled the rapid spread of wnv across the united states epizootic outbreaks have occurred frequently with an escalating number of neurological cases among the immunocompromised and the elderly15among all species of mammals members of the family muridae have been the most successful and are found in almost all habitats this family has species that are the natural hosts of almost all arenaviruses and hantaviruses as noted above rodents are highly susceptible to climate and ecological change resulting in variable population numbers among the fastest reproducing mammals field voles can have over 15 broods per year each with an average of six pups this in turn considerably increases the risk of human exposure to any pathogens they may carry as well as stimulating such pathogens to undergo mutational adaptations to the changing ecosystems rodents thrive on contaminated food and water and are excellent swimmers that rodents constitute an important part of the earths biomass is manifested by estimates of rodents consuming at least a fifth of the worlds output of grainthe preeminent property of the arenaviruses is the establishment of a long-term chronic infection in their principle murine reservoir although rodents are divided into over 30 families worldwide arenaviruses are found mainly within two rodent families the muridae and cricetidae eg field voles lemmings gerbils each arenavirus is not necessarily found distributed throughout the populations of any particular host reservoir howeverthe natural reservoirs of the old world arenaviruses are members of the genera mastomys and praomys these rodents included within the family muridae frequent human dwellings and food stores and as a result humans become infected through exposure to the rodents urine nearly all arenaviruses found in the americas are associated with cricetid rodents of open grasslands and foresthantaviruses have emerged as major causes of zoonotic diseases again associated with exposure to rodents belonging to the family muridae there is a tight relationship between virus and its native rodent host with each rodent species being infected with a single virus outbreaks of human disease are thus intimately related to the geographical distribution of the host reservoirthe agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is associated with the murine species apodemus agrarius a common field rodent found throughout most of the northern hemisphere this rodent invades outbuildings and food stores entering homes when rodent numbers increase as a result of changing environmental factors for example abnormal rainfall this is best exemplified by the emergence of sin nombre virus in the four corners region of the united states in 1993 the causative agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome the emergence of this agent was totally unexpectedthe four corners outbreak instigated intensive research into how fluctuations of rodent populations precipitate outbreaks of human disease abnormal weather patterns and increased rainfall results in a dramatic increase in the vegetation providing food for rodents thus the environment is able to suddenly sustain a rapidly expanding number of animals as population sizes explode the chances of rodents encroaching into peridomestic areas and households also increases especially when the over abundance of food comes to an end as a consequence there is a rise in the incidence of human illness as individuals have a much greater chance of coming into contact with excreta from persistently infected animals the chance of virus switching into other rodent species also becomes a greater possibility as rodent territories expand and overlapswitching to a new rodent host can have a profound effect on virus evolution adaptation of hantaviruses to new hosts can stimulate the development of new virus phenotypes and hence expansion into new ecological niches examples of this include the divergence of saaremaa virus from dobrava virus nemirov et al17 have suggested this has been the consequence of dobrava virus switching from yellow-striped field mouse apodemusflavicollis to a agrarius the striped field mouse the result is a virus with presumed reduced pathogenicity for humans other examples of host switching include transmission of monongahela virus from peromyscus maniculatis to p leucopus eventually giving rise to new york virus18 and the crossing of puumala virus from clethrionomys species to lemmus species and onto microtus species giving rise to the topografov and khabarovsk virus lineages19during an investigation of the 1998 hendra virus outbreak in queensland australia it was noticed that grazing horses often sought shelter under trees containing bat roosts wild fruit bats in such roosts were found positive for virus and neutralizing antibodies found in otherwise healthy bats20 similarly the related nipah virus found in malaysia and bangladesh has also been associated with pteropus bats youngsters had been exposed to the secretions of fruit bats when picking fruit or processing date palm oil from bat-infested treesbats have long since been known as the principal hosts of lyssaviruses with distinct phylogenetic differences for example between rabies virus strains circulating in bats and terrestrial mammals such as foxes raccoons and dogs the link between genetic variability and spatial epidemiology among the lyssaviruses gives a particularly good insight as to how viruses of wildlife can adapt and emerge into different animal populations rabies virus in europe has switched host many times over the past century adapting rapidly to new hosts as the virus expands into new species with time rabid bats exhibit abnormal behavior losing their natural fear of humans and thus present a greater risk of transmission to humans despite the availability of vaccines and post-exposure prophylaxis rabies remains a major zoonotic threat21given the increasing evidence of bats as reservoirs of emerging infections22 it is worth considering the evolution and diversity of these mammals nearly 1000 species are distributed throughout the world with the majority in areas close to the equator where food sources are most abundant belonging to the mammalian order chiroptera bats are broadly divisible into the old world fruit-eating bats 180 species suborder megachiroptera and the microbatssome 800 species grouped into 17 families within the suborder microchiroptera insectivorous bats are all microbats bats evolved around 50 million years ago with the fruit bats evolving along a very different path to the insect-eating species bats are found in most terrestrial habitats with species distribution varying widely some being restricted to a single island others being found across continents among the latter is miniopterus schreibersii from which negredo et al23 isolated lloviu virus from a cave in north-eastern spain schreibers bats are found throughout southern europe as far south as south africa and as far east as japanfruit-eating bats are not normally cave dwelling normally forming roosts in tree-tops or crevices in decaying trees and thus present opportunities for spread to humans many bats travel long distances for food especially fruit-eating species who respond to ever varying supply of food and who must compete with birds and other animals flights covering distances of 1520 miles from the roost is the norm although some species will forage over a distance of 30 miles in a single night while both insectivorous and fruit eating bats have been shown to harbor zoonotic viruses fruit-eating bats represent the biggest risk for human contact most of the flesh of fruit is discarded from the mouth of feeding animals thus providing ample opportunity for virus spreadseveral species hypsignathus monstrosus epomops fraqueti myonycteris torquata have been successfully infected with ebola virus sustaining the presence of virus in organs and blood for as long as 3 weeks asymptomatic ebola virus infection has been reported in insectivorous bats trapped in central africa and recent exposure to fruit bats has been a feature of at least one outbreak24
rousettus aegyptiacus is one species in which antibodies to both marburg and ebola viruses have been found rousettus species are the exception despite being fruit-eaters these bats form roosts deep within caves marburg virus sequences have also been found in wild-caught rhinolophus eloquens and miniopterus inflatus25 intriguingly filovirus elements have been found in some mammalian species leading to the suggestion that filoviruses have co-evolved with their mammalian hosts over many millennia26pigs have been implicated in several outbreaks of emerging infections starting in september 1998 clusters of human cases of encephalitis began to be reported from the malaysian states of perak and negri sembilan by far the most extensive outbreak was in the village of sungai nipah near the city of bukit polandok almost all of the cases had a direct link to the local piggeries and coincided with accounts of illness amongst pigs 1 to 2 weeks beforehand a total of 265 cases were notified with mortality approaching 40 in march 1999 infection developed in 11 singaporean abattoir workers handing pig carcasses one of which proved fatal initially these outbreaks were believed due to japanese encephalitis je but a number of cases had been vaccinated previously against je virus and there was no evidence of je virus antibodies among the remainder the link with hendra virus soon followed after the isolation of virus from an infected pig farmer the new agent now named nipah virus after the locality it was first reported shares 80 sequence homology with hendra virus with both viruses now being regarded as members of the henipaviruses within the paramyxoviridae family it is clear that nipah virus is widely distributed across northeast india bangladesh and southeast asia with phylogenetic analyses revealing the virus to be diverging within specific geographical localitiessince balayan et al27 first showed that pigs could be infected with hepatitis e virus hev there has been interest in the zoonotic potential of this agent especially in rural areas of the indian subcontinent where a high mortality rate is frequently observed amongst pregnant women hev appears ubiquitous in pigs and poultry regardless as to whether there is evidence of infection in the local community pigs become infected around 3 months of age but suffer only a mild transient infectionthe worldwide distribution of infected pigs means there is ample opportunity for transmission especially in southeast asia where most pigs are kept in family smallholdings antibody prevalence as a result is higher than compared to the general population for example hsieh et al28 found 27 of taiwanese pig handlers were seropositive compared to 8 in the general population swine had become infected by the fecaloral route with pig feces containing large quantities of virus it is not clear whether humans have been directly infected via this route or if there is a common source or reservoircross-species transmission is likely to be dependent upon genotype most swine isolates are genotype 3 or 4 whereas the majority of human infections are of genotype 1 and 2 pigs are not alone in being susceptible to hev with various reports of rats lambs dogs cats goats cattle and chickens also being susceptible chicken isolates are only 62 identical in genome sequence with human and swine isolates leading to the suggestion that hev in poultry may represent a distinct genus29 as with swine hev serological studies have shown that approximately 70 of poultry flocks in the united states are infected with hev30 there is no evidence of transmission from poultry to humans but of course this could change especially since work so far has shown isolates are genetically heterogeneous and thus adaptation could readily occurswine in the philippines have been found to act as reservoirs for reston virus a filovirus related to ebola and marburg viruses this was discovered during an unusually severe outbreak of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome reston virus was first identified in 1990 among non-human primates imported from the philippines to several primate handling facilities in the united states and europe but in contrast to its african relatives reston virus does not appear to cause human illness although there is ample evidence of reston viral antibodies in primate holding facilities31 and among those working with swine32pigs are susceptible to human avian and swine influenza viruses and thus play an important role in the epidemiology of human influenza influenza a virus is one of the comparatively few viral respiratory pathogens of pigs currently three subtypes circulate in swine h1n1 h1n2 and h3n2 in contrast to human influenza the properties of swine influenza differ from region to region the predominant subtype in europe is of avian origin most likely introduced into pigs in 1979 from wild aquatic birds such as ducks in contrast there are two distinct subtypes circulating in north america the classical h1n1 subtype introduced into pigs shortly after the 1918 human pandemic and the second a reassortment between h1n1 with either h3n2 or h1n1 virusesdomesticated pigs have often been regarded as a mixing vessel for influenza viruses and reassortment of the seven viral gene segments presenting an opportunity for new human strains to arise until 2009 however swine influenza was not regarded as a significant cause of serious disease in humans cases of human infection began to emerge towards the end of april 2009 in what is normally regarded as the influenza season in the northern hemisphere beginning first in mexico the new virus subtype often referred to as swine flu by the popular press spread rapidly throughout the world in a matter of weeksanalyses of human isolates quickly showed the unusual nature of this swine-origin influenza virus as being a triple reassortment virus containing genes from avian human and classical swine influenza viruses the ancestors of this virus had probably been circulating in pig populations for over 10 years but had remained undetected33 at the time there was considerable uncertainty as to the pathogenic potential of this virus but data soon showed the severity for humans to be less than that seen with the 1918 pandemic but on a par with the 1957 hong kong pandemic transmissibility appeared higher than is normally the case for seasonal influenza with a higher than normal attack rate importantly younger age groups appeared more susceptible possibly due to partial immunity among older cohorts as a result of being infected during previous pandemicsfrequent contact with companion animals such as dogs cats and horses provide additional opportunities for the transmission of animal diseases to humans although companion animals have been kept within households over the centuries the number of known emerging infections from such sources is remarkably few dogs in particular have been domesticated for over 8000 years and occupy a prominent position in the daily life of many societies search for the cause of respiratory disease in dogs is thus a particular focus for veterinary virologists and the application of modern molecular screening techniques has uncovered a number of canine homologues of human viruses the discovery of a canine flavivirus distantly related human hepatitis c virus hcv raises some intriguing questions as to the origin of hcv in human populations34 although evidence was found of virus in the canine liver there is as yet no evidence of this canine hepatitis c-like virus causing liver disease in dogs whether or not hcv first emerged from dogs remains speculative but the finding of virus in the respiratory secretions of infected dogs certainly indicates a ready route of transmission to humansthe finding of novel flavivirus in dogs has promoted a search for related viruses in other companion animal species by first generating a serological assay using expressed ns3 protein from the canine flavivirus burbelo et al35 have recently found a related virus in eight of 36 seropositive horses belonging to owners in the state of new york there was no supporting evidence of clinical disease among all the animals tested this does not preclude a pathogenic potential for humans of course as with the canine flavivirus described above any persistence of the newly described virus appears to be much lower than the average 50 seen in humans infected with hcv whether or not hcv originates in evolutionary terms from either dogs or humans studies indicate that hcv most likely originated from animal species a conclusion that has hitherto been difficult to accept as hcv does not cause disease in non-human primates as is the case with hepatitis b and other causes of viral hepatitiswild animals held or bred in captivity have long fascinated human societies there is an increasing trend particularly in more affluent economic countries to keep wild animals as pets it is estimated that approximately 350 000 wild caught animals are traded around the world each year adding to the risk of potentially zoonotic infections crossing the species barrier into humans the finding of a new arenavirus in boa constrictors boa constrictor suffering from snake inclusion body disease36 has raised interesting questions as to how common such viruses might be among captive wild animals intriguingly sequence data from this arenavirus showed diversity compatible with a pre-existing relationship between host and virus over time moreover sequences were found homologous to those present in arenaviruses causing severe hemorrhagic fever eg lassa virus but surprisingly the snake arenavirus also shared glycoprotein sequences with filoviruses this would suggest there has been segment recombination at some point in time with a filovirus that subsequently evolved to be the ebola and marburg viruses of todaythe keeping of small rodents and mammals has been linked to zoonotic disease for many decades lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus transmitted as a result of handling persistently infected hamsters being a prime example the keeping of prairie dogs is common in the united states and indirectly led in 2003 to an outbreak of monkey pox in the state of wisconsin37 this totally unexpected occurrence was the result of housing prairie dogs intended for sale in close proximity to small rodents imported from the african continent most notable rope squirrels funisciurus spp and gambian giant rats cricetomys spp although there were not fatalities among the 81 reported cases it presented an opportunity for the spread of monkey pox into the feral mammal population of north america it remains to be seen if wild animals become a source of monkey pox outbreaks in years to come38a worrying complication is the emergence of mild human infections due to vaccinia virus successfully used in the control and eradication of smallpox transmitted from herds of diary cattle in brazil and in buffaloes in india these instances of feral vaccinia may have originated from human vaccines being inadvertently introduced into livestock from whence the virus has been reintroduced into their keepers to cause a disease resembling cowpox39 there is also evidence for vaccinia virus infection among black howler allouata caraya and capuchin monkeys cebes apella inhabiting the amazonian rainforestviruses must bind to one or more receptors on the surface of the target cell in order to enter and infect cells new diseases can emerge when viruses evolve the ability to bind to either a new receptor in a novel target host species or use the homologue of an existing receptor in a new speciesin 2002 an outbreak of sars coronavirus occurred in hong kong and spread to individuals in 37 countries40 there is wide acceptance that sars-cov crossed into the human population of southern china in 2002 from himalayan civets panguma larvata as well as from racoon dogs nyctereutesprocyonoides and chinese ferret badgers melogalemoschata however there is evidence that at least some of these animal infections were the result of cross-transmission in the wet markets of guangzhou and that wild examples of these species caught in the wild did not show evidence of sars-cov infection more exhaustive studies of wild animal populations found sars-cov in chinese horseshoe bats41 however virus from bats could not be isolated directly in human cells adaptation through palm civets or other species seems to be required before adaptation to humans can occurin order to infect humans sars coronavirus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor but no bat coronavirus has been shown to use bat or human ace2 as a viral receptor raising questions on the mechanism used by coronaviruses to make the species jump from bats to humans42 mutations in the ace2 receptor-binding domain of the s spike protein particularly substitutions of lysine to asparagine at residue 479 k479n and serine to threonine at amino acid 487 s487t are both required for adaptation to human cells42 recent evolutionary studies have revealed that bats have coevolved with an as yet unknown factor that drove rapid evolution of the residue of bat ace2 that interacts with sars coronavirus and that ace2 utilization preceded the emergence of sars coronavirus capable of infecting humans this virus could have pre-existed in bats or could have been a newly created virus resulting from recombination between two bat coronavirus43 this phenomenon may be widespread in animalpathogen interactions for example studies on the evolution of transferrin receptors in canine species demonstrate that canine parvovirus is a re-emerged and not a novel pathogen in dogs44 these evolutionary studies of cellular receptors provide valuable insight into the factors that govern the evolution of receptor use in cross-species transmissioninfluenza viruses can emerge in new hosts through adaptation of the surface haemagglutinin structures to receptors on the new host plasma membrane influenza a viruses originate in aquatic birds preferentially binding to sialic acid residues on the surface of avian or human cells however avian influenza viruses have a higher affinity for sialic acid linked to the galactose unit via an 23 bond whereas human influenza viruses have a higher affinity for sialic acid linked via an 26 configuration45 this reflects the pathology of the disease in birds where the main target organ is the gastrointestinal tract whereas sialic acid on the human respiratory tract contains predominantly 26 linkages influenza virus preferentially replicates in non-ciliated cells of the upper respiratory tract during the early stages of the human illness whereas avian viruses have a preference for 23 sialic acid-coated ciliated cells found only in the lower respiratory tract receptor specificity therefore does not necessarily mean that cross-species transmission will give rise to the same pathology as seen in the donor speciesalthough much is known regarding the interactions between influenza a viruses and host cell receptors there is considerable subtlety in these interactions that is not yet understood for example influenza h9n2 virus circulates widely in birds throughout asia yet does not seem to cause significant human morbidity despite an increased affinity for sialic acid linked via 26 linkages46the study of arenaviruses offers an excellent opportunity for revealing the molecular basis of co-evolution of viruses with their rodent host and their potential emergence as a human pathogen phylogenetically arenaviruses are divisible into old world and new world according to geographical origin with the new world arenaviruses subdivided further into three clades a b and c clade b viruses are pathogenic for humans and share with members of clade a an ability to recognize transferrin receptor 1 tfr1 on cell surfaces although both clade a and clade b viruses recognize murine tfr1 only clade b viruses have evolved the capacity to also bind human tfr1 a single amino-acid change in the viral g1 envelope glycoprotein appears sufficient for this expansion of host range to humans intriguingly arenaviruses may have merged as human pathogens by more than one independent pathway of adaptation clade c new world arenaviruses share with old world arenaviruses an affinity for -dystroglycan a highly conserved cell surface protein involved in adhesion to the extracellular matrix in binding -dystroglycan these viruses can bypass the early endocytic pathway through uptake into smooth vesicles47as with receptor usage small changes to other viral proteins may have a profound outcome on whether or not a new host can support virus replication one example is hepatitis c virus a member of the flaviviridae family attempts to culture the virus in cell monolayers were unsuccessful until a strain from a japanese patient with fulminant hepatitis jfh-1 was isolated this strain contains a modification in the polymerase gene ns5a which for reasons that are incompletely understood has permitted the generation of chimeras representing all of the hcv genotypes that are infectious in culture48high rates of nucleotide substitution rates exhibited by rna viral genomes ensure that rna viruses can adapt rapidly to changes in the levels of host immunity the availability of suitable vectors and the ecology of any animal reservoir infected mammalian cells are deficient in the necessary repair mechanisms to correct errors in template transcription these errors are preserved if they do not prevent the formation of new infectious virus particles for example there have been multiple independent cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency virus siv from chimpanzees to humans which have given rise to pandemic group m and non-pandemic groups n and o clades of hiv-1 a single amino acid change in the gag-encoded matrix protein m30r is present in these cross-species transmissions furthermore when hiv-1 encoding the gag mutation was passaged in chimpanzees this mutation reverted this provides evidence for host-specific adaptation during the emergence of hiv-1 and identifies the viral matrix protein as a modulator of viral fitness following transmission to the new human host49a number of rna viruses possess segmented genomes reassortment of individual segments may occur in the event of a single cell being infected simultaneously with two genotypically distinct viruses reassortment event are known to play a major role in the emergence of new influenza virus strains leading to major changes in pathogenicity for animals and humans alike this process is increasingly recognized as occurring among other rna viruses containing structurally distinct genome segments for example the bunyaviruses in 1997 an outbreak of rift valley fever was detected in northeastern kenya and western somalia following a period of abnormal rainfall around 370 human deaths were recorded mainly in the garissa region of kenya surprisingly however there was evidence of rift valley fever virus rfv infection in only 23 of cases the cloning of pcr products revealed the existence of a new recombinant bunyavirus one that contained the l and s rna segments of bunyawera virus and an ill-defined m segment distantly related to ngari virus a bunyavirus previously reported from senegal in 197950 ngari virus is widely distributed across sub-saharan africa and as far south as madagascar the result in the garissa outbreak was the emergence of a new recombinant virus with substantial virulence for humans this new recombinant virus occurred independently of rfv infection during the outbreak the number of infections also the result of environmental factors that equally resulted in an elevation of rfv activityalthough not a zoonosis the recently described schmallenberg virus of ruminants in europe illustrates how unexpectedly members of the bunyavirus genus within the family bunyaviridae can spread preliminary analyses of the s rna segment show a close relationship between schmallenberg virus and members of the simbu serogroup normally found in asia51genetic recombination is known to pay an important role in generating new coronaviruses and such events may increase the likelihood of cross-species transmission as well as determine the severity of disease outcome52 this may explain the greater genetic diversity of sars-cov isolated from bats compared to humans and civets there is a marked difference between human sars-cov and bat sars-like coronavirus in the s gene bearing the cellular receptor domain with only 7678 amino-acid identity in the major spike s proteinproinflammatory responses also play a pivotal role in determining disease outcome with viruses manipulating host innate immune responses in order to promote entry and dissemination and host cells have also evolved countermeasures that give rise to genetic arms races with both virus and host competing against the other following initial infection of a host cell many host restriction factors recognize viruses and directly inhibit replication hiv and siv are recognized by several host restriction factors in their respective primate hosts tripartite motif-containing protein 5 trim5 is a species-specific host restriction factor that restricts the replication of hiv-1 in old world monkeys such as rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys rhesus trim5 restricts hiv-1 infection by interacting with the hiv-1 capsid at an early stage of infection and is believed to be involved in the innate immune response to retroviral infection recent studies investigating experimental cross transmission of siv from sooty mangabeys have revealed that trim5 exerts selective pressure during the initial stages of cross species transmission to rhesus macaques due to attenuation of infection rather than an outright block to infection53 however rhesus trim5 does not restrict siv isolated from macaques and human trim5 does not restrict hiv-1 infection54 although the introduction of single amino-acid mutation in the spry domain of trim5 can restore its ability to recognize and restrict hiv55 different primate orthologues of trim5 have recognition specificities for different retroviral capsids and infection is only blocked when recognition occurs56 similarly apolipoprotein b mrna-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3g apobec3g and tetherin are two host proteins that restrict the replication of retroviruses including hiv and siv by inducing degradation of the viral proteins and by inhibiting viral release the retroviral proteins viral infectivity factor and viral protein u counteract apobec3g and tetherin respectively5758 recently a study of four african green monkey subspecies which can be infected with divergent strains of siv highlighted that even in nonpathogenic infection there is ongoing evolution of simian apobec3g in the absence of ongoing disease in response to these changes both natural isolates from long-term infected individuals and viruses from experimentally infected individuals adapt to retarget the host restriction factor59 these studies highlight the ongoing conflict between virus and host and may contribute to the species specificity of closely related retroviruses recent studies have shed light on factors that determine the pathogenicity of siv and hiv-1 in different host species hiv-1 and siv infection of humans and rhesus macaques respectively are associated with chronic immune activation and production of tumor necrosis factor- from macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation60 in contrast in chronically infected sooty mangabeys the macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide is inhibited figure 2 a finding consistent with a suppressed chronic immune activation in non-pathogenic infection that is not observed in pathogenic infectionsthere have been several recent examples of viral subversion of the host innate immune system in order to promote infection and dissemination viruses must cross epithelial and endothelial barriers in order to invade organs such as lung gut and brain which are protected by sheets of polarized cells that restrict the passage of substances across these layers these do not express viral receptors on their apical surfaces human type 5 adenoviruses use two receptors constitutive androstane receptor car and 35 integrin in order to infect airway epithelial cells although the mechanism of infection at the apical surface has been unclear since both viral receptors are not expressed at the apical side of the cells yet both are required for viral infection car and 35 integrin are not normally available for viral binding being a component of tight junctions and the basolateral membranes of polarizedepithelia respectively however macrophages respond to viral infection by secretion of il-8 cxcl8 that in turn triggers the delocalization of 35 from the basolateral membrane to the apical cell surface thus transforming the cell into a potential host for replication61 thus it is conceivable that viruses crossing from one species to another may utilize secondary receptor elements shared between closely related species as a means of initiating infection in a new hostin a landmark study everitt and colleagues62 have shown that the action of interferon-inducible trans-membrane protein m3 ifitm3 can profoundly alter the course of influenza virus infection in humans the genotypes of ifitm3 found in hospitalized patients correlated with lower levels of ifitm3 expression leading to uncontrolled virus replication in the lungs and lower respiratory tract disease in those individuals with no acquired immunity to the infecting virus genotypemeasles virus initially infects macrophages and dendritic cells in the airway before crossing the airway epithelium and infecting lymphatic organs measles virus uses slamcd150 as a viral receptor but this is not expressed on all target cells which led to the notion that another receptor was also used for measles virus infection using well-differentiated primary airway epithelial cell sheets several groups elegantly demonstrated that following measles replication within lymphoid tissue virus uses the junction protein nectin-4 to bind to the basolateral lung side of polarized epithelia where it replicates and disseminates to nave hosts6364 these studies highlight the necessity of using in vitro culture systems that closely mimic the physiology of the cells in vivo65ebola viruses can effectively inhibit host interferon type i responses mainly due to the inhibitory properties of vp35 macrophage infection induces proinflammatory cytokines promotes endothelial leakage and stimulates bystander apoptosis of lymphocytes although the latter does not abrogate the development of a specific cd8 cytotoxic t-cell response expression of tissue factor on the surface of macrophages triggers a coagulation cascade thus promoting hemorrhagedomains on vp35 block the function of the helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 which in concert with melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 are cellular sensors of virus infection and trigger a type i interferon response interestingly the vp35 structures are largely similar between pathogenic ebola virus and the not pathogenic to humans reston virus however the reasons why ebola reston is not pathogenic for humans remain unclear ebola virus vp24 also contributes to the inhibition of innate immunity by preventing the accumulation of antiviral siginal transducers and activators of transcription stat-1 in the nucleus there are some differences between how interferon signaling is suppressed between marburg virus and ebola virus marburg virus blocks both stat-1 and stat-2 activation through the effects of vp40 rather than vp35 as is the case with ebola virus66 recent studies have revealed that lassa virus can also suppress interferon signaling through the c terminal domain of its nucleoprotein which both resembles and functions similar to an endonuclease it can hydrolyze dsrna but not ssrna or dna67 this is the first time a virus has been shown to have dsrna specific exonuclease activity and in addition the first time a virus has been shown to counteract ifn responses by blocking interferon regulatory factor 3 translocation to the nucleus by actually digesting the pathogen-associated molecular patternthere is evidence that ebola and marburg viruses have co-evolved with one or more mammalian reservoirs taylor and colleagues26 have suggested that filoviral gene sequences are present in the genome of small mammals as diverse as shrews and south american marsupials this latter observation indicates that other filoviruses are yet to be discovered in the new world or that south american species harbored ancestral filoviruses that gave rise to present day ebola and marburg virusesoutbreaks of emerging diseases vary widely in duration frequency and case numbers some can be predicted as occurring annually for example influenza whereas many decades may elapse between episodes as is the case with marburg virus planning a single integrated strategy against all eventualities is therefore almost impossible a task compounded by considerations as to likely emergence of escape mutant in populations vaccinated against known diseases the emergence of strains resistant to antiviral therapy or even the recycling through livestock of attenuated vaccines designed for use exclusively in humansimproved epidemiological surveillance of infectious diseases is the foundation for immediate and long-term strategies for combating emerging diseases this needs to be supplemented by adequate training of clinicians and diagnostic microbiologists in all aspects of the control of infectious disease unfortunately cutbacks in available resource have marginalized specific training in emerging infections in many countries as well as limited the availability of containment facilities necessary for the safe handling and characterization of positive isolates this shortfall in capacity is most acute in sub-saharan africa where many serious outbreaks occur although it has to be said that progress has been made most evidently in gabon and uganda where specialized facilities aided by the us centers for disease control now complement local expertise integration with the veterinary community is essential several one medicine programs have been instigated to better serve economically developing nation strengthen their overall capacity to react quickly and effectively in the face of emerging disease outbreaksit is imperative that veterinary scientists are involved in any suspected zoonotic outbreak valuable time was lost in 1999 when the first cases of west nile virus occurred in new york city among both humans and birds68 historically there has been little integration of animal and human public health yet the techniques and methods for diagnosing and controlling infectious disease are similar regardless of affected speciesdifficulties can arise in correctly identifying the cause of a human disease as being zoonotic for many years chronic fatigue syndrome was regarded as being viral in origin a view apparently confirmed when lombardi et al69 reported xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus xmrv as a possible etiological agent this virus was found during a study of human prostate tumor cells that contained integrated dna sequences homologous to retroviruses these workers went on to claim the presence of xmrv in around 100 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome with subsequent estimates of 33 prevalence among blood donors however these results were not reproducible70 and a lack of sequence diversity in presumptive isolates characteristic of retroviruses undergoing transmission from person to person strongly suggested the presence of a contaminant71 this link with xmrv has been retracted but serves to illustrate the inherent difficulties in associating disease with a specific etiological agent objective interpretation of the data was also hindered by public pressure groups frustrated by the scientific communitys apparent lack of progress in defining the cause of chronic fatigue syndrometechnology can play a major role in predicting disease emergence as for example the use of satellite imagery to detect changing patterns of vegetation in response to rainfall the use of satellite maps taken over east africa accurately predicted the outbreak of rfv amongst livestock as a consequence of increased vector activity72 the use of the internet has become an essential tool in containing disease outbreaks allowing for rapid dissemination of serological clinical and molecular sequencing data such rapid communications played a vital role in combating the sars outbreak in 2003 and also in identifying the spread of swine-origin h1n1 influenza virus in 2010time is of the essence in the control of emerging disease outbreaks with delays leading inevitably to an escalation in numbers of cases that can threaten to overwhelm both locally available manpower and capacity73 the immediate closure of hospitals was pivotal in limiting the spread of ebola virus in the original outbreaks in sudan and zaire in 1996 the importance of early recognition and the availability of local expertise has been confirmed recently as this year in uganda where the discovery of the bundibugyo strain of ebola virus in 2000 led to the strengthening of capacity at the virus research institute at entebbe by the us centers for disease control several outbreaks have occurred in uganda over the past decade recent cases of ebola virus in july and august 2012 have been rapidly diagnosed as a result of this regional investment in infrastructure thus preventing its spread to kampala the ugandan capital however outbreaks may spread even in countries fully equipped to deal with infectious disease outbreaks unless there is the foresight to critically review clinical and epidemiological data quickly and instigate the appropriate control measures the slow reaction led in 2003 to the spread of sars virus from hong kong40emergence of new infectious diseases is not a new phenomenon however it is arguably the rate at which new infections are being discovered that has accelerated in the past half century it is some comfort that emerging viruses linked to disease are invariably newly identified member species within well-characterized virus families but this may change as we discover vast numbers of hitherto uncharacterized viruses in what is now commonly referred to as the virosphere indeed it is reckoned by some that viruses represent the largest proportion of biomass on the planet if one takes into account an almost infinite number of viruses in the oceans if this is the case the human immune system does well to protect the species against a constant challenge from viruses constantly mutating and adapting to the environment and ecosystems around usviruses can evolve faster than mammals by many orders of magnitude being near instantaneous compared to the scale of mammalian adaptation over years and decades this may be less so for arthropod-transmitted viruses where the generation time of the vector is measured in weeks if not days thus emergence of vector-borne diseases represent a major threat in the short term once conditions for adaptation result in emergence and an extension of host range as a consequence as was the case for chikungunya virus in 200557predicting the rate of virus evolution is difficult however most approachable is the prediction of single point mutations viruses are over-represented among emerging diseases particularly those with rna genomes as their replication results in a higher rate of mutation compared to those with dna genomes considerable data exists for influenza a viruses for examplehow can the effects of emerging diseases be mitigated a number of criteria need to be addressed table 2 first surveillance is key and for this to be effective there needs to be an effective integration of medical and veterinary public health surveillance systems as vividly illustrated by the incursion of west nile virus into north america in 1999 second effective training in the early diagnosis of disease requires an emphasis on clinicians being skilled in recognizing that the early signs of infection may represent something unique and potentially serious third it is for those that govern communities to recognize and take into account the likely impact of environmental developments on ecosystems and disease emergence taking environmental impact studies beyond conservation of natural habitats and species finally much more needs to be done to understand how viruses overcome the innate immune response when crossing the species barrierconsiderable international effort is now being made to collect and record samples of viruses and microorganisms from wild animal populations and potential arthropod vectors in order to expand the current molecular databases by making available extensive catalogues of genome sequences it is expected that newly emerging agents would in future be more readily identified and thus control measures put in place much more rapidlyonce passage between humans becomes the sole route of transmission a virus can no longer be regarded as causing an emerging disease at this juncture a balance has been found between the evolving viral genome and the ability of the human immune response to limit the infective process thus at any one moment in time many emerging diseases can be viewed as in this process of adaptation prior to reaching the typical hostparasite balance a balance between replication and survival of the hostin the long term however we need to adopt a holistic approach whereby the drivers of emergence are measured in terms of accelerating those processes of adaptation and co-evolution within ecosystems disease emergence is but one manifestation of the challenge the human race has to meet as our environment is threatened by mankinds use of the resources our planet has to offer the only certainty is that as human societies become ever more grouped in cities and impose ever widening environmental change the emergence of new disease threats from unexpected directions will only increase we must think laterally and always expect the unexpectedas the world continues to struggle with the unprecedented ramifications of covid19 two central questions are being asked where did this novel virus come from and how can we prevent future pandemics although there is no definitive answer as to the origins of the virus specialists in the field of immunology and microbiology have suggested that covid19 occurred naturally choudhury 2020 there is significant evidence to suggest that live animal markets or wet markets in wuhan china are the original source of transmission of the virus a major indication is that some of the first patients to test positive for covid19 had connections to the wet markets in wuhan broad 2020 p 3 additionally the causative virus known as sarscov2 is a betacoronavirus that originated in bats much like sars and mers diseases centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2020 an examination into these forms of contagion supports the hypothesis that covid19 potentially transmitted from bats to another susceptible animal such as a pangolin and then to a human choudhury 2020 transmission may have occurred at the wildlife market or while en route to the wildlife market where illicitly traded wildlife may be sold it is currently unknown as to precisely how the virus was transmitted from animals to humans but the threat of bats spreading disease has been a longheld concern for public health officials and biological researchers viruses that are transmitted from animals to humans are very dangerous to human life due to the absence of herd immunity among the population this article will explore the connections among the current pandemic liveanimal markets the spread of animalrelated diseases and the illicit wildlife trade and will include a set of policy recommendations prescribed to prevent future outbreaks stemming from these issuesto explore the connections between bats and covid19 we reviewed academic literature and scientific journals on bat ecology and conservation emerging zoonotic diseases the covid19 outbreak and wet markets in china we used websites of authoritative bodies such as the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the world health organization who we looked at scholarship and reports addressing the illicit wildlife trade from prominent intergovernmental organizations and nongovernmental organizations such as the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc and traffic we also reviewed reporting from news media outlets such as the new york times and the wall street journalalthough it could be several years before any final conclusions are drawn on the origins of the covid19 outbreak there is still substantial evidence that it originated in bats biological and epidemiological research indicates that different species of bats may potentially carry multiple strands of the virus very similar to that of the current coronavirus the los angeles times stated scientists estimate that 3 out of 4 new or emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals su 2020at the institute of virology in china a horseshoe bat rhinolophus affinis identified as ratg13 was discovered to be carrying a form of coronavirus which shared 96 of its dna with sarscov2 ridley 2020 although this information provides compelling circumstantial evidence it does not prove that this particular species of bat contributed to or assisted in the spread of covid19 however this does not mean that another species of bat does not carry this form of coronavirus that can then be shared with humans in perspective humans share 96 of our genome with chimpanzees bat conservation trust 2020 experts are not certain as to how sarscov2 was transmitted to humans it may have been transmitted through another susceptible animal such as a pangolin the most illegally traded mammal in the world conciatore 2019past research has shown that bats are central to the dissemination of covidlike diseases among animals and humans although rodents bear the responsibility for spreading the bubonic plague during the fourteenth century bats present a unique danger as reservoirs for zoonotic viruses hosting even more bacteria and diseases than rodents luis et al 2013 p 3 therefore bats have been much studied as transmitters of viruses to humans through close contact or direct consumption humans cause harm to bats not only through consumption but also by contributing to their loss of habitat as a consequence of environmental destruction bats seek new areas to feed sometimes causing them to come into contact with livestock that will be eventually sold in open markets plowright et al 2015 pp 34 additionally habitat destruction can cause bats to shed and contract more viruses further increasing the likelihood that they will transmit disease olival 2016 p 7 bats are frequently stored and sold in wet markets and are often transported alongside large groups of uncommon and illicitly traded animals that are consumed by humans this form of transportation and storage allows the spread of pathogens between bats and different sometimes exotic and rare creatures that can carry and advance diseases under severe stressful situationsthe concern over pathogens being transferred from bats to humans is widespread not only among public health professionals but also has been much studied by academics the american society for microbiology published a report entitled identification of a novel coronavirus in bats which stated the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus sarscov highlights the importance of virus surveillance in wild animals poon et al 2005 p 2001 it further explains the identification of severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus sarscov in civet cats and other wild animals in live animal markets suggests that this novel human pathogen emerged as a result of an interspecies transmission poon et al 2005 p 2001 this report illustrates how other coronaviruslike illnesses in animals have been previously identified as potential sources of transmission to humans in fact this is not a recent discovery and concerns existed already in 2007 that there was a serious danger to human life a university of hong kong study at that time found that the presence of a large reservoir of sarscovlike viruses in horseshoe bats together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern china is a time bomb cheng lau woo  yuen 2007 p 638 indeed this warning was unheeded and the failure to act on this insight has contributed to the most serious global pandemic in a centurythis global health crisis originating from zoonotic transmission is not novel in fact over the last 20 years several deadly diseases are thought to have originated from live animal or wet markets wet markets are where fresh meats produce and animals are often stored to be sold in openair environments in close proximity with little to no health safety precautions or sanitation measures these wet markets exist across the world and in china they often contain foreign rare and sometimes endangered species that are sold among other goods by traveling suppliers wet markets facilitate and heavily contribute to the practice of illicit wildlife trade and in turn this practice has led to the spread of zoonotic diseases among the animals and to customers at markets transportation and storage of animals for wildlife trade at these markets enables the spread of diseases from animals to other animalsas one science writer reports live meat markets are perfect laboratories for creating new viruses stressed animals shed more viruses and are more susceptible to infections and cages are often stacked on top of each other facilitating exposure nuwer 2020 exotic meats that are traded illegally such as pangolins are less likely to be inspected for health risks and may come into contact with bats while in transit additionally because these rare animals are often from remote areas they may be more likely to carry diseases that humans have never come into contact with hemley 2020 the conditions the live animals are subjected to in wet markets create a petri dish for the spread of diseasesin china and in some other asian countries these markets are prevalent because consumers view wet markets as fresher not expensive and providing rare types of creatures that serve as status symbols or are believed to possess unique healing elements daszak olival  li 2020 p 7 yet the spread of disease from the live and exotic animals represents the biggest threatfor instance wild carnivores birds reptiles and primates that are traded in these markets carry pathogens from every taxonomic origin therefore pathogens such as newcastle disease can jump from wild to domestic birds and pathogens such as simian foamy virus and chlamydophila psittaci can be transmitted from wild animals to humans gmez  aguirre 2008 p 17 there is a welldocumented history of regional and even global pandemics originating from the transmission of diseases from animals to humans due to the practice of wet markets and illegal wildlife traffickingin april 2020 the united nations un acting head of biodiversity stated countries should move to prevent future pandemics by banning wet markets that sell live and dead animals for human consumption but cautioned against unintended consequences greenfield 2020 public health officials in the united states and around the world have pointed to wet markets and illegal wildlife trading as conduits for the transfer of disease the transference of diseases from animals to humans may transpire through the consumption proximity or mixing of animals or their byproducts typically animals are susceptible to different types of diseases once a strand is introduced into the human population it can be spread from human to human and cause an outbreak or potential public health emergency relatively recent epidemics such as ebola middle east respiratory syndrome mers bird flu severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and swine flu are all examples of diseases that have originated through the transfer of disease to humans from animals for example the highly pathogenic asian avian influenza a h5n1 virus or bird flu is highly contagious and it occurs when humans come into direct or close contact with infected or already diseased poultry cdc 2018 therefore the significant risk factors for infection include visiting or mixing animals in live poultry markets similarly while the swine flu is sporadic in humans infections are typically the result of exposure to infected pigs within live markets fairs or the pork industry cdc 2019aunfortunately due to the nature of infections there is still a lot of information left unknown about how some of these outbreaks originated in the case of ebola and based on the analyses of similar viruses scientists believe it is animalborne with bats or nonhuman primates such as apes or chimpanzees being the most likely source cdc 2019b another example would be in 2003 when sars broke out in the southern province of guangdong in china experts believe this outbreak is the result of an unknown animal reservoir some experts have suggested bats and the spread occurred through other animals such as civet cats world health organization who 2020 during its initial outbreak sars resulted in more than 8000 cases in over 25 countries similar to sars mers began as the result of a zoonotic virus in saudi arabia although different practices other than wet markets or animal reservoirs led to the outbreak of mers the method of transfer is the same animal to human who 2019 the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases dr anthony fauci insisted on a global closure of wet markets because the current crisis is a direct result of this practice guzman 2020 after the sars outbreak china attempted to institute a similar more stringent ban on wildlife trade but this has eroded over time su 2020 several conservationists and medical professionals including members of the chinese academy of sciences hoped this ban would be permanent but the markets and trade routes returned after the crisis ended who 2020 it is certain that without cooperative comprehensive and enforced policies on wildlife trade and of endangered species such as the pangolin in place there will continue to be a spread of global sickness and international loss of lifeglobal law enforcement to address the illegal trading in exotic animals for consumption or possession represents a high priority in preventing future animal to human disease transmission to address this problem countering illicit wildlife trade must be a higher priority of interpol the international police body and of regional and law enforcement bodies but this trade is highly linked to transnational crime that requires corruption to operate therefore there needs to be much more attention paid to dismantling crossnational illicit networks addressing corruption and following the money linked to this trade moreover the role of corporate actors as part of the supply chain for this illicit transit needs much more attention much illicit wildlife trade flows through freetrade zones in asia and they must be held much more responsible for the cargo that goes through their ports shelley 2018 p 193a targeted ban could be effective and have fewer unintended consequences than an outright ban focusing on the most likely vectors of zoonotic diseases could protect public health without the negative effects of a blanket ban although a ban on wild animal and wet markets would lower the number of opportunities for chinese consumers to come into contact with meat infected with infectious agents there is the chance that underground markets will pop up therefore allowing the sale of a limited category of meat in markets as the chinese government is now considering would preserve peoples access to food an overarching ban could destroy these peoples livelihoods or even lead to a black market facilitated by corruption with even greater risks samuel 2020 enforcement of regulations are essential and inspections must be carried out to ensure that meat from exotic animals is not disguised as meat from domestic animalsthere are certain aspects of this pandemic that might make a total ban on wet markets politically viable the markets in china were closed temporarily after the sars outbreak in 2003 though this ban did not last long samuel 2020 this time might be different however the sars outbreak resulted in around 800 deaths worldwide while the death toll from covid19 has caused over 432000 deaths as of june 15 2020 with the recommendations of experts and the drastic toll of covid19 shutting down the wet markets may be politically possibleeven if wildlife markets are banned outreach will be necessary to drive down demand for a black market consumption of wild animals from wet markets is influenced by chinese and asian culture which holds that wild animals and their byproducts have healing powers eating rare animals has also become a status symbol signifying that the consumer is wealthy daszak et al 2020 p 7 in addition chinese culture places a great deal of emphasis on the freshness of the food being consumed this concept of freshness extends to perceptions of food quality healthiness and taste with fresher always being better food from a grocery store is seen as less fresh than food from wet markets some chinese consumers will make trips to easily accessible wet markets every day zhong crang  zeng 2020 p 179dealing with the underground markets will require convincing people that they should not buy from underground wet markets this could be done through public health outreach campaigns that inform people of the dangers of exotic meats and markets that have live wild animals research has shown that public health outreach campaigns can work the first antismoking campaign given federal funds by the united states government showed impressive results inspiring 18 million smokers to attempt to quit and 104000 to quit for good in 2014 cdc 2016 although there are crucial differences between cigarettes and meats from animal markets in terms of addiction and their places in different cultures the concept may have applicability in convincing people not to buy food from wild animal marketsfuture research by the health medical and environmental community must be combined with research on illicit trade and corruption a transdisciplinary approach has been taken in the one health perspective but this approach has not gone outside the scientific perspective aguirre et al 2019 wilcox aguirre de padua siriaroonrat  echaubard 2019 going forward these barriers among academic disciplines must be bridged to consider all the risks to public healthaddressing and preventing pandemics requires an array of transdisciplinary research research must focus on the central causes of the spread of zoonotic diseases such as illicit wildlife trade and wet markets public health conservation biology and illicit trade scholars should collaborate on addressing the facets of supply chains corruption and trade that may contribute to zoonotic transmission there will need to be much more work with the business community to follow the supply chains linked to illicit trade in wildlife governments will need to get involved as well and take action to suppress the wildlife trade in order to prevent future outbreaksthose who are part of the illicit wildlife trade have not taken off days during this crisis lockdown policies and the changing dynamics of international travel have resulted in multiple changes to the supply chains for illicit wildlife trade trade by air has been slowed due to quarantine regulations and transportation by road has been complicated by roadblocks and checkpoints particularly at borders the trade is still happening by sea however additionally because governments have closed so many national parks poachers have taken the opportunity to go after animals that are not being as closely guarded as before the combination of transportation difficulties and unwatched national parks has led to stockpiling of products in the illicit wildlife trade without addressing these issues now the trade could come roaring back as lockdowns are lifted wildlife justice commission 2020 p 5this outbreak was caused by an array of factors including the conditions of wet markets the illicit wildlife trade and environmental destruction a multipronged approach will be necessary to make sure this never happens again on the illegal trade aspect policymakers will need to address the source of demand for these products the wet markets shutting down the wet markets or at least strictly regulating them and banning the sale of live wild animals will be necessary to address the problem of zoonotic diseases hopefully this pandemic will convince government officials that these markets need to be dealt with and convince scholars to study the intersection of illicit trade and public healthconflicts of interest none declaredcovid-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus which has first been originated in wuhan city hubei provinces of china 1 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is a new type of virus family that has not been earlier identified in people the virus seems to be transmitted mostly through the minute respiratory droplets via coughing sneezing or when people interact with each other for some time in close proximity these droplets can then be inhaled or they can land on surfaces that others may come into touch with who can then get contaminate when they contact their eyes mouth or nosethe novel coronavirus can live on different surface like few days stainless steel and plastic and few hours cardboard and copper however the amount of viable virus declines over time and may not always be present in sufficient numbers to cause infection in humans the symptoms of this virus can be experienced in between 1 to 14 days from the day of infection from then it has been spreading at the speed of knots giving no time to prepare against a newly identified infectious and notorious virus which have compelled the who to declare covid-19 as a pandemic 3 due to its fast human to human transmission and people got infected in every continent and it had already taken so many lives the statistics and graph for increasing cases active cases have been shown in the figure 1
 symptoms of coronavirus change in severity from having no symptoms at all being asymptomatic to having fatigue cough fever general weakness sore throatmuscular pain and in the most extreme cases sepsis severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndromeand septic shock all potentially leading to death reports show that clinical deterioration can occur quickly often during the 14 days of disease of late anosmia loss of the sense of smell have been reported as a one of the symptom of a coronavirus infection there is already conformation from many regions such as italy china and south korea that patients with committed sars-cov-2 infection have developed anosmiahyposmia in some cases in the absence of any other symptoms still there is no proper treatment drugs or vaccine for coronavirus disease several random drugs are being tried to target the virus on severely affected coronavirus patients however the use of these need to be more carefully assessed in randomized controlled trialsseveral clinical trials are ongoing to assess their effectiveness but results are not yet available as this is a new virus no vaccine is currently available although work on a vaccine has already started by several research groups and pharmaceutical companies worldwide it may be months to more than a year before a vaccine has been tested and is ready for use in humans 5 till today covid-19 has been infected the citizens of more than 212 countries leads to 3747356 patients out of which 258970 people had lost their lives and 1250693 people 6 gets recovered but due to the virus bi-phasic nature there may be chances of infection again in those recovered casesdue to an insufficient number of test kits ventilators oxygen tanks hospital beds and unavailability of proper treatment or vaccine it is very important to analyze the growth rates of positive cases number of recoveries and other factors that affect the growth of this virus to the same extent proper arrangements can be made to prevent losses of lives and to have proper insights of the condition for example based on the analysis of data the government can have the prior information to the number of cases till a particular day and before that day they can arrange all the necessary medical equipment or which mitigations to be done to prevent losses of lives nowadays machine learning methods have been widely used in healthcare field 7 8 and for having much faster and efficient prediction of covid-19 infected personin this work the support vector regression svr 9 10 11 model is used to solve the four different types of covid-19 related problems the proposed method will be fitted into the dataset containing the total number of covid19 positive cases and the number of recoveries for different countries like mainland china us italy south korea and india and with the help of the proposed method to predict the future number of total cases active cases and recoveries these tasks can help a countryregion to understand the spreading of the virus facilitateaware people start mitigations itll also help that regioncountry to be prepared for whats will happen in the future which may help in saving lives and agony and compare proposed method results with other well know regression models such as simple linear regression polynomial regression 12 and another task containing the weather data for regions like new york citynyc and milano italy to analyze the correlation between different weather parameters and the total number of cases pearsons method is used this will help in understanding the effects of weather conditions on the virus spreadsupport vector machines svm 15 is a supervised learning algorithm this algorithm is used for classification and regression problems svr is based on the same principles as svm for classification ie to find a hyperplane in a d-dimensional space d is the number of features that uniquely classifies the data points svr uses a non-parametric technique which means the output from the svr model does not depend on distributions of the dependent and independent variables svr technique is basically dependent on kernel functions which allows for the construction of a non-linear model without changing the explanatory variables which helps in better interpretation of the resultant model in these algorithms a hyperplane is found that separates the different features the produced model by svm does not depend on the training points that lie outside the margin but instead depends on a subset of the training data as the cost function similarly in svr support vectors find the closest data points and the actual function represented by them we get closest to the actual curve if the distance between the support vectors to the regressed curve is maximuma hyperplane is a function that classifies the points in a higher dimension or other words hyperplanes are the boundaries that help in the classification of the data points if the margin for any hyperplane is maximum then that hyperplane is the optimal hyperplane the points which are closest to hyperplane are called support vector points and the distance of the vectors from the hyperplane are called the margins as shown in figure 2
farther the support vector points from the hyperplane more is the probability that the points will be correctively classified in their respective region or classes thus the equation of the hyperplane in the d dimension can be given as1zl011x1l2x2l3x3l0i1nlixil0l1txbl1txwhere lil0l1l2
b  biased term l
0 and x  variables kernel is an important part of svr the kernel is a way of computing the dot product of two vectors x and y in some high dimensional feature space kernel trick is used in svr which simply means to replace the dot product of two vectors by the kernel functionthe outbreak of covid-19 is developing into a major international crisis and its starting to influence important aspects of daily life for example bans have been placed on hotspot countries international manufacturing operations have often had to throttle back production and many goods solely produced in china have been halted altogether in highly affected areas people are starting to stock up on essential goods such that in order to predict how the virus could spread across different countries and regions different regression models were to be used to predict the total number of positive cases the main goal of this task was to build and compare regression models that can predict the progression of the total positive covid 19 cases from different regions that may help mitigation efforts the advantage of doing this would be that we will have an idea about the number that will reach of many cases this will give the idea about the level of spread and in accordance to that the government and the citizens can make proper plans to handle the situation by taking measures to minimize the virus spread by various mitigation and other necessary actions predicting total number of cases in different regions are show in figure 3

discovered it is important to see how many of the patients will recover from this virus and how and when the epidemic will end the main objective of this task was to predict how many people were going to recover based on old recovery recordssuch that in order to predict how many people will actually recover records for the number of recovered patients across different countries were taken the goal of solving this task helps us to understand how the epidemic will end ie how many patients will recover the advantage of doing this would be that we will have an idea about the number of patients that will recover from the infection from the older known methods since no vaccine or cure is yet discovered and by predicting the time that will be taken by all the patients to recover we will be able to understand how much time will it take to for this pandemic to endto prepare the dataset for this task firstly dates were converted to day number taking 22 jan 2020 as day 1 and 24 april 2020 as day 93 then total number recoveries till that day were extracted region wise in order of day number next the day number and recovery counts were scaled to observe clearer results for different affected countries a linear regression and a polynomial regression model was fitted and visualized to the dataset to predict the number of recoveries of affected patients in that particular region in the

shapecovid-19 causes illness in humans and creates severe damage in the lungs however covid-19 has killed many people in the entire world in this paper we are proposing the support vector regression method based navel coronavirus analysis on five different tasks main novelty in this work is instead of simple regression line we use supported vectors also to get better classification accuracythe main advantage of doing the first task would be that this will give the idea about the level of spread and in accordance to that the government and the citizens can make proper plans to handle the situation by taking measures to minimize the virus spread by various mitigation and other necessary actions with the help of second task will have an idea about how well the mitigations are working and the actions that are taken till date how effective are they or how many cases have been prevented by this the advantage of doing third task would be that we will have an idea about the number of patients that will recover from the infection from the older known methods since no vaccine or cure is yet discovered and by predicting the time that will be taken by all the patients to recover we will be able to understand how much time will it take to for this pandemic to end with fourth task we will be able to observe and analyze how fast or slow the virus is spreading among regions therefore which areas needs more attention or not finally fifth task create better surroundings for the infected patient to reduce the spread the people can also be warned if they should avoid humidity or not and high temperature or no pearsons correlation method gives a clear understanding of the correlation between the spread and weather conditions in all tasks the proposed support vector

impact of the novel coronavirus covid-19 an infectious disease the digital transformation of work styles around the world is progressing faster than ever with corona and looking ahead to after corona corporate strategies all over the world face major transformations in these circumstances the digital shift transformation in the historical nature of work styles has been garnering a lot of attention with demands for it rising in societies while the spread of iot ai 5 g cloud services etc is further accelerating this digital transformation kodama 2019notably the global scale of the spread of infections of the novel coronavirus have increased demands for cloud services all over the world notable in this expansion is the demands for video conferencing tools which are indispensable for telework for example interest in online learning eg kodama 2000 2001b and online healthcare eg kodama 2001a 2002 is rapidly increasing while the implementation of telework and online seminars etc is rapidly progressing - after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus the stock price of zoom nasdaq zm a video conferencing software developer rose sharplyin china ali baba offered chat and video conferencing services to 10 million companies free of charge and increased its memberships to 200 million other companies such as tencent bytedance that offers tiktok and baidu provide telework tools for free to over 18 million companies with a total of more than 300 million people teleworking in this way demand for video conferencing tools has skyrocketed all over the world - downloads of zoom in the second week of march 2020 were 14 times higher in the united states 20 times higher in the uk 27 times higher in spain and 55 times higher in italy compared to the average downloads per week in the fourth quarter of the last yearfrom before the outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid-19 to the present after the 2003 sars outbreak to the present the authors research team analyzed the use of collaboration systems such as various video conferencing tools and business chat in global corporations in europe the united states and asia that use these systems proactively through qualitative research methods such as ethnography participant observation action research and in-depth case studiesprior research has shown that various it-related functions for information management it infrastructure and planning can bring performance benefits to businesses eg lu  ramamurthy 2011 mithas ramasubbu  sambamurthy 2011 although there has not been any detailed reportage on the various effects on business of particular it applications such as collaboration systemsthis article proposes new knowledge and research and practical implications from four research streams for exploratory research on the forms of usage and business effects business process reform such as product development supply chain reform decision making process reform knowledge management new business model creation etc of collaboration systems entailing a high degree of interaction communications collaboration etc among people and organizationsthe use of collaboration systems is spreading all over the world with typical corporate and organizational it applications such as business chat slack microsoft teams etc cloud services zoom spark skype for business etc video conferencing systems web conferencing systems and unified communications ucnotably collaboration system video communications functions have been included in iphone facetime and various social networking services and can be seen across not only the b2b and b2c areas but also widely in c2c as shown in fig 1
 various collaboration systems are positioned on two factorfunctional axes video and audio quality and cost vs level of media integration these systems have common functions for video communications information sharing and groupware calling etc in this product positioning corporations organizations that pursue agility and efficiency in business processes skillfully use these systems depending on the characteristics of their business portfoliosin particular in the business education healthcare and welfare fields new forms of services are beginning to become popular that entail the use of interactive video communications eg clifton jo longo  malone 2017 du plessis 2008 dub bourhis  jacob 2006 maher  prescott 2017 piotrowski  robertson 2017 zournazis  marlow 2015 video communications offer high-potential communications methods that hold promise for application in a wide range of fields from corporations through to families and individuals - not only do they faithfully convey image information but have also long held promise as methods of personal expression and as usage in the education healthcare and welfare fields or even for fusion with art etc eg kodama 1999  in addition in the era of global 5 g mobile telecommunications systems there are also hopes for these video communications functions as crucial broadband communications platforms for generating new virtual and video businesses using ai and ioton the marketing side the use of collaboration systems such as video conferencing tools has become increasingly popular for various reasons such as facilitating global business speeding up work in dispersed projects sharing information inside and outside of companies speeding up decision-making human resource development by conveying or passing on certain skills and know-how as well as improving motivation by facilitating telework and emergency measures for natural disasters etc eg bond-barnard fletcher  steyn 2016 garca-lvarez 2015 wolfe 2007conversely on the technical side technical developments such as the spread of broadband such as the new 5 g mobile telecommunications systems voip and multimedia over ip lower costs the emergence of simple video conferencing systems and video conferencing software higher image quality and higher functionality hd telepresence 4 k 8 k etc a variety of mobile terminals smartphones tablets etc unified communications uc cloud services and aiiotvr have also caused video conferencing tools to spreadthese synergistic effects between the market and technology sides have further reduced the costs of collaboration system products services and communications including video conferencing tools which driven expansion of usage by users resulting in further cost reduction and market expansion - positive feedback triggered by these network effects kodama 2007 2009 see fig 2
in information system is research covering it applications which are these collaboration systems the relationship between it and business process agility has been taken up as a key research theme luftman et al 2013 roberts  grover 2012 prior research has shown that various it-related functions for information management it infrastructure and planning can bring performance benefits to businesses eg lu  ramamurthy 2011 mithas et al 2011 moreover there has also been a focus on the impacts on business process agility of it resources and capabilities and their resultant impacts on business performance chen et al 2014 tallon  pinsonneault 2011it capabilities are the ability to mobilize and deploy it-based resources in combination or copresent with other resources and capabilities bharadwaj 2000 p 171 and as mentioned in prior research various aspects of it functions security and risk management communication data management application infrastructure it equipment management and it architecture have been studied a series of empirical studies in prior research have shown that it functions are an important enabler of corporate performance eg chen et al 2014 kim shin kim  lee 2011 mithas et al 2011 queiroz tallon sharma  coltman 2018in contrast much research has argued that the main impacts of it occur at the business process level and those impacts can be aggregated to the corporate level barua kriebel  mukhopadhyay 1995 melville kraemer  gurbaxani 2004 mithas et al 2011 setia sambamurthy  closs 2008 tallon 2007 this suggests that it process-level impacts are important in understanding the relationship between it functionality and corporate performancealso some studies have reported that technical it skills and it infrastructure flexibility do not affect process performance ray muhanna  barney 2005 this research states that shared knowledge impacts process performance and further relaxes the links between it technology and process performance shared knowledge is developed and accumulated by organizations over a long period thus a shared body of firm-specific knowledge able to effectively utilize new it applications eg video conferencing tools takes years to evolve into numerous joint development projects therefore the development of shared knowledge is a path-dependent socially complex processaccordingly such knowledge is valuable as the essence of building it capabilities and as long as it is unevenly spread among companies it has the potential to be an important factor in differentiating it capabilities because it cannot be imitated at low cost this research suggests the importance of the knowledge-based view eg grant 1996 nonaka  takeuchi 1995 of knowledge management etc in analysis of it capabilitiesin addition kodama 2013a  who discusses the relationship between in-house and external usage of video conferencing tools it applications with knowledge communities offers 2 insights first is the diverse communications and collaboration effects of video conferencing tools real-time communications and collaboration functions which combine and modify video voice and data bring about unique usage forms and structures in a company accordingly video conferencing tools promote the learning process which increases the frequency and type of meetings and the number of temporary meetings and meetings outside companies for specific projects etcsecond is the formation of new business networks and the promotion of knowledge creation activities nonaka  takeuchi 1995 with the implementation of video conferencing tools brand new dialogue and meetings begin new information flows and practitioners are moved to practical activities video conferencing tools increase meetings and facilitate the flattening of in-house organizations also as video conferencing tools enable communications without the participants having to physically go to a predetermined meeting location they enable design of new business networks that are free of constraints on speech ba and communities of practice in particular it has been clarified that regular meeting bodies develop into knowledge communities such as communities of practice weinger 1999 dependent on specific contexts and that video conferencing tools facilitate the formation maintenance and development of knowledge communities inside and outside of companies kodama 2020however kodama 2013a 2013b does not clarify the characteristics of knowledge communities that use video conferencing tools the kinds of strategic and organizational contexts in which these knowledge communities use these tools how new business networks are formed or how knowledge creation activities are facilitated nevertheless from the theoretical and practical perspectives there is great significance in clarifying how video conferencing tools usage has positive effects on knowledge creation and more broadly knowledge management in what strategic and organizational contexts and with what type of it capabilities the micro organization view as the community-based view eg kodama 2013b wenger 1999 which is organizational analysis at the micro level has been suggested as important in this researchexisting research to date has focused on functional competencies especially management capabilities related to it infrastructure eg it infrastructure functions and infrastructure services such as security and risk management communications data management it equipment management it architecture etc however as it infrastructure has become commoditized it can no longer be a differentiating factor for companies eg bhatt  grover 2005little attention has been paid to researching it application-related functions such as video conferencing tools nor attention paid to how businesses can profit from it applications nazir  pinsonneault 2012 however even it applications that enable companies to differentiate themselves tend to lose value quickly due to market changes the fast pace of it innovation and shortened it application lifecycles ross weill  robertson 2006 vessey  ward 2013in such circumstances to realize the real benefits of it companies must build new it application portfolios that entail the positioning and utilization forms of various video conferencing tools as shown in fig 1 and pour continuous efforts into developing new systems and applications with new usage forms kappelman mclean johnson  torres 2016 luftman et al 2012 2013however it is mostly unclear how capabilities of corporations utilizing it applications such as video conferencing tools affect agility efficiency and even creativity and to what degree agility impacts on corporate performance research on the impacts of it capabilities on new product development npd eg pavlou  el sawy 2006 is consistent with the aforementioned argument that the main impact of it occurs at the process level and shows that competitive advantage for npd is related to it-enabled dynamic capabilities teece 2007 and functional competenciesvarious existing research to date has examined the functional competencies of it although there is very little research on dynamic it capabilities using it applications such as video conferencing tools that have a high potential to enable corporate differentiation strategy koch 2010 pavlou  el sawy 2011 roberts  grover 2012 notably almost nothing is known about the impacts of it-enabled dynamic capabilities for video conferencing tools on process-level outcomes such as business process agility and efficiency accordingly it is suggested that the micro strategy view as the dynamic capabilities view teece 2007 2014 teece pisano  shuen 1997 is important for the analysis of it capabilitiesin light of the above prior research reviews this article identifies some important remaining research issues - specifically the following three points1prior research on it applications has been limited to investigation at the macro corporate or business unit level2prior research does not clarify how it capabilities impact agility or efficiency or creativity at the micro organizational level or at the team or business community level nor does it clarify the mechanics of how changes to agility are brought about at the micro process level3it tools investigated in prior research cover a wide range of technical fields such as infrastructure systems and application systems but prior research does not clarify specifically what types of individual it tools eg collaboration systems such as video conferencing tools are involved in the above contexts of 1 and 2
therefore from the above perspectives as a new approach to research of it capabilities longitudinal process level analysis and consideration of micro-it strategies and organizational dynamism that integrate the four research streams of not only the conventional information system-view but also the aforementioned knowledge-based micro organization community-based and micro strategy views the dynamic capabilities view are requiredin light of existing research to date as a new perspective in this era of infectious disease confronting humanity that cannot be avoided this article proposes the necessity to explore the business and social impacts of collaboration systems such as video conferencing tools - important corporate it applications that have a high potential to bring about differentiation strategies in particular it capabilities to effectively utilize video conferencing tools at the micro process level of organizations and teams business community level must be clarified because collaboration systems greatly affect the business processes and knowledge sharing of people and organizations community level and furthermore greatly affect innovation as knowledge creation activitiesas a future research approach from the perspective of integrating the four research streams of the main prior research of the micro strategy-view eg dynamic capabilities framework exploitation and exploration micro organization-view eg communities of practice strategic communities knowledge-based view eg knowledge creation knowledge integration knowledge boundaries and information systems-view it capabilities it will be necessary to extract a new theoretical framework and knowledge by clarifying it capabilities black boxing see fig 3
 the integration of these four research streams will be extremely important in clarifying black boxing of the micro-strategic and organizational dynamism of it-enabled dynamic capabilities and more broadly it-enabled capabilities this black boxing has not been clarified in detail in prior research with its focus on quantitative studies using statistical analysisthe idea that companies incorporate it applications such as collaboration systems into the core of their it strategy not only to transform their businesses but also to generate new business models will become increasingly important over the long term in this era of infectious diseases facing humanity the it capabilities of companies that utilize it applications to innovate business and bring about new business models are not limited to the technical functions such as hardware and software of it applications but are heavily reliant on the knowledge especially intangible assets possessed by people and organizations kodama 2013aput differently the most important sources of lasting competitive advantage for most companies are not it applications themselves but condensed wisdom as the high-level knowledge of ideas know-how and skills to develop combine and use new it applicationsknowledge is also the dynamic capabilities eg kodama 2018 2019 teece 2007 2014 that underpin dynamic innovation activities to continuously bring about new creations while it applications themselves are the methods of acquiring various new knowledge and achieving innovation in other words capabilities that enable people and organizations to generate new knowledge through interaction with it applications are driving forces that maximize the use of it applications transform business and bring about new business innovationas practical implications this article proposes that clarification of the usage patterns and management effects of it applications such as collaboration systems will help companies to generate and develop it-enabled knowledge communities kodama 2013b within and between companies including customers and bring about strengthened corporate competitiveness in practice strategic use of collaboration systems has the potential to facilitate corporate exploration activities and enhance the creativity of people and organizations on the other hand strategic use of these systems also has the potential to facilitate enhanced speed efficiency and upgrades and improvements of existing knowledge utilization in corporate exploitation activitiescorporations organizations must take the with corona and after corona environments as an opportunity for self-transformation and further drive digital transformation of work styles this article has proposed new knowledge research and practical implications integrating four research streams for exploratory research on the usage forms and business effects of collaboration systems which have a high degree of interaction with humans and organizationscoronaviruses covs are the largest group of viruses belonging to the nidovirales order which includes coronaviridae arteriviridae mesoniviridae and roniviridae families the coronavirinae comprise one of two subfamilies in the coronaviridae family with the other being the torovirinae the coronavirinae are further subdivided into four genera the alpha beta gamma and delta coronaviruses the viruses were initially sorted into these genera based on serology but are now divided by phylogenetic clusteringall viruses in the nidovirales order are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses they all contain very large genomes for rna viruses with some viruses having the largest identified rna genomes containing up to 335 kilobase kb genomes other common features within the nidovirales order include 1 a highly conserved genomic organization with a large replicase gene preceding structural and accessory genes 2 expression of many non-structural genes by ribosomal frameshifting 3 several unique or unusual enzymatic activities encoded within the large replicasetranscriptase polyprotein and 4 expression of downstream genes by synthesis of 3 nested sub-genomic mrnas in fact the nidovirales order name is derived from these nested 3 mrnas as nido is latin for nest the major differences within the nidovirus families are in the number type and sizes of the structural proteins these differences cause significant alterations in the structure and morphology of the nucleocapsids and virionscoronaviruses contain a non-segmented positive-sense rna genome of 30 kb the genome contains a 5 cap structure along with a 3 poly a tail allowing it to act as an mrna for translation of the replicase polyproteins the replicase gene encoding the non-structural proteins nsps occupies two-thirds of the genome about 20 kb as opposed to the structural and accessory proteins which make up only about 10 kb of the viral genome the 5 end of the genome contains a leader sequence and untranslated region utr that contains multiple stem loop structures required for rna replication and transcription additionally at the beginning of each structural or accessory gene are transcriptional regulatory sequences trss that are required for expression of each of these genes see subheading 43 on rna replication the 3 utr also contains rna structures required for replication and synthesis of viral rna the organization of the coronavirus genome is 5-leader-utr-replicase-s spike-e envelope-m membrane-n nucleocapsid-3 utr-poly a tail with accessory genes interspersed within the structural genes at the 3 end of the genome fig 1 the accessory proteins are almost exclusively nonessential for replication in tissue culture however some have been shown to have important roles in viral pathogenesis 1
coronavirus virions are spherical with diameters of approximately 125 nm as depicted in recent studies by cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy 2 3 the most prominent feature of coronaviruses is the club-shaped spike projections emanating from the surface of the virion these spikes are a defining feature of the virion and give them the appearance of a solar corona prompting the name coronaviruses within the envelope of the virion is the nucleocapsid coronaviruses have helically symmetrical nucleocapsids which is uncommon among positive-sense rna viruses but far more common for negative-sense rna virusescoronavirus particles contain four main structural proteins these are the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins all of which are encoded within the 3 end of the viral genome the s protein 150 kda utilizes an n-terminal signal sequence to gain access to the er and is heavily n-linked glycosylated homotrimers of the virus encoded s protein make up the distinctive spike structure on the surface of the virus 4 5 the trimeric s glycoprotein is a class i fusion protein 6 and mediates attachment to the host receptor 7 in most coronaviruses s is cleaved by a host cell furin-like protease into two separate polypeptides noted s1 and s2 8 9 s1 makes up the large receptor-binding domain of the s protein while s2 forms the stalk of the spike molecule 10the m protein is the most abundant structural protein in the virion it is a small 2530 kda protein with three transmembrane domains 11 and is thought to give the virion its shape it has a small n-terminal glycosylated ectodomain and a much larger c-terminal endodomain that extends 68 nm into the viral particle 12 despite being co-translationally inserted in the er membrane most m proteins do not contain a signal sequence recent studies suggest the m protein exists as a dimer in the virion and may adopt two different conformations allowing it to promote membrane curvature as well as to bind to the nucleocapsid 13the e protein 812 kda is found in small quantities within the virion the coronavirus e proteins are highly divergent but have a common architecture 14 the membrane topology of e protein is not completely resolved but most data suggest that it is a transmembrane protein the e protein has an n-terminal ectodomain and a c-terminal endodomain and has ion channel activity as opposed to other structural proteins recombinant viruses lacking the e protein are not always lethal although this is virus type dependent 15 the e protein facilitates assembly and release of the virus see subheading 44 but also has other functions for instance the ion channel activity in sars-cov e protein is not required for viral replication but is required for pathogenesis 16the n protein constitutes the only protein present in the nucleocapsid it is composed of two separate domains an n-terminal domain ntd and a c-terminal domain ctd both capable of binding rna in vitro but each domain uses different mechanisms to bind rna it has been suggested that optimal rna binding requires contributions from both domains 17 18 n protein is also heavily phosphorylated 19 and phosphorylation has been suggested to trigger a structural change enhancing the affinity for viral versus nonviral rna n protein binds the viral genome in a beads-on-a-string type conformation two specific rna substrates have been identified for n protein the trss 20 and the genomic packaging signal 21 the genomic packaging signal has been found to bind specifically to the second or c-terminal rna binding domain 22 n protein also binds nsp3 18 23 a key component of the replicase complex and the m protein 24 these protein interactions likely help tether the viral genome to the replicasetranscriptase complex rtc and subsequently package the encapsidated genome into viral particlesa fifth structural protein the hemagglutinin-esterase he is present in a subset of -coronaviruses the protein acts as a hemagglutinin binds sialic acids on surface glycoproteins and contains acetyl-esterase activity 25 these activities are thought to enhance s protein-mediated cell entry and virus spread through the mucosa 26 interestingly he enhances murine hepatitis virus mhv neurovirulence 27 however it is selected against in tissue culture for unknown reasons 28the initial attachment of the virion to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the s protein and its receptor the sites of receptor binding domains rbd within the s1 region of a coronavirus s protein vary depending on the virus with some having the rbd at the n-terminus of s1 mhv while others sars-cov have the rbd at the c-terminus of s1 29 30 the s-proteinreceptor interaction is the primary determinant for a coronavirus to infect a host species and also governs the tissue tropism of the virus many coronaviruses utilize peptidases as their cellular receptor it is unclear why peptidases are used as entry occurs even in the absence of the enzymatic domain of these proteins many -coronaviruses utilize aminopeptidase n apn as their receptor sars-cov and hcov-nl63 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as their receptor mhv enters through ceacam1 and the recently identified mers-cov binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 dpp4 to gain entry into human cells see table 1 for a list of known cov receptors
following receptor binding the virus must next gain access to the host cell cytosol this is generally accomplished by acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of s protein by a cathepsin tmprrs2 or another protease followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes s protein cleavage occurs at two sites within the s2 portion of the protein with the first cleavage important for separating the rbd and fusion domains of the s protein 31 and the second for exposing the fusion peptide cleavage at s2 fusion generally occurs within acidified endosomes but some coronaviruses such as mhv can fuse at the plasma membrane cleavage at s2 exposes a fusion peptide that inserts into the membrane which is followed by joining of two heptad repeats in s2 forming an antiparallel six-helix bundle 6 the formation of this bundle allows for the mixing of viral and cellular membranes resulting in fusion and ultimately release of the viral genome into the cytoplasmthe next step in the coronavirus lifecycle is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic rna the replicase gene encodes two large orfs rep1a and rep1b which express two co-terminal polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab fig 1 in order to express both polyproteins the virus utilizes a slippery sequence 5-uuuaaac-3 and an rna pseudoknot that cause ribosomal frameshifting from the rep1a reading frame into the rep1b orf in most cases the ribosome unwinds the pseudoknot structure and continues translation until it encounters the rep1a stop codon occasionally the pseudoknot blocks the ribosome from continuing elongation causing it to pause on the slippery sequence changing the reading frame by moving back one nucleotide a -1 frameshift before the ribosome is able to melt the pseudoknot structure and extend translation into rep1b resulting in the translation of pp1ab 32 33 in vitro studies predict the incidence of ribosomal frameshifting to be as high as 25  but this has not been determined in the context of virus infection it is unknown exactly why these viruses utilize frameshifting to control protein expression but it is hypothesized to either control the precise ratio of rep1b and rep1a proteins or delay the production of rep1b products until the products of rep1a have created a suitable environment for rna replication 34polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab contain the nsps 111 and 116 respectively in pp1ab nsp11 from pp1a becomes nsp12 following extension of pp1a into pp1b however -coronaviruses do not contain a comparable nsp1 these polyproteins are subsequently cleaved into the individual nsps 35 coronaviruses encode either two or three proteases that cleave the replicase polyproteins they are the papain-like proteases plpro encoded within nsp3 and a serine type protease the main protease or mpro encoded by nsp5 most coronaviruses encode two plpros within nsp3 except the -coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov which only express one plpro 36 the plpros cleave the nsp12 nsp23 and nsp34 boundaries while the mpro is responsible for the remaining 11 cleavage eventsnext many of the nsps assemble into the replicasetranscriptase complex rtc to create an environment suitable for rna synthesis and ultimately are responsible for rna replication and transcription of the sub-genomic rnas the nsps also contain other enzyme domains and functions including those important for rna replication for example nsp12 encodes the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp domain nsp13 encodes the rna helicase domain and rna 5-triphosphatase activity nsp14 encodes the exoribonuclease exon involved in replication fidelity and n7-methyltransferase activity and nsp16 encodes 2-o-methyltransferase activity in addition to the replication functions other activities such as blocking innate immune responses nsp1 nsp16-2-o-methyl transferase nsp3-deubiquitinase have been identified for some of the nsps while others have largely unknown functions nsp3-adp-ribose-1-phosphatase nsp15-endoribo-nuclease nendou for a list of non-structural proteins and their proposed functions see table 2 interestingly ribonucleases nsp15-nendou and nsp14-exon activities are unique to the nidovirales order and are considered genetic markers for these viruses 37
viral rna synthesis follows the translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes viral rna synthesis produces both genomic and sub-genomic rnas sub-genomic rnas serve as mrnas for the structural and accessory genes which reside downstream of the replicase polyproteins all positive-sense sub-genomic rnas are 3 co-terminal with the full-length viral genome and thus form a set of nested rnas a distinctive property of the order nidovirales both genomic and sub-genomic rnas are produced through negative-strand intermediates these negative-strand intermediates are only about 1  as abundant as their positive-sense counterparts and contain both poly-uridylate and anti-leader sequences 38many cis-acting sequences are important for the replication of viral rnas within the 5 utr of the genome are seven stem-loop structures that may extend into the replicase 1a gene 3942 the 3 utr contains a bulged stem-loop a pseudoknot and a hypervariable region 4346 interestingly the stem-loop and the pseudoknot at the 3 end overlap and thus cannot form simultaneously 44 47 therefore these different structures are proposed to regulate alternate stages of rna synthesis although exactly which stages are regulated and their precise mechanism of action are still unknownperhaps the most novel aspect of coronavirus replication is how the leader and body trs segments fuse during production of sub-genomic rnas this was originally thought to occur during positive-strand synthesis but now it is largely believed to occur during the discontinuous extension of negative-strand rna 48 the current model proposes that the rdrp pauses at any one of the body trs sequences trs-b following this pause the rdrp either continues elongation to the next trs or it switches to amplifying the leader sequence at the 5 end of the genome guided by complementarity of the trs-b to the leader trs trs-l many pieces of evidence currently support this model including the presence of anti-leader sequence at the 3 end of the negative-strand sub-genomic rnas 38 however many questions remain to fully define the model for instance how does the rdrp bypass all of the trs-b sequences to produce full-length negative-strand genomic rna also how are the trs-b sequences directed to the trs-l and how much complementarity is necessary 49 answers to these questions and others will be necessary to gain a full perspective of how rna replication occurs in coronavirusesfinally coronaviruses are also known for their ability to recombine using both homologous and nonhomologous recombination 50 51 the ability of these viruses to recombine is tied to the strand switching ability of the rdrp recombination likely plays a prominent role in viral evolution and is the basis for targeted rna recombination a reverse genetics tool used to engineer viral recombinants at the 3 end of the genomefollowing replication and sub-genomic rna synthesis the viral structural proteins s e and m are translated and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum er these proteins move along the secretory pathway into the endoplasmic reticulumgolgi intermediate compartment ergic 52 53 there viral genomes encapsidated by n protein bud into membranes of the ergic containing viral structural proteins forming mature virions 54the m protein directs most proteinprotein interactions required for assembly of coronaviruses however m protein is not sufficient for virion formation as virus-like particles vlps cannot be formed by m protein expression alone when m protein is expressed along with e protein vlps are formed suggesting these two proteins function together to produce coronavirus envelopes 55 n protein enhances vlp formation suggesting that fusion of encapsidated genomes into the ergic enhances viral envelopment 56 the s protein is incorporated into virions at this step but is not required for assembly the ability of the s protein to traffic to the ergic and interact with the m protein is critical for its incorporation into virionswhile the m protein is relatively abundant the e protein is only present in small quantities in the virion thus it is likely that m protein interactions provide the impetus for envelope maturation it is unknown how e protein assists m protein in assembly of the virion and several possibilities have been suggested some work has indicated a role for the e protein in inducing membrane curvature 5759 although others have suggested that e protein prevents the aggregation of m protein 60 the e protein may also have a separate role in promoting viral release by altering the host secretory pathway 61the m protein also binds to the nucleocapsid and this interaction promotes the completion of virion assembly these interactions have been mapped to the c-terminus of the endodomain of m with ctd of the n-protein 62 however it is unclear exactly how the nucleocapsid complexed with virion rna traffics to the ergic to interact with m protein and become incorporated into the viral envelope another outstanding question is how the n protein selectively packages only positive-sense full-length genomes among the many different rna species produced during infection a packaging signal for mhv has been identified in the nsp15 coding sequence but mutation of this signal does not appear to affect virus production and a mechanism for how this packaging signal works has not been determined 22 furthermore most coronaviruses do not contain similar sequences at this locus indicating that packaging may be virus specificfollowing assembly virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis it is not known if the virions use the traditional pathway for transport of large cargo from the golgi or if the virus has diverted a separate unique pathway for its own exit in several coronaviruses s protein that does not get assembled into virions transits to the cell surface where it mediates cellcell fusion between infected cells and adjacent uninfected cells this leads to the formation of giant multinucleated cells which allows the virus to spread within an infected organism without being detected or neutralized by virus-specific antibodiescoronaviruses cause a large variety of diseases in animals and their ability to cause severe disease in livestock and companion animals such as pigs cows chickens dogs and cats led to significant research on these viruses in the last half of the twentieth century for instance transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv cause severe gastroenteritis in young piglets leading to significant morbidity mortality and ultimately economic losses pedv recently emerged in north america for the first time causing significant losses of young piglets porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev mostly leads to enteric infection but has the ability to infect the nervous system causing encephalitis vomiting and wasting in pigs feline enteric coronavirus fcov causes a mild or asymptomatic infection in domestic cats but during persistent infection mutation transforms the virus into a highly virulent strain of fcov feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv that leads to development of a lethal disease called feline infectious peritonitis fip fip has wet and dry forms with similarities to the human disease sarcoidosis fipv is macrophage tropic and it is believed that it causes aberrant cytokine andor chemokine expression and lymphocyte depletion resulting in lethal disease 63 however additional research is needed to confirm this hypothesis bovine cov rat cov and infectious bronchitis virus ibv cause mild to severe respiratory tract infections in cattle rats and chickens respectively bovine cov causes significant losses in the cattle industry and also has spread to infect a variety of ruminants including elk deer and camels in addition to severe respiratory disease the virus causes diarrhea winter dysentery and shipping fever all leading to weight loss dehydration decreased milk production and depression 63 some strains of ibv a -coronavirus also affect the urogenital tract of chickens causing renal disease infection of the reproductive tract with ibv significantly diminishes egg production causing substantial losses in the egg-production industry each year 63 more recently a novel coronavirus named sw1 has been identified in a deceased beluga whale 64 large numbers of virus particles were identified in the liver of the deceased whale with respiratory disease and acute liver failure although electron microscopic images were not sufficient to identify the virus as a coronavirus sequencing of the liver tissue clearly identified the virus as a coronavirus it was subsequently determined to be a -coronavirus based on phylogenetic analysis but it has not yet been verified experimentally that this virus is actually a causative agent of disease in whales in addition there has been intense interest in identifying novel bat covs since these are the likely ancestors for sars-cov and mers-cov and hundreds of novel bat coronaviruses have been identified over the past decade 65 finally another novel family of nidoviruses mesoniviridae has been recently identified as the first nidoviruses to exclusively infect insect hosts 66 67 these viruses are highly divergent from other nidoviruses but are most closely related to the roniviruses in size they are 20 kb falling in between large and small nidoviruses interestingly these viruses do not encode for an endoribonuclease which is present in all other nidoviruses these attributes suggest these viruses are the prototype of a new nidovirus family and may be a missing link in the transition from small to large nidovirusesthe most heavily studied animal coronavirus is murine hepatitis virus mhv which causes a variety of outcomes in mice including respiratory enteric hepatic and neurologic infections these infections often serve as highly useful models of disease for instance mhv-1 causes severe respiratory disease in susceptible aj and c3hhej mice a59 and mhv-3 induce severe hepatitis while jhmv causes severe encephalitis interestingly mhv-3 induces cellular injury through the activation of the coagulation cascade 68 most notably a59 and attenuated versions of jhmv cause a chronic demyelinating disease that bears similarities to multiple sclerosis ms making mhv infection one of the best models for this debilitating human disease early studies suggested that demyelination was dependent on viral replication in oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord 69 70 however more recent reports clearly demonstrate that the disease is immune-mediated irradiated mice or immunodeficient lacking t and b cells mice do not develop demyelination but addition of virus-specific t cells restores the development of demyelination 71 72 additionally demyelination is accompanied by a large influx of macrophages and microglia that can phagocytose infected myelin 73 although it is unknown what the signals are that direct immune cells to destroy myelin finally mhv can be studied under bsl2 laboratory conditions unlike sars-cov or mers-cov which require a bsl3 laboratory and provides a large number of suitable animal models these factors make mhv an ideal model for studying the basics of viral replication in tissue culture cells as well as for studying the pathogenesis and immune response to coronavirusesprior to the sars-cov outbreak coronaviruses were only thought to cause mild self-limiting respiratory infections in humans two of these human coronaviruses are -coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 while the other two are -coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 were isolated nearly 50 years ago 7476 while hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 have only recently been identified following the sars-cov outbreak 77 78 these viruses are endemic in the human populations causing 1530  of respiratory tract infections each year they cause more severe disease in neonates the elderly and in individuals with underlying illnesses with a greater incidence of lower respiratory tract infection in these populations hcov-nl63 is also associated with acute laryngotracheitis croup 79 one interesting aspect of these viruses is their differences in tolerance to genetic variability hcov-229e isolates from around the world have only minimal sequence divergence 80 while hcov-oc43 isolates from the same location but isolated in different years show significant genetic variability 81 this likely explains the inability of hcov-229e to cross the species barrier to infect mice while hcov-oc43 and the closely related bovine coronavirus bcov are capable of infecting mice and several ruminant species based on the ability of mhv to cause demyelinating disease it has been suggested that human covs may be involved in the development of multiple sclerosis ms however no evidence to date suggests that human covs play a significant role in mssars-cov a group 2b -coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak that occurred in 20022003 in the guangdong province of china it is the most severe human disease caused by any coronavirus during the 20022003 outbreak approximately 8098 cases occurred with 774 deaths resulting in a mortality rate of 9  this rate was much higher in elderly individuals with mortality rates approaching 50  in individuals over 60 years of age furthermore the outbreak resulted in the loss of nearly 40 billion dollars in economic activity as the virus nearly shut down many activities in southeast asia and toronto canada for several months the outbreak began in a hotel in hong kong and ultimately spread to more than two dozen countries during the epidemic closely related viruses were isolated from several exotic animals including himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs 82 however it is widely accepted that sars-cov originated in bats as a large number of chinese horseshoe bats contain sequences of sars-related covs and contain serologic evidence for a prior infection with a related cov 83 84 in fact two novel bat sars-related covs have been recently identified that are more similar to sars-cov than any other virus identified to date 85 they were also found to use the same receptor as the human virus angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 providing further evidence that sars-cov originated in bats although some human individuals within wet animal markets had serologic evidence of sars-cov infection prior to the outbreak these individuals had no apparent symptoms 82 thus it is likely that a closely related virus circulated in the wet animal markets for several years before a series of factors facilitated its spread into the larger populationtransmission of sars-cov was relatively inefficient as it only spread through direct contact with infected individuals after the onset of illness thus the outbreak was largely contained within households and healthcare settings 86 except in a few cases of superspreading events where one individual was able to infect multiple contacts due to an enhanced development of high viral burdens or ability to aerosolize virus as a result of the relatively inefficient transmission of sars-cov the outbreak was controllable through the use of quarantining only a small number of sars cases occurred after the outbreak was controlled in june 2003sars-cov primarily infects epithelial cells within the lung the virus is capable of entering macrophages and dendritic cells but only leads to an abortive infection 87 88 despite this infection of these cell types may be important in inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines that may contribute to disease 89 in fact many cytokines and chemokines are produced by these cell types and are elevated in the serum of sars-cov infected patients 90 the exact mechanism of lung injury and cause of severe disease in humans remains undetermined viral titers seem to diminish when severe disease develops in both humans and in several animal models of the disease furthermore animals infected with rodent-adapted sars-cov strains show similar clinical features to the human disease including an age-dependent increase in disease severity 91 these animals also show increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and reduced t-cell responses suggesting a possible immunopathological mechanism of disease 92 93while the sars-cov epidemic was controlled in 2003 and the virus has not since returned a novel human cov emerged in the middle east in 2012 this virus named middle east respiratory syndrome-cov mers-cov was found to be the causative agent in a series of highly pathogenic respiratory tract infections in saudi arabia and other countries in the middle east 94 based on the high mortality rate of 50  in the early stages of the outbreak it was feared the virus would lead to a very serious outbreak however the outbreak did not accelerate in 2013 although sporadic cases continued throughout the rest of the year in april 2014 a spike of over 200 cases and almost 40 deaths occurred prompting fears that the virus had mutated and was more capable of human-to-human transmission more likely the increased number of cases resulted from improved detection and reporting methods combined with a seasonal increase in birthing camels as of august 27th 2014 there have been a total of 855 cases of mers-cov with 333 deaths and a case fatality rate of nearly 40  according to the european center for disease prevention and controlmers-cov is a group 2c -coronavirus highly related to two previously identified bat coronaviruses hku4 and hku5 95 it is believed that the virus originated from bats but likely had an intermediate host as humans rarely come in contact with bat secreta serological studies have identified mers-cov antibodies in dromedary camels in the middle east 96 and cell lines from camels have been found to be permissive for mers-cov replication 97 providing evidence that dromedary camels may be the natural host more convincing evidence for this comes from recent studies identifying nearly identical mers-covs in both camels and human cases in nearby proximities in saudi arabia 98 99 in one of these studies the human case had direct contact with an infected camel and the virus isolated from this patient was identical to the virus isolated from the camel 99 at the present time it remains to be determined how many mers-cov cases can be attributed to an intermediate host as opposed to human-to-human transmission it has also been postulated that human-to-camel spread contributed to the outbreakmers-cov utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 as its receptor 100 the virus is only able to use the receptor from certain species such as bats humans camels rabbits and horses to establish infection unfortunately for researchers the virus is unable to infect mouse cells due to differences in the structure of dpp4 making it difficult to evaluate potential vaccines or antivirals recently a small animal model for mers-cov has been developed using an adenoviral vector to introduce the human dpp4 gene into mouse lungs 101 this unique system makes it possible to test therapeutic interventions and novel vaccines for mers-cov in any animal sensitive to adenoviral transductionsin most cases of self-limited infection diagnosis of coronaviruses is unnecessary as the disease will naturally run its course however it may be important in certain clinical and veterinary settings or in epidemiological studies to identify an etiological agent diagnosis is also important in locations where a severe cov outbreak is occurring such as at present in the middle east where mers-cov continues to circulate the identification of cases will guide the development of public health measures to control outbreaks it is also important to diagnose cases of severe veterinary cov-induced disease such as pedv and ibv to control these pathogens and protect food supplies rt-pcr has become the method of choice for diagnosis of human cov as multiplex real-time rt-pcr assays have been developed are able to detect all four respiratory hcovs and could be further adapted to novel covs 102 103 serologic assays are important in cases where rna is difficult to isolate or is no longer present and for epidemiological studiesto date there are no antiviral therapeutics that specifically target human coronaviruses so treatments are only supportive in vitro interferons ifns are only partially effective against coronaviruses 104 ifns in combination with ribavirin may have increased activity in vitro when compared to ifns alone against some coronaviruses however the effectiveness of this combination in vivo requires further evaluation 105 the sars and mers outbreaks have stimulated research on these viruses and this research has identified a large number of suitable antiviral targets such as viral proteases polymerases and entry proteins significant work remains however to develop drugs that target these processes and are able to inhibit viral replicationonly limited options are available to prevent coronavirus infections vaccines have only been approved for ibv tgev and canine cov but these vaccines are not always used because they are either not very effective or in some cases have been reported to be involved in the selection of novel pathogenic covs via recombination of circulating strains vaccines for veterinary pathogens such as pedv may be useful in such cases where spread of the virus to a new location could lead to severe losses of veterinary animals in the case of sars-cov several potential vaccines have been developed but none are yet approved for use these vaccines include recombinant attenuated viruses live virus vectors or individual viral proteins expressed from dna plasmids therapeutic sars-cov neutralizing antibodies have been generated and could be retrieved and used again in the event of another sars-cov outbreak such antibodies would be most useful for protecting healthcare workers in general it is thought that live attenuated vaccines would be the most efficacious in targeting coronaviruses this was illustrated in the case of tgev where an attenuated variant prcv appeared in europe in the 1980s this variant only caused mild disease and completely protected swine from tgev thus this attenuated virus has naturally prevented the reoccurrence of severe tgev in europe and the us over the past 30 years 106 despite this success vaccine development for coronaviruses faces many challenges 107 first for mucosal infections natural infection does not prevent subsequent infection and so vaccines must either induce better immunity than the original virus or must at least lessen the disease incurred during a secondary infection second the propensity of the viruses to recombine may pose a problem by rendering the vaccine useless and potentially increasing the evolution and diversity of the virus in the wild 108 finally it has been shown in fipv that vaccination with s protein leads to enhanced disease 109 despite this several strategies are being developed for vaccine development to reduce the likelihood of recombination for instance by making large deletions in the nsp1 110 or e proteins 111 rearranging the 3 end of the genome 112 modifying the trs sequences 113 or using mutant viruses with abnormally high mutation rates that significantly attenuate the virus 114owing to the lack of effective therapeutics or vaccines the best measures to control human coronaviruses remain a strong public health surveillance system coupled with rapid diagnostic testing and quarantine when necessary for international outbreaks cooperation of governmental entities public health authorities and health care providers is critical during veterinary outbreaks that are readily transmitted such as pedv more drastic measures such as destruction of entire herds of pigs may be necessary to prevent transmission of these deadly virusesover the past 50 years the emergence of many different coronaviruses that cause a wide variety of human and veterinary diseases has occurred it is likely that these viruses will continue to emerge and to evolve and cause both human and veterinary outbreaks owing to their ability to recombine mutate and infect multiple species and cell typesfuture research on coronaviruses will continue to investigate many aspects of viral replication and pathogenesis first understanding the propensity of these viruses to jump between species to establish infection in a new host and to identify significant reservoirs of coronaviruses will dramatically aid in our ability to predict when and where potential epidemics may occur as bats seem to be a significant reservoir for these viruses it will be interesting to determine how they seem to avoid clinically evident disease and become persistently infected second many of the non-structural and accessory proteins encoded by these viruses remain uncharacterized with no known function and it will be important to identify mechanisms of action for these proteins as well as defining their role in viral replication and pathogenesis these studies should lead to a large increase in the number of suitable therapeutic targets to combat infections furthermore many of the unique enzymes encoded by coronaviruses such as adp-ribose-1-phosphatase are also present in higher eukaryotes making their study relevant to understanding general aspects of molecular biology and biochemistry third gaining a complete picture of the intricacies of the rtc will provide a framework for understanding the unique rna replication process used by these viruses finally defining the mechanism of how coronaviruses cause disease and understanding the host immunopathological response will significantly improve our ability to design vaccines and reduce disease burdenthe emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in guangdong province china in 2002 and its subsequent spread in asia and canada clearly exemplified the vulnerability of societies and economies to a novel highly pathogenic respiratory agent stadler et al 2003 peiris et al 2003b the outbreak which was halted solely by the quarantine of exposed individuals and the use of conventional prevention measures such as surgical masks was paralleled by an international collaborative scientific effort to develop means for therapeutic and preventive intervention peiris et al 2004 stadler and rappuoli 2005 the basis for the development of successful antiviral strategies is a thorough understanding of the molecular biology underlying viral amplification and pathogenesis and many significant discoveries have been made in the sars field since the identification of the virus early in 2003 drosten et al 2003 ksiazek et al 2003 peiris et al 2003a several of these findings provided important insights into the structure and function of the viral spike s protein which is used by the virus as the key to bind and enter host cells hofmann and phlmann 2004 the most well-known examples are the identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as the host factor which is engaged by the viral s protein for infectious entry into cells and the elucidation of the structure of the s protein receptor binding domain rbd in complex with ace2 li et al 2003 2005a these findings have major implications not only for vaccine and inhibitor development but also for our understanding of the sars zoonosis since adaptation of sars-s to robust usage of human ace2 was probably of key importance for efficient sars-cov spread in humans li et al 2005a 2005c in this chapter we will discuss how sars-cov gains access to target cells and how this process can be inhibited in addition we will review how the molecular interactions underlying sars-cov entry impact viral pathogenesis and interspecies transmissionthe sars-sprotein is a type i transmembrane protein which comprises 1255 amino acids and contains 23 consensus signals for n-linked glycosylation hofmann and phlmann 2004 s protein is synthesized in the secretory pathway of infected cells it contains an n-terminal signal sequence which mediates import of the nascent protein into the endoplasmatic reticulum where the protein is folded and modified with mannose-rich carbohydrates upon transport of the protein into the golgi apparatus most if not all of the high-mannose carbohydrates are processed into complex glycans nal et al 2005 evidence of o-glycosylation of sars-s has not been reported a novel dibasic er retrieval motif in the cytoplasmic tail of sars-s promotes accumulation of the s protein at the ergolgi intermediate compartment and the golgi region mcbride et al 2007 the sites where progeny particles are assembled stertz et al 2007 siu et al 2008 formation and budding of new particles are driven by the membrane protein m the envelope protein e and the nucleocapsid protein n huang et al 2004 hsieh et al 2005 siu et al 2008 interactions with the m protein might facilitate s protein incorporation into particles trimers of the s protein protrude from the viral envelope and provide virions with a crown lat corona -like appearance from which the name coronaviruses is derivedthe domain organization of sars-s resembles that of several well-characterized viral membrane proteins such as influenza virus hemagglutinin ha and human immunodeficiency virus hiv envelope protein env hofmann and phlmann 2004 these proteins employ comparable strategies to facilitate fusion of viral and host cell membranes and are termed class i fusion proteins kielian and rey 2006 they are distinguished from class ii fusion proteins kielian 2006 found for example on flavi- and alphaviruses by their distinct spatial organization and the particular configuration of the functional elements required for fusion with target cells class i fusion proteins are inserted perpendicular to the viral membrane and contain an n-terminal surface unit su and a c-terminal transmembrane unit tm the globular su interacts with cellular receptors while the tm promotes fusion of the viral and host cell membrane kielian and rey 2006 the latter process depends on the presence of a fusion peptide and two helical regions hr conserved elements which are intimately involved in the membrane fusion process fig 11 as discussed below the s protein and the aforementioned fusion proteins are adapted to usage by different cellular receptors therefore the su termed s1 of sars-s does not exhibit appreciable sequence homology to the respective sequences of other class i fusion proteins in contrast the functional elements in tm particularly the hrs are conserved between different class i fusion proteins consequently the tm termed s2 of sars-s shares homology with the corresponding sequences of other viral fusion proteins hofmann and phlmann 2004 which has important implications for development of antiviral strategies as discussed below
the interaction of sars-s with ace2 is the first indispensable step in the entry cascade as discussed below it needs to be noted however that sars-s also binds to other cell surface factors and these interactions although being ultimately dispensable for infectious entry might profoundly alter infection efficiency thus it is well established that the calcium-dependent c-type lectin dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin dc-sign cd209 geijtenbeek et al 2000 and the related protein dc-signr l-sign cd209l phlmann et al 2001 bashirova et al 2001 bind to sars-s marzi et al 2004 yang et al 2004 jeffers et al 2004 khoo et al 2008 in a glycan-dependent fashion shih et al 2006 han et al 2007 dc-signr was detected in the lung on ace2-positive sars-cov-infected cells and on uninfected bystander cells chan et al 2006 while dc-sign expression was found to be induced upon sars-cov infection yen et al 2006 suggesting that these lectins might have ample opportunity to capture sars-cov in infected individualsdespite the potentially important role of dc-signr in sars-cov infection the consequences of dc-signdc-signr collectively referred to as dc-signr engagement by sars-s for viral infectivity are largely unclear one group suggested that dc-signr function as bona fide receptors which facilitate viral entry into otherwise nonpermissive hela cells han et al 2007 dc-signr was also identified in a functional screen for receptors used by sars-cov for cellular entry jeffers et al 2004 further suggesting that dc-signr might support viral entry at least under certain conditions and probably with low efficiency in contrast three other studies failed to detect an appreciable receptor function for dc-signr but suggested that these proteins might enhance infectious entry into ace2-expressing cell lines marzi et al 2004 yang et al 2004 shih et al 2006 finally and in contrast to all aforementioned studies chan and co-workers provided evidence that dc-signr plays a protective role in sars-cov infection chan et al 2006 thus it was demonstrated that dc-signr-dependent uptake of sars-cov into cell lines might lead to viral degradation and might thus reduce viral infectivity for target cells chan et al 2006 in agreement with this finding evidence was obtained that the combination of certain dc-signr allelic variants which resulted in reduced sars-cov uptake in cell culture was associated with increased risk of sars-cov infection in humans chan et al 2006 albeit these findings are not undisputed tang et al 2007 zhi et al 2007 in any case most functional studies described above have in common that they were carried out with cell lines which do not adequately model type ii pneumocytes the major targets of sars-cov infection hamming et al 2004 ding et al 2004 to and lo 2004 mossel et al 2008 and further work with primary lung epithelium is required to help to elucidate the role of dc-signr in sars-cov infection notably a single study examined the impact of dc-signr-specific antibodies on viral spread in primary human airway epithelium cultured at the airliquid interface and observed no inhibition sims et al 2008 although it was not investigated if these lectins were indeed expressed by the cells examined finally it is worth mentioning that sars-s binds to lectins other than dc-signr such as the c-type lectin lsectin gramberg et al 2005 which is largely co-expressed with dc-signr and the consequences of these interactions for viral amplification have not been determined collectively it is clear that binding to dc-signr and related lectins has the potential to modulate viral spread in vivo it remains to be determined however if lectin binding augments or suppresses viral replication recently described knock-in mice for human dc-sign schaefer et al 2008 or signr1 a murine homologue of human dc-sign knock-out mice lanoue et al 2004 might be useful to clarify these questionsa thorough understanding of the interface between sars-s and ace2 is key to the development of antiviral strategies targeting viral entry the domains and amino acid residues in sars-s and ace2 which contribute to the efficient interaction of these proteins were initially mapped by mutagenic analyses these studies identified amino acids 318510 in sars-s as an independently folded rbd which binds to ace2 with higher affinity than the full length s protein xiao et al 2003 wong et al 2004 babcock et al 2004 the rbd was also shown to be the major target of neutralizing antibodies he et al 2004a 2004b 2005 and several residues within amino acids 450490 were suggested to be critical for optimal ace2 engagement wong et al 2004 li et al 2005c in addition exploitation of species-specific differences in murine rat and human ace2 allowed the mapping of certain amino acid residues particularly l353 as important for receptor function li et al 2004 2005c these results were supported and extended by the subsequent solution of the structure of the rbd in complex with ace2 li et al 2005a the rbd consists of a core a five-stranded antiparallel -sheet and an extended loop which contains all amino acids making contacts with ace2 the extended loop also termed receptor-binding motif rbm comprises amino acids 424494 li et al 2005a and thus includes the residues defined by mutagenic analysis to be important for sars-s interactions with ace2 wong et al 2004 li et al 2005c the rbm contacts the n-terminal helix of ace2 and the loop between helices 2 and 3 moreover a portion of the rbm inserts between a short helix in ace2 amino acids 329333 and a -hairpin at ace2 residue l353 supporting the previously postulated contribution of l353 to appropriate spikereceptor interactions li et al 2005c conformational changes inherent to the peptidase activity of ace2 do not impact the availability of the s protein binding site li et al 2005a in agreement with the observation that an ace2 inhibitor which blocks peptidase activity and arrests ace2 in a closed conformation does not inhibit sars-s-dependent entry towler et al 2004 li et al 2005c collectively the functional and structural studies defined amino acids in sars-s and ace2 which facilitate the tight association of these proteins in addition the results highlighted that natural variation of these sequences might have important implications for sars-cov transmission and pathogenicity as discussed belowhorseshoe bats harbor sars-cov-related viruses and might constitute the natural reservoir of sars-cov lau et al 2005 li et al 2005b however the sequence homology between bat and human viruses is limited lau et al 2005 li et al 2005b thus the s protein of animal viruses does not contain an rbm-like sequence and does not use ace2 for cellular entry ren et al 2008 it is therefore probable that sars-cov was introduced into the human population via an intermediate host and palm civets which harbor viruses with high sequence homology to human sars-cov are possible candidates guan et al 2003 song et al 2005 notably the s proteins of human viruses from the 20022003 epidemic bind human ace2 with much higher efficiency than their palm civet counterparts li et al 2005c indicating that efficient spread in humans required adaptation of the sars-s sequence indeed sequence comparison revealed that the civet rbd contains four amino acid changes relative to the human sequence two of these changes are located outside the rbm and do not impact receptor interactions li et al 2005c in contrast the remaining two changes n human to k palm civet at position 479 and t human to s palm civet at position 487 afflicted residues making direct contact with ace2 and significantly decreased binding to human ace2 li et al 2005a 2005c thus n479 and t487 might be required for efficient spread in and between humans li et al 2005a 2005c li 2008 interestingly viruses isolated from sporadic sars cases in the winter of 20032004 which were not associated with severe disease or human-to-human transmission contained a serine at position 487 li et al 2005a further indicating that this amino acid might play a key role in human-to-human transmission and viral pathogenicitythe potential for zoonotic transmission of sars-cov might also be determined by species-specific variations in the ace2 sequence thus murine and rat ace2 which do not rat or only inefficiently murine support sars-s-driven entry li et al 2004 2005c contain a leucine human to histidine mouse rat exchange at position 353 this exchange impedes formation of robust contacts with t487 in sars-s and thereby prevents murine and rat ace2 from efficiently supporting sars-s-driven cellular entry li et al 2005a in addition the rat but not the murine receptor contains a m82n exchange which introduces a glycosylation signal the glycan added to n82 blocks the interaction with l472 in sars-s and further decreases receptor function explaining why rat ace2 is less capable of supporting sars-s-driven entry than murine ace2 li et al 2005a these results in conjunction with the aforementioned variations in the rbd sequence highlight that the efficiency of the sars-s interaction with ace2 might be a critical determinant of interspecies transmission of sars-cova novel human coronavirus nl63 was discovered by two dutch groups in the aftermath of the sars-cov outbreak van der hoek et al 2004 fouchier et al 2004 nl63 is a group i cov and shows high sequence similarity to the long-known human cov 229e the 229e virus like all other group i viruses described at the time of the nl63 discovery uses cd13 aminopeptidase n as a receptor for cellular entry hofmann and phlmann 2004 considering the specificity of group i viruses for cd13 and taking into account that the spike proteins of 229e and nl63 share 56 sequence identity van der hoek et al 2004 pyrc et al 2004 it was surprising that nl63 was shown to use ace2 and not cd13 for cellular entry hofmann et al 2005 this finding raised the question of whether both viruses use similar strategies to engage ace2 mapping studies revealed that an n-terminal unique region in nl63-s which was suspected to function as rbd is in fact dispensable for receptor engagement hofmann et al 2006 in contrast several motifs within amino acids 232 and 684 were found to be required for ace2 binding within an initial study and it was suggested that nl63-s might not harbor a single continuous rbd hofmann et al 2006 however subsequent analyses narrowed the region responsible for ace2 binding to amino acids 301643 and 476616 respectively and a sars-s rbm-like motif was identified in nl63-s li et al 2007 lin et al 2008 several amino acid substitutions in ace2 were found to alter ace2 usage by sars-s but not by nl63-s hofmann et al 2006 indicating that both s proteins might interact with different ace2 surfaces this interpretation is not undisputed li et al 2007 and solution of the structure of nl63-s in complex with ace2 might be required to clarify whether sars-s and nl63-s recognize ace2 differentially in any case it is clear that both viruses employ different mechanisms to activate membrane fusion once the s proteins have bound to ace2 thus it is believed that upon ace2 engagement sars-cov is internalized into endosomal vesicles where the ph-dependent cellular protease cathepsin l activates sars-s by cleavage simmons et al 2005 in contrast low ph and cathepsin activity seem to be largely dispensable for nl63-s-driven entry and it is at present unclear how nl63-s-driven membrane fusion is triggered huang et al 2006 hofmann et al 2006nl63 is a globally distributed pathogen which is acquired early in childhood and does not usually cause severe disease pyrc et al 2007 this observation contrasts with the high pathogenicity of sars-cov and raises the question of which viral factors determine disease severity again s protein interactions with ace2 might play a central role thus a milestone discovery by imai and colleagues indicated that ace2 expression protects against development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards imai et al 2005 ace2 is an integral component of the reninangiotensin system ras a key regulator of blood pressure and as demonstrated by imai and colleagues imai et al 2005 lung function imai et al 2008 penninger et al 2008 knock-down of ace2 in a mouse model caused accumulation of angiotensin ii which promoted development of ards by signaling via the at1r receptor imai et al 2005 2008 penninger et al 2008 conversely inhibition of at1r and application of soluble ace2 protected against ards imai et al 2005 interestingly a soluble form of the s1 subunit of sars-s was shown to downregulate ace2 expression in vitro and in vivo kuba et al 2005 indicating that sars-s engagement of ace2 might promote sars development even in the absence of productive infection the s protein of nl63 exhibits a markedly reduced affinity for ace2 compared to sars-s mathewson et al 2008 and seems to engage the receptor in a different fashion hofmann et al 2006 suggesting that differential ace2 downregulation by sars-cov and nl63 could contribute to the differential pathogenicity of these viruses however it is largely unclear how sars-cov decreases ace2 expression and the effect of nl63 on ace2 levels has not been systematically investigated notably a recent study indicates that sars-s might promote shedding of the ace2 ectodomain by inducing ace2 cleavage by taceadam17 fig 12 a process that seems to be essential for infectious entry haga et al 2008 in contrast nl63-s did not induce appreciable ace2 shedding haga et al 2008 thus the previously observed ace2 downregulation by sars-s might have been due to proteolytic cleavage and dissociation of the ectodomain rather than ace2 internalization and degradation however it is unclear if shedding of the ace2 ectodomain actually exacerbates sars development considering that soluble ace2 protects against ards in a mouse model imai et al 2005
class i fusion proteins usually require proteolytic cleavage to transit into an activated state hofmann and phlmann 2004 kielian and rey 2006 however the strategies to accomplish proteolytic activation can vary many fusion proteins are cleaved by subtilisin-like proteases in the secretory pathway of infected cells and proteolytically processed proteins are incorporated into virions this applies to the s proteins of most strains of murine hepatitis virus mhv a group ii coronavirus the membrane fusion reaction is subsequently triggered by binding of the cleaved s proteins to their cellular receptor ceacam-1 williams et al 1991 nash and buchmeier 1997 de haan et al 2004 qiu et al 2006 consequently entry is ph-independent and encompasses fusion of the viral membrane with the plasma membrane of target cells nash and buchmeier 1997 de haan et al 2004 qiu et al 2006 the influenza virus ha is either cleaved by subtilisin proteases in the secretory pathway or by secreted proteases present in the lung lumen however subsequent binding to the receptor determinant sialic acid does not trigger membrane fusion but internalization into endosomal vesicles where fusion is triggered by low ph eckert and kim 2001 thus infectious entry of influenza viruses is ph-dependent and is facilitated by fusion of the viral membrane with endosomal membranes eckert and kim 2001the sars-s protein employs a mixture of the entry strategies described above at present there is no evidence for appreciable cleavage of sars-s produced in infected cells xiao et al 2003 yang et al 2004 simmons et al 2004 yao et al 2004 hofmann et al 2004b with the exception of a single report wu et al 2004 it has been documented that the presence of furin can augment sars-s activity and that a furin inhibitor blocks sars-cov infection bergeron et al 2005 follis et al 2006 however cleavage of sars-s has not been detected under these conditions bergeron et al 2005 follis et al 2006 instead a seminal study by simmons and colleagues showed that sars-s is activated by the endosomal ph-dependent protease cathepsin l upon uptake into target cells and that cathepsin l activity is essential for infectious entry simmons et al 2005 cathepsin b can also contribute to sars-s activation but seems to be of minor importance compared to cathepsin l simmons et al 2005 importantly appropriate sars-s cleavage by cathepsin l seems to require a modest conformational rearrangement of sars-s simmons et al 2005 which is induced upon binding to ace2 beniac et al 2007 thus sars-s-driven entry is ph-dependent and relies on fusion of viral and endosomal membranes yang et al 2004 simmons et al 2004 2005 hofmann et al 2004b however acidic conditions are required for cathepsin activity and have no triggering effect on sars-s simmons et al 2005the cathepsin l cleavage site in sars-s was mapped to t678 when recombinant proteins were employed bosch et al 2008 but evidence that t678 is important for sars-cov entry is lacking and cathepsin l-mediated cleavage of virion-associated sars-s in target cells remains to be demonstrated it is also unclear if cellular proteases other than cathepsin b and l can allow sars-s-driven entry into certain target cells an activating function of factor xa has recently been suggested du et al 2007 but the results await confirmation finally it is noteworthy that engineered cleavage of sars-s in virus-producing cells can ablate the need for cathepsin activity in target cells watanabe et al 2008 this finding highlights the need to analyze if sars-s is cleaved in primary lung cells and to determine if cathepsin activity is indeed required for viral spread in vivo  information pivotal to efforts aiming at the development of cathepsin inhibitors for antiviral therapythe functional organization of sars-s2 resembles that of the tms of other class i fusion proteins and sars-s-driven membrane fusion reaction follows the principles previously established for other class i fusion proteins hofmann and phlmann 2004 membrane fusion commences by insertion of the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane fig 13 in this context it is worth noting that sars-s in contrast to for example hiv env and influenza ha contains an internal fusion peptide which does not constitute the n terminus of s2 but may comprise amino acids 770788 sainz et al 2005 upon fusion peptide insertion the s2 subunit is connected with the viral and the target cell membrane subsequently the c-terminal hr termed hr2 folds back onto the n-terminal hr termed hr1 forming an energetically stable six-helix bundle structure in which hr1 and hr2 are oriented in an antiparallel fashion bosch et al 2003 tripet et al 2004 liu et al 2004 supekar et al 2004 ingallinella et al 2004 xu et al 2004 hsu et al 2004 thereby viral and target cell membranes are pulled into close proximity allowing the membranes to merge fig 13 peptides derived from hr2 which bind to hr1 and block the formation of the six-helix bundle are used for therapy of hiv infection este and telenti 2007 a similar approach was successful for blockade of sars-cov spread in cell culture bosch et al 2003 liu et al 2004 zhu et al 2004 yuan et al 2004 ni et al 2005 but the inhibitors developed were not as potent as those used to treat hiv infection one reason for the decreased potency might be inherent to the cellular location of the membrane fusion reaction the hiv env protein drives fusion with the plasma cell membrane and the target of the inhibitory peptides is readily accessible in contrast sars-cov fuses with endosomal membranes and inhibitors must be taken up into endosomes to efficiently block the fusion reaction potentially this could present a significant hurdle to the development of fusion inhibitors for therapy of sars-cov infection watanabe et al 2008
the cellular entry of sars-cov is a multistep process which involves the formation of several transient intermediates all structures participating in the entry cascade are potential targets for inhibitors and the feasibility of several approaches to prevent entry has already been demonstrated the first step sars-s engagement of ace2 is an attractive target for both preventive and therapeutic approaches thus the immunization with the rbd has been shown to elicit neutralizing antibodies he et al 2004a 2005 and monoclonal rbd-specific antibodies which exhibit potent antiviral effects in animal models have been identified sui et al 2004 2005 rockx et al 2007 zhu et al 2007 in addition sars-s binding to ace2 can be inhibited by nonpeptidic molecules targeting the receptor huentelman et al 2004 and soluble ace2 was shown to block sars-cov infection hofmann et al 2004a and to protect against ards kuba et al 2005 making this approach particularly promising the s protein can also be targeted by lectins which bind glycans on the s protein and thereby block viral entry van der meer et al 2007 keyaerts et al 2007 albeit issues concerning potential toxicity and antigenicity remain to be addressed after binding to ace2 and uptake into target cells the s protein must be activated by cathepsin l and potent cathepsin l inhibitors are available simmons et al 2005 however the role of cathepsin l in viral spread in vivo remains to be assessed and knock-out mice reinheckel et al 2001 might be suitable tools for these endeavours finally inhibitors of the fusion reaction have been described bosch et al 2003 liu et al 2004 zhu et al 2004 yuan et al 2004 ni et al 2005 but optimization of available compounds and generation of nonpeptidic compounds is desirable in summary the approaches described above particularly combinations thereof should allow development of compounds suitable for effectively preventing or combating future outbreaks of sars-covthe recent identification of a novel human coronavirus emc hcov-emc as the causative agent for severe human respiratory disease raised fears that a version of the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic would recur this fear prompted intense research efforts that resulted in publications describing the clinical characteristics of the human infection and complete sequence and genomic characterization of the virus 1 additional analyses showed that that the virus was related to two previously identified bat coronaviruses preliminary sequence analysis of virus isolated from a pipistrellus pipistrellus bat in the netherlands suggested an even closer relationship with 88 nucleotide identity to a fragment of the rna-dependent rna polymerase in a recent article in mbio mller et al provided important information about the host cell receptor used by the virus to infect cells 2 first the receptor is not human ace2 hace2 which is used by the sars coronavirus to infect humans second the virus is able to infect human bat and porcine cells the latter result is remarkable because coronaviruses in general show fairly strict host specificity in early studies of another betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus serial passage was required for adaptation to human cells 3we know now that hace2 is not the hcov-emc receptor but clearly identification of the host cell receptor used by hcov-emc is a high priority the limited information that is available suggests several possibilities about the identity of the receptor first human transmission may occur but is not common this disparity between severe infection and poor transmissibility also occurs in patients infected with the influenza a virus h5n1 strain iav-h5n1 iav-h5n1 enters cells via glycans that contain a terminal 23-linked sialic acid unlike human strains of the virus which bind to terminal 26-linked sialic acid moieties terminal 23-linked sialic acid proteins are not common in the human airway and are largely restricted to the lower airway explaining the poor transmissibility exhibited by the virus use of a glycan for cell entry either as a primary or binding ligand might allow hcov-emc to infect cells from a variety of species and depending on the location in the lung of the specific glycan in question may explain the lack of transmissibility between humans there is precedent for sialic acid usage by coronaviruses both bovine coronavirus and hcov-oc43 enter cells via binding sialic acid consequently these viruses are able to infect most tissue culture cells and also to spread to infect a large variety of ruminants 4second uncommon human transmissibility may also reflect usage of a protein that is present predominantly in the lower respiratory tracts of humans even though sars-cov caused a respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality it was not easily transmissible between humans in part because its receptor hace2 is most abundant in the lungs and less so in the upper airway 5 consequently most sars-cov-infected patients were not contagious until after they developed pneumonia with spread occurring via large droplets this resulted in a high proportion of secondary cases being close contacts either family members or health care workers and also enabled the effectiveness of quarantining in controlling the infection parenthetically a few individuals were able to spread sars-cov very efficiently superspreading events 6 and these events had a disproportionate effect on the widespread nature of the infection virus burdens were presumed to be higher in patients associated with superspreading events with enhanced spread via fine droplets whether these events reflected differences in localization of hace2 throughout the airway in innate cell t cell or antibody responses or in expression of another factor was not determined before the epidemic was controlledif the receptor for hcov-emc is a protein it is predicted to have a distribution similar to that of ace2 or an even more pronounced localization to the lower respiratory tract given its apparent lack of human-to-human spread it will also be interesting to determine whether the receptor is an ectopeptidase several alphacoronaviruses including hcov-229e and transmissible gastroenteritis virus a pathogenic porcine coronavirus use aminopeptidase n apn both apn and hace2 are ectopeptidases and cleave n-terminal amino acids from small peptides however in neither instance is the enzymatic activity of the protein required for receptor function suggesting that the structure of the ectodomain of each molecule is especially amenable to coronavirus binding in addition to serving as the receptor for sars-cov ace2 has lung-protective properties downregulation of ace2 as occurs during sars-cov infection is believed to contribute to pathological changes in the lung 7 it will be of interest to determine if the receptor for hcov-emc has similar propertiesidentification of the receptor may also shed light on a potentially novel aspect of hcov-emc pathogenesis initial reports suggest that renal failure is part of the disease process 8 although at this point it is impossible to know whether this is a specific effect or a consequence of the multiorgan failure that often occurs in severely ill patients if kidney involvement is documented in most patients identification of the hcov-emc receptor may provide a basis for understanding why renal disease is common the sars-cov receptor ace2 is present at high levels in the human kidney and sars-cov was detected in the kidneys of some patients during the 2002-2003 epidemic but renal disease did not occur commonly during the infection 5 understanding the differential abilities of hcov-emc and sars-cov to cause renal disease will provide insight into a unique aspect of the hcov-emc infection of note coronavirus infection of the respiratory tract and renal system has been described in chickens infected with another coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv 9 ibv is best known as an important causative agent for upper respiratory tract disease in young chickens but strains that also infect the kidney have been identified the cellular receptor for ibv has not been identified so the relationship between receptor expression and disease for different ibv strains remains an area of active investigationfinally mller et al demonstrated infection of bat-derived cultured cells raising the possibility that hcov-emc jumped species directly from bats to humans this also suggests that the host cell receptor if a protein is sufficiently similar between humans and bats to facilitate direct transmission bats are recognized as key reservoirs for viruses including several coronaviruses and henipaviruses such as nipah virus and hendra virus 5 in all cases bats do not appear to develop clinical disease but disease is severe when viruses cross over to infect human populations this is analogous to the situation in humans and sooty mangabeys infected with human immunodeficiency virus hiv and the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus siv respectively sooty mangabeys infected with siv do not develop significant disease whereas hiv is fatal in humans 10 a critical question is why bats are tolerant of infections such as hcov-emc or sars-cov how do they clear the virus without developing immunopathological disease if coronavirus-infected bats are similar to siv-infected sooty mangabeys infection may not activate the host immune response to the same extent as it does in humans understanding how bats respond to the infection may provide insight into how specific aspects of the human immune response result in clinical disease this in turn may result in novel therapeutic interventions to diminish immunopathological diseasewhile identification of the receptor will be an important advance the overarching question at present is whether hcov-emc is or will become an important human pathogen at this point fewer than 10 cases have been identified and the mortality rate has been greater than 50 with so few cases infection and analysis of laboratory animals will be required to fulfill kochs postulates and prove a causative role for hcov-emc in respiratory disease if hcov-emc is associated with respiratory disease in animals as seems likely epidemiological studies to provide a denominator for the total number of cases will be essential is hcov-emc a common infection in the middle east with most patients remaining asymptomatic or developing mild disease or is the infection rare but when infection occurs disease is severe development of tools to detect past and present infections is critical and will be facilitated by recent publications of the virus sequence and genomic analysis equally important will be the collection and analysis of samples from representative populations in the middle east most patients infected with sars-cov developed clinical disease with only a few infections remaining asymptomatic if hcov-emc is a new pathogen will it further adapt to human populations as the sars-cov did during the 2002-2003 epidemic 4 6 if virus is detected only rarely in human populations and never spreads significantly from human to human it may not be a major health issue but the interesting question of how these unlucky individuals were infected remains to be addressedin the aftermath of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak the who fundamentally revised the international health regulations ihr which entered into force in 2007 the 196 states parties to the ihr recognised that certain public health events pose a significant risk to the global community and should be designated as a public health emergency of international concern pheic under article i of the ihr a pheic is defined by three criteria an extraordinary event which constitutes a public health risk to other states through international spread of disease andpotentially requires a coordinated international response the ihr annex 2 provides a decision instrument that guides states parties as to which health events have the potential to become pheics thus requiring reporting to who annex 2 of the ihr provides a decision instrument for states parties to assess which events detected by national surveillance systems would require notification to the who this includes a single case of smallpox poliomyelitis due to wild-type poliovirus human influenza caused by a new subtype and sars other health events that have the potential to cause international public health concerns or serious impact trigger an algorithm to determine if notification to who is required criteria for this algorithm include determining if the event is serious unusual or unexpected has a significant risk of international spread or poses a significant risk of international travel or trade restrictions if two of the criteria are true then notification to who is required under the ihr the ihr also empowers the who director-general dg to convene an emergency committee ec which consists of international experts brought together on an ad-hoc basis the ec provides their advice on whether the current situation should be considered a pheic and what temporary recommendations should be given to member states to bolster the response and control the outbreak ultimately however the who dg has sole authority to declare a pheic and make temporary recommendations for member states to follow1the whos decision-making under the ihr has come under intense scrutiny especially its decision whether to declare a pheic global commissions for example strongly criticised the organisation for waiting 4 months after international spread of ebola virus disease evd in west africa 20142016 before declaring an emergency2 during the ongoing evd outbreak in the democratic republic of congo drc the ec met a total of six times but did not declare a pheic until the fourth convocation more than 11 months after the outbreak began3 4 most recently the whos judgement in response to coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 has been questioned the who dg first convened the ec on january 22 but announced it had insufficient data from china to arrive at a decision the following day the ec was almost equally divided but ultimately said it was too early to declare a pheic seven days later on 30 january 2020 during the second ec meeting the dg declared a pheic the who dg openly stated that the ihr should be reformed to allow intermediate levels for declaring an emergency suggesting that an all or nothing standard hindered ec decision-making3 5experts have urged who to clarify how decisions should be reached68 as well as proposing greater transparency in the ec decision-making process to better understand why the committee recommended or did not recommend a pheic declaration9 overall the ihr ec decision-making process is open to considerable interpretation10 in addition the who dg has raised concerns about the negative impacts that pheic declarations may trigger especially travel and trade restrictions3 5to date there has yet to be a comprehensive analysis of ec recommendations and who dg decision-making regarding pheic declarations to describe how the ec and the who dg relied on and interpreted these criteria in previous decisions to declare or not to declare pheics we examined the ecs decision-making in all instances where it has met from when the revised ihr entered into force in 2007 we summarised and categorised the justifications offered by the ec identified the criteria used in each situation and compared these to criteria for pheics outlined by the ihr based on this analysis we offer important recommendations for increasing transparency and consistency in ec recommendations and pheic decision-making adoption of these regulations would strengthen ihr decision-making and who legitimacy in responding to major outbreakspatients and the public were not involved in this studyapproximately 1 month after initial cases were detected the first ec was convened and a pheic declared the ec indicated that all three conditions for a pheic had been met the event was considered extraordinary there was a public health risk to other states via international spread and an international response was required to control the outbreak the ec met a total of nine times throughout the pandemic but did not recommend the pheic be declared over until 10 august 2010 as it no longer represented an extraordinary event the world was no longer experiencing an influenza pandemic and the response did not require immediate emergency actions on an international scale3while regular notifications of mers-cov cases were reported to who for 20122013 approximately 10 months following the initial notification on 22 september 2012 the who dg convened the ec to independently offer an expert review of the situation regarding this novel virus at the first meeting on 9 july 2013 the ec determined that more information was needed and further time was warranted for deliberation therefore it was agreed that the committee would meet in 8 days to provide a decision the ec met a total of 10 times between 9 july 2013 and 2 september 2015 and a pheic was not declared at any point3 numerous countries reported mers-cov cases thus indicating there was a public health risk to other countries through international spread11 12 in 2015 south korea reported 186 laboratory-confirmed cases and 38 deaths the largest outbreak outside of the middle east13 that same year on 2 september 2015 the ec noted that progress is not yet sufficient to control this threat and until this is achieved individual countries and the global community will remain at significant risk for further outbreaks despite being a novel virus the ec did not consider the mers-cov outbreaks to be an extraordinary event while the ec did not explicitly state that a coordinated international response was required in their final meeting they noted that sectors must collaborate among themselves and internationally implying a coordinated international response was necessary3the first ec meeting on 2829 april 2014 was convened to discuss the international spread of wild poliovirus in 2014 and its threat to the global polio eradication initiative the difference between the low transmission rates for poliovirus in 2012 and early 2013 compared to a rapid increase in transmission rates in late 2013 and into 2014 brought concern that eradication efforts were at risk the committee reported all conditions for a pheic were met since 28 april 2014 the ec convened an additional 21 times and deemed the pheic declaration should continue as the risk of international spread and need for a coordinated international response remained the committee also argued that the extraordinary context of being close to polio eradication and the concern of complacency threatening the eradication efforts support the argument to continue the pheic declaration3the who published the official notification of the outbreak on 23 march 201414 the first ec was convened over 4 months later on 67 august 2014 after cases had been reported from guinea liberia nigeria and sierra leone the committee determined the outbreak constituted an extraordinary event posed a public health risk to other states through international spread and required a coordinated international response to control the virus therefore concluding the conditions for a pheic have been met3two months after the pan american health organization and who published an epidemiological alert regarding an increase in neurological disorders in areas where zika was reported15 on 1 february 2016 the ec was convened to deliberate on whether a pheic was constituted3 while 25 countries in the americas had reported cases of zika16 17 there was no mention of the public health risk to other states through international spread in the initial meeting where a pheic was declared the committee also did not note whether a coordinated international response was required there was no mention in this meeting that the event was considered extraordinary however language from a later ec meeting on 18 november 2016 indicated that the unknown apparent association between zika and neurological disorders was considered an extraordinary event the ec did not determine that zika itself was a pheic but rather the report of zika cases with the additional concern of neurological disorders constituted a pheic the ec met a total of five times from february 2016 to 18 november 2016 and noted the gaps in knowledge of the virus and its consequences3four months after notification of yellow fever cases in angola18 the who dg convened an ec on 19 may 2016 there was international spread of yellow fever to drc china and kenya and the committee noted the international risk posed by the outbreak it also called for international support for the response yet the ec determined the event did not constitute a pheic the committee met a second time on 31 august 2016 and reported similar findings during both meetings the committee made no note on whether the outbreak was considered an extraordinary event3the ninth evd outbreak of drc was declared by its ministry of health on 8 may 2018 in the equateur province19 and 10 days later the who dg convened the ec the committee reported that the conditions for a pheic had not been met while the committee noted that the public health risk of international spread was high they considered that the robust coordinated response by the drc government who and partners and the interventions underway provided strong reason to believe that the outbreak can be brought under control the committee also noted that there was no actual international spread which appeared to impact their decision not to declare a pheic as they noted if the outbreak expands significantly or if there is international spread the emergency committee will be reconvened the committee made no mention on whether the event was considered extraordinary due to the brevity of the outbreak only one ec meeting was convened3on 17 october 2018 the who dg convened the first ec for drcs 10th evd outbreak centred in the north kivu and ituri provinces a pheic was not declared until the fourth ec meeting on 17 july 2019 the committee expressed in multiple meetings that a pheic declaration may be detrimental to the ongoing response for example in the second ec meeting the committee noted there is no added benefit to declaring a pheic at this stage and in the third ec meeting the committee extensively debated the impact of a pheic declaration on the response possible unintended consequences and how these might be managed during the first two meetings while the ec reported that while there was a high risk of spread at the national and regional levels it did not think that transnational spread beyond bordering countries was likely the committee gave no indication as to whether the noted risk of regional spread met the ihr criterion of a public health risk to other states through international spread however during the third ec meeting on 14 june 2019 the committee acknowledged that recent cases in uganda constitute international spread of disease and considered the outbreak had a risk of international spread the committee called for the drc government who and partners to intensify the response to ensure the situation did not deteriorate during earlier meetings but it did not specifically state a coordinated international response was needed until the fourth meeting during the third ec the committee explicitly reported the event as extraordinary acknowledged the risk of the disease spreading to neighbouring countriesas cases had been reported in ugandaand called for the international community to step up funding and support for the response however the ec still stated that the outbreak did not meet all the three criteria for a pheic at the time1 it was not until the following meeting when the committee stated it was the view of the committee that a coordinated international response under the international health regulations 2005 is required thus the conditions for a public health emergency of international concern pheic under the ihr 2005 have been met3 the ec has met an additional two times and advised for a continuation of a pheic declaration as the committee was concerned that withdrawing the pheic now might have adverse consequences for the response efforts through diminishing focus3 4china notified who of a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown aetiology on 31 december 201920 and the who dg convened the ec approximately 3 weeks later on 2223 january 2020 at the time 557 cases were reported and four countries confirmed exported travel-related cases from china similar to previous ec meetings for mers polio and west africa ebola the first ec meeting for novel coronavirus did not reach a decision on the first day of meeting but continued its deliberations on the next day due to the need for additional information and deliberation in the ec statement the committee noted that it is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country implying an ongoing public health risk to other states via international spread while it was reported that members of the emergency committee expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a pheic or not ultimately a pheic was not declared at the end of 23 january as seen with mers-cov the who dg suggested the ec reconvene in a matter of days to reassess the evolving situation and provide an updated determination on whether the event constitutes a pheic the ec met again on 30 january 2020 when there were 7711 confirmed cases in china and an additional 83 reported cases in 18 other countries at which time the ec agreed that the outbreak now meets the criteria for a public health emergency of international concern the ec reiterated its language from the prior meeting regarding risk of importation indicating an ongoing public health risk to other states via international spread additionally the ec stated in the second meeting that they felt that a global coordinated effort is needed neither the first nor second ec meeting noted whether or not the event was considered extraordinary3 at the time of writing covid-19 was reported in countries on six continents spreading rapidly including through community transmission21figure 13 4 outlines which criteria and thematic factors were explicitly stated or implied as contributing to the ec recommendation to the who dgwe find considerable inconsistency in statements issued by the ec regarding their determination of whether the ihr criteria for a pheic have been met the ecs did not always require each of the three conditions to be met in order to recommend that a pheic should be declared during the first zika ec meeting when a pheic was recommended there was no explicit mention of a risk of international spread nor did the ec state that a coordinated international response was required in contrast the ec determined the yellow fever outbreaks in 2016 did not constitute a pheic even though they stated the outbreaks posed a public health risk to other states through international spread and indicated that enhanced international support was needed3when the ecs did reference specific pheic criteria they were often inconsistent in their interpretation of whether the criteria were met for example for some events h1n1 polio and the west africa evd outbreak ecs interpreted the criterion of requiring a coordinated international response to mean that the event required such coordination but did necessitate that on-going coordination be enhanced or improved in order for the criterion to be met in contrast for the ninth drc evd outbreak the ec argued that while the response should be supported by the entire international community implying the need for a coordinated international response a pheic was not necessary because the existing response was rapid and comprehensive and there was reason to believe the outbreak could be brought under control similarly for the 10th drc evd outbreak in earlier meetings the committee noted the government of the democratic republic of congo who and partners must intensify the current response indicating a coordinated international response was underway however the ec did not acknowledge that the criterion of a coordinated international response was met until the forth ec meeting on 17 july 20193the criterion for determining if an event is considered extraordinary was also interpreted inconsistently for both h1n1 and zika insufficient knowledge about the virus was cited as a factor in these situations being deemed extraordinary events in contrast the ec s never stated that mers-cov and covid-19 both outbreaks resulting from novel viruses for which there were significant gaps in knowledge of disease aetiology constituted an extraordinary event3ecs varied in their interpretation of and the supporting evidence used to assess the criterion of there being a risk of international spread the ec was inconsistent in whether it required that international spread to have already occurred vs there simply being risk that spread could occur in order for this criterion to be met in some cases h1n1 polio west africa evd yellow fever ninth drc evd outbreak 10th drc evd outbreak the ec noted the threat of international spread when a disease involved sustained human-to-human or community transmission however despite the absence of sustained human-to-human transmission the ec considered mers-cov outbreak to have a risk of international spread stating the possibility of international spread remains of concern on 4 february 2015 for polio an impending mass gathering the hajj was used as rationale to continue a pheic declaration due to the risk it posed for international spread however for mers-cov the ec did not note that they considered the hajj a factor that contributed to the risk of international spread the upcoming olympics were also acknowledged during zika ec meetings and it was recognised that mass gatherings can pose additional risks to international spread it was ultimately deemed that with proper public health control measures the risk of the olympics contributing to international spread was negligible and therefore not factored into this criterion3by design this study only reviewed the official statements of ec meetings to identify and analyse the rationale provided and determine if pheic criteria were present or absent most but not all ec meetings were followed by a press conference where the dg and the chair of the ec provided a verbal report of the meeting and answer questions posed by journalists while these press conferences often allowed for further clarification of the ec decision whether or not additional clarifying information was relayed at press conferences was often contingent on the types of questions that happened to be asked by member of the press as a result these conferences cannot be viewed as a replacement for ec reports as a vehicle for explaining the rationale used by the ec in deciding whether an event met each of ihr criteria for a pheic declaration to ensure there is complete understanding of the analysis and decision-making of the ec the official reports of the ec should contain all of the necessary information regarding which ihr criteria were determined to have been transparency in this ihr process must be prioritised and therefore the official ec statements must provide a clear indication of how each of the three ihr criteria were deemed to have been met and include all the relevant information necessary to justify the decision to recommend declaration or not of a pheiclack of consistency and clarity regarding the ec and the who dgs decision-making contributes to ongoing concerns about a lack of transparency in the pheic process and other public disagreements with pheic declarations9 though ecs may have discussed each outbreak with greater clarity and consistency than what was publicly reported it is important that the public representation of the ecs rationale be fully articulated so that member states and outside observers have a full record of the ecs decision-making process lack of transparency surrounding the ec process has been a continuous point of contention for public health experts who noted the original reticence of who to disclose the identity of ec members following the h1n1 ec deliberations22similarly it is important that the ecs recommendations are seen as consistent with the expectations of the ihrwe recommend that in future convenings the ec standardise their reviews of events to specifically address whether the event met each of the three criteria and to list corresponding evidence to support the presenceabsence of each criterion in addition the ec should offer detailed explanation of how they interpreted the criteria in order to standardise the ec review process and ensure explanations are provided to clearly justify decisions on pheic declarations and non-declarations ec members should undergo further training regarding the authorities and decision-making criteria established by the ihr a sentiment that is shared by other public health and international law experts22 notably global health law experts have not been part of the composition of ecs3 4 adding legal expertise to future ec deliberations will help to resolve confusion about the ihr criteria and promote consistency with previous decisionsgoing forward the who should in consultation with member states and legal experts develop clear guidelines to aid ecs in interpreting pheic criteria in particular there seems to be confusion among ec members as to whether the risk of international spread criterion has to involve documented international spread the ihrs do not specify that international spread must have already occurred and it would likely be against the spirit of the ihrs which aim to reduce international spread of infectious diseases for the ecs to need to wait until international spread has occurred in order to declare a pheic1the makeup of the ec is ill-equipped to address political and social considerations while these considerations are important and relevant factors to take into account when responding to an outbreak the ihr does not provide the ecs with the authority to consider the political and social implications the ecs should disavow including these concerns in their deliberations and ensure that they only consider the available technical evidence on whether the three core criteria have or have not been met when determining if the event constitutes a pheic other avenues should be used to account for the political and social considerations as they are a necessary component of ensuring a robust and successful response to a health emergency box 1 provides a summary of the recommendations outlined in this paperwith more consistency and transparency in ec justifications there could be a better understanding on how the ec and the who dg reach their decision on whether an event should be considered a pheic similarly as previous pheic determinations are often reviewed to compare the decision-making processes between public health events a more structured approach should be provided that explicitly states what criteria were met and how the ec determined that each criterion was satisfied this approach will remove some ambiguity and enable the international community to gain further insight into the ecs thought process and their recommendations on whether to declare a pheicit is essential for pheic declarations to be made based on science not politics in recent convenings ecs have seemed reluctant to recommend a pheic declaration noting the potential for countries to respond with trade and travel measures that could harm response to the health event3 23 though concerns that countries may pursue harmful measures to stop the importation of disease are legitimate24 the decision-making process established by the ihr does not accommodate these political considerations1 the ecs should review the potential public health impact of the event and limit their decision-making to a technical assessment of each event the who should address separately outside of the pheic declaration process the problem of member states taking actions that are inconsistent with who recommendations and place unnecessary travel and trade restrictions on affected countries which would be detrimental to both the country and the response effortspheic declarations are not the entire focus of the ihr the regulations also require countries to develop capacities to detect and report potential pheics1 if there is a lack of understanding of the rationale that ec uses to recommend pheic declarations or if pheic declarations are seen to be political it could undermine confidence in the ihr though the ihr are instruments of law their impact depends on countries willingness to comply it is essential for future compliance with the ihr that the who ecs and member states interpret the framework as written if the regulations are thought to be inadequate in supporting assessment and response to international public health emergencies then a revision of the ihr may be necessary following the ecs recommendation to declare the on-going covid-19 epidemic a pheic the who dg expressed frustration with the binary decision-making set up by the ihrs and suggested that a tiered decision-making tool with an intermediary measure may be more useful to gauge the level of emergency posed by health events3 such a suggestion would likely require a revision of the ihr as the decision instrument contained in annex 2 does not accommodate a multi-phase declarationthis first comprehensive review of ec statements found considerable inconsistency in the justifications dictating which criteria were considered to be met and how the criteria were considered to be satisfied recently debates about the value and timing of pheic declarations have also called into question the benefit and impact of pheic declarations25 26 some of these concerns may stem from lack of understanding of ecs rationale and ecs lack of agreement andor understanding of pheic criteria set forth by the ihr striving for more consistency and transparency in the ec justifications around pheic declarations would benefit future deliberations and help to build more understanding and support for the processthe daily number of new cases infected by covid-19 is currently exponentially growing for most countries affected by the virus however this exponential growth rate varies significantly for different regions over the globe it is urgent and timely to understand the reasons behind this regional variation of the exponential growth rates little information is known about this matter while there are indications that the environmental temperature may be a factor for instance northern and colder us and italian regions experienced much more incidents than otherstypically the evolution curve of the spread of the coronavirus initiates with a pre-exponential phase which is characterized by a mild logarithmic growth followed by the outbreak that is the phase of the exponential growth social-distancing measures against the spread may affect the evolution curve in a way that the exponential growth slows down decelerated phase and starts to decline decline or decay phase 1 depending though on the effectiveness and applicability of these measures however after the decline of the spread at some place new infected cases may outbreak in other places marked with insignificant number of cases until that moment then a newly growth phase may appear for example fig 1 left shows the evolution curve of the spread for the infected cases in mainland china clearly we observe the whole growthdecay cycle as well as a new re-growth phasesuper-strict measures such as complete shut down and quarantines can successfully lead to the deceleration of the exponential growth of infected cases 2 unfortunately they cannot be successfully applied and followed within vast regions and especially for a long and indefinite period of time inevitably measures may be loosened during the decay phase  if not earlier leading to the birth of an equally disastrous re-growth phasethe exponential growth is the most effective phase for the evolution curve of infected cases and the most important question regarding this evolution is still open 3 what can influence the exponential growth rate and thus flatten the curve measures strict or not may affect the evolution of new infected cases by shifting the spread curve from the exponential to the decelerated growth it should be noted though that measures do not affect the exponential growth rate itself but only the period of time that this exponential phase applies then what factors do affect the exponential growth ratethe age distribution in the place where the outbreak occurs is unlikely to be a factor indeed the number of new cases is known to be positively correlated with age however the exponential growth rate china 0169 us 0121 italy 0090 decreasing rate appears to be negatively correlated to the age median of these countries china 374 us 381 italy 455 increasing age hence the age is likely irrelevant to the rate variationsin addition culture in social activities may be a factor for example this might be contributing in the observed differences among the exponential rates in the cases of china italy and us fig 1 however what is causing the major variation of exponential rates among different regions of the same culture it is apparent that culture does not constitute the main factor influencing the exponential ratefig 2 shows the regional variation of infected cases left during the exponential growth phase and the average winter temperature right in italy the possible negative correlation observed between regional number of infected cases and winter temperature in italy is an indication of the influence of temperature on the exponential growth but it certainly does not constitute a necessary condition the reason is that the map plots the total number of the infected cases nt which is not dependent only on the exponential growth rate  but also on the initial number of cases n0it is generally accepted that the initial infected cases in italy were travelled directly from china since some destinations are more favorable than others then the initial number of cases n0 as well as the current number of cases nt which is proportional to n0 should be subject of regional variation therefore there is a non-negligible possibility the observed regional variation of the number of infected cases nt to be caused by the regional distribution of the initial cases n0 in such a case main airport cities would have incredibly high number of infected cases outplaying a possible negative correlation of daily infected cases with regional average temperature t the latter may be one of the reasons of the high numbers of cases observed in new york city and romeon the other hand in their letter to the white house members of a national academy of sciences committee said that there is some evidence to suggest that coronavirus may transmit less efficiently in environments with higher ambient temperature and humidity however given the lack of host immunity globally this reduction in transmission efficiency may not lead to a significant reduction in disease spread without the concomitant adoption of major public health interventions 4nevertheless it has to be stressed out that there were no statistical analyses focused on the exponential growth rates of the infected cases in regions with different temperatures for instance several authors eg 5 6 found insignificant correlations between temperatures and confirmed cases however their analysis was performed on the number of the infected cases nt which is subject to the randomness of the initial cases n0 as explained above and not on the exponential growth rate  which is clearly dependent on physical characteristics of the coronavirus binding protein and environmentanalysis of regional cases can show whether the speculated negative correlation between temperature and number of infected cases is true meaning a negative correlation between temperature and exponential growth rate if the environmental temperature plays indeed a substantial role on the virus spread then this can provide promising results such as the estimation of the critical temperature that may eliminate the number of daily new cases in heavily infected regionsthe purpose of this paper is to improve our understanding of the effect of environmental temperature on the spread of covid-19 and its exponential growth rate in particular we calculate the exponential growth rates of infected cases for us and italian regions derive the relationship of these rates with the environmental temperature evaluate its statistical confidence and determine the critical temperature that eliminates this ratea standard model for describing the evolution of the infected cases by viruses can be constructed as follows

where xtntnmax x0n0nmax nt is the number of total infected cases evolved from the initial n0n0 cases nmax is the maximum possible number of infected cass  is the exponential growth rate and becomes clear for xt 1 where i is negligible leading to
xtx0exptorntn0exptforx1whereix12atypically data of infected cases are daily provided and updated thus we set the readout of nt on a daily basis such as ntntd hence we may write
xtx0exptorntn0expt2b
with where xtntnmax with t indicating the time on a daily basis t  1d 2d the function of negative feedback i models the factors that flattens the curve such as the measures taken against spreading while these factors are not affecting the exponential growth rate  they become more effective as the number of cases increases getting closer to nmax exponent b controls the effectiveness of these factors strict loose measures correspond to smaller larger values of bfig 3 shows the evolution curve of the number of new nt  nt1nt and total infected cases nt as well as how this curve flattens for stricter measures ie smaller values of bas observed in fig 3a stricter measures nicely modeled by decreasing b do not affect the exponential rate  but they successfully flatten the curve however the same can be achieved by downgrading the exponential growth rate as shown in fig 3bit is apparent then how much useful would it be to know the factors that can flatten the curve by decreasing directly the exponential growth rate instead of applying stricter measures applied measures could be loosen and shortermodel 1 originates from the logistic map family eg 7 and references therein 8 other complicate versions such as the susceptibleinfectiousrecovered models eg 9 may be expressed by multi-dimensional differential or difference equations eg 10 and references therein 11 but still the curve flattening is governed by the same features the two composites the exponential growth e and the negative feedback i are just the main and necessary conditions for reproducing the growth-decay phases of the spread curve their interplay shows how the spread curve can be flattened as a result of stricter measures independently of the existent exponential ratewhat are the main factors that can affect the exponential growth rate  of covid-19 spreadthe rate  is expected to have positive correlation with the reproduction number r0 eg proportional to its logarithm and negative correlation with the incubation period  eg inverse proportional 12 the number r0 is a measure of how contagious a disease is it provides the average number of people in a susceptible population that a single infected person will spread the disease over the course of their infection 9 and depends on the physical characteristics of coronavirus 13 the incubation period  is the time elapsed between exposure to coronavirus and first symptoms during this period an infected individual cannot infect others other characteristic periods and time intervals are the latent period between exposure and infection and the generation time mostly concerned with transmission process 14 characteristic values for covid-19 are 56 days and r024 15 the rate expression can be written as lnr0 and involves all the physical characteristics of the mechanisms of infection and the environmental interactions this can be easily derived considering difference equations that is iterated discrete maps eg see 1618 setting the time to be given in discrete -steps t  1 2 then by definition of r0 average number of people that a single infected person will spread the disease we have nt  r0nt that is
ntr0ntr0tn0thus3a
ntn0exp1lnr0t3bwe note that the number of the infected cases does not vary for times t taken in-between the integer multiples of  but this is not expected in mixtures of populations with random characteristics indeed in a mixture of m evolving infected populations with different initial number of cases n0m and starting times t0m m  1 2  m the total number of infected cases n at a continuous time t is given by

withn0m1mn0mexp1lnr0t0i3d
which coincides with 3b but with time t varying on a daily basis independently of the larger value of   5 days 15 therefore we set the readout of the total number of infected cases n on a daily basis such as ntntd then eq 3d matches eq 2b
ntn0exp1lnr0tn0expt4
where the exponential rate is given by
lnr05the main factors that can affect the exponential rate  are a culture in social activities and b environmental temperature andor other thermodynamic parameters intense cultural and social activities have reasonably a positive correlation with r0 as previously mentioned measures against the virus spread do not effectively influence the exponential growth rate eg they do not change the culture in social activities which are characteristics of the particular population but they just cease these social activities for some period of time in terms of modeling measures appear only in the negative feedback factor i and not in the e factor of model in eq 1 while the culture together with the environmental temperature are the two main parameters affecting r0 directly potentially the environmental temperature t can affect all the parameters influencing exponential rate we approach this dependence by i a linear approximation of the phenomenological relationship between exponential rate and temperature and ii the connection of reproduction number with arrhenius behavior with negative activation energyi the temperature can affect the physical properties of coronavirus such as the incubation time  as well as the reproduction number r0 that depends on these physical properties 13 a linear approximation absorbs the weak temperature dependence of any parameters involved in the exponential rate then eq 5 is linearly expanded as
t1lnr0ntptntptntptot26
where we set the intercept to be given in normal conditions of atmospheric temperature and pressure ntp that is t  20 c0 p  1atm then we rewrite the exponential rate as
t01tc1twith7a
01lnr0ntptntptntpp20tc1tntp7b
where 0 and p2 are the intercept and slope of the linear relation 7aii coronavirus uses their major surface spike protein to bind on a receptoranother protein that acts like a doorway into a human cell 19 the whole process is a slow chemical reaction where the mechanism behind can lead to rates negatively correlated with temperature ie increasing rate with decreasing temperature this is consistent to reaction rate expressed by the arrhenius exponential with negative activation energy expeakbt 20 then the effective reproduction number r0t is expressed as a product combining the reproduction number in the absence of temperature effect r0 and the arrhenius exponential rate namely
r0tr0expeakbtwithr0r0ntpexpeakbtntp8then eq 5 gives
t1eakbtntplnr0ntp1eakbt19we rewrite this expression as

01eakbtntplnr0ntpp20tceakb10b
where 0 and p2 are the intercept and slope of the linear relation 10a respectivelyreactions of negative activation energy are barrier-less relying on the capture of the molecules in a potential well increasing decreasing the temperature leads to a reduced gained probability of the colliding molecules capturing one another due to the negative activation energy decreasing the environmental temperature reduces the probability of virus-protein reaction thus the virus may stay inactive on air or surfaces and eventually dieexponential growth is related to community spread through outdoors activities while the decelerated growth caused by effective measures is related to indoors activities exponential growth exists once the disease is still effective and the measures are loosened allowing people to outdoor social activities however exponential growth decelerates followed by the decay phase once effective measures hold people in small groups indoors therefore exponential growth rate must be related to outdoors rather than indoors activities and thus to the environmental temperature as long as the exponential growth takes place the environmental temperature has an effective role on the chemical reaction between virus and spike proteinit should be noted that both the models 7b and 10b consider that the exponential rate  or the reproduction number r0 are subject to a component influenced by the culture in social activities intercept 0 and a component mostly influenced by the temperature linear term with slope p2 in this way the slope may indicate some universal quantity involved such as the negative activation energynext we employ the above two expressions of exponential rate  and temperature t eqs 7a and 10a in order to set the two types of statistical models for fitting   measurements for us and italian regionswe use publicly available datasets of 1 average environmental temperature of us and italian regions eg see wwwncdcnoaagovdata-accessland-based-station-dataland-based-datasetsclimate-normals itclimate-dataorg wwwweather-atlascom 2 time series of the number of daily infected cases of us and italian regions eg see wwwthelancetcom wwwprotezionecivilegovitwe analyze the datasets of regional infected cases in us and italy derive the relationship of the exponential growth rate of the number of cases with temperature and evaluate its statistical confidence first we derive the exponential growth rates of the infected cases characterizing each examined region of us and italy then we plot these values against the environmental temperatures of each region and perform the corresponding statistical analysis we proceed according to the following stepsthe hypothesis to be tested is that the exponential growth rate  varies linearly with temperature x is set to be the temperature or its inverse this is tested by examining the chi-square corresponding to the fitting of the two-parameter linear statistical model xp1p2  p1p2x to the given n data points the number of data point n should not to be confused with the number of cases nt therefore we minimize the chi-square 2p1p2i1nip22ip1p2xi2 where the total variance that characterize each data point is now given by ip22  i2p22xi2 21 the global minimum of the chi-square function 2p1p2 gives the optimal parameter values p1p2 by solving the normal equations 2p1p2p1  0 and 2p1p2p2  0 the minimum chi-square value is min22p1p2 the statistical errors of these values are given by pstred2h1   12 where h is the hessian matrix of the chi-square at the global minimum and h1 is the -th diagonal element of its inverse matrix 2223 red21n2min2 is the reduced chi-square value for degrees of freedom dof equal to m  n-2 the propagation errors of the measurements xixiiii1n are given by pprpxi2x2ipi22i   12 where the derivatives are numerically derivedwe will use two linear statistical models a t  01tc1t and b t1  01tct1 as given by eqs 7a and 10a both can be written with the linear expression

ixtp10p20tc1andiixt1p10p20tc11bthe statistical confidence of the dependence of the exponential growth rate on the environmental average temperature may be sufficiently high leading to the acceptance of any of the two statistical models the goodness of the fitting of each model is evaluated using two types of statistical tests the reduced chi-square the p-value of the extremes and their combination eg 2426 while students t-test is also used for evaluating the statistical confidence of the derived slopesthe linear fitting of log nt or log nt with respect to time t within the region of exponential growth phase resulted to the respective rates which are given by the fitted slopes their weighted averages are shown in table 1 for us and in table 2 for italian regions while plotted against the average regional temperature in figs 5 and 6 respectively the method of weighted fitting for double uncertainties xixi ii as described by 21 is used for estimating the fitting parameters 0 tc together with their statistical propagation and total errors the fits of the linear statistical model with temperature xi  ti left panels in figs 5 and 6 as well as of the alternative statistical model with inverse temperature xi  ti-1 xi  titi-2 right panels in figs 5 and 6 are both characterized with high statistical confidence attaining high p-values 005 and reduced chi-squares red2 values close to 1 also both fits provide similar estimations of tc the fitting results are shown in table 3we also examine whether the sample points titi ii are subject to statistically significant concentrations or rarefactions namely whether possible heterogeneities within the distribution of sample points plays significant role in the fitted relationship for this we derive the temperature-rate relationship and its statistical confidence by fitting the homogenized set of sample points instead of the raw sample points then we examine whether the fitting parameters differ from those derived from fitting the raw sample points we homogenize the sample points by grouping them in temperature bins of t  1 c0 eg see 29 we estimate the weighted mean and error of the rates included in each bin in the case of us regions we also performed a homogenization of rates by grouping the temperature-binned means in rate bins of   001 d-1 in the case of sample points with inverse temperatures ti-1ti-1 ii the procedure is exactly the same homogenized datasets result in a smooth relationship between the values of binned temperature and rate as it can be observed in the plots of rate against temperature or inverse temperature left or right lower panels respectively and for both us and italy regions figs 5 and 6 respectively the results are highly supportive of the negative correlation between rate and temperature the results are shown in table 4 we observe that the linear relationships of the growth rate with temperature or inverse temperature are characterized by high statistical confidence for the homogenized datasets p-values much higher than the significant limit of 005 red2 far from the significant limits of 01 and 10 therefore the arrangement of sample points do not affect significantly the fitting resultsin addition as shown in tables 3 and 4 the linear fits of sample points titi ii and ti-1ti-1 ii do not pass the students t-test for the null hypothesis that their slopes equals zero ie the corresponding pt-values are smaller than the acceptable confidence limit of 005 therefore the negative correlation of environmental temperature with the exponential rate is statistically significant accepted with confidence 95in order to improve the statistics of the estimated critical temperature we combine the sample points titi ii of us and italian regions first we perform the students t-test to compare the slopes from these regions we find high pt-values 005 for both fits of x  t and x  t-1 thus the two populations are likely characterized by the same slope the respective intercept 0 does not pass the same test ie the intercepts corresponding to us and italian regions are likely different that is expected given of the different culture a universality may characterize the slopes of two countries either for the fits with x  t or x  t-1 ie p2  tntp or p2  eakb respectivelynext we perform the linear fits of the sample points titi ii and ti-1ti-1 ii for the mixed set of us and italian data once the rates of the italian regions are shifted by  this is allowed since it has just be shown that a universality is likely characterized the slopes the optimal fitting is obtained for that shift  for which the reduced chi-square is 1 the p-value of the extremes is 05 and the combined measure 0 see previous section fig 7 shows how the combined datasets of temperature-rates from us and italian regions lead to the optimal fitting note that the optimization is not performed for the binned datasets since they are characterized by smaller p-valuessee figs 5 and 6 the results are shown in table 5 we observe that the optimization is reached for two values of the shift  we estimate the weighted average of the results corresponding to the two shifts the weighted mean is performed separately for the fitting cases of x  t and x  t-1 however the weighted mean of the critical temperature is performed for all four resultstable 5 includes the weighted means of slopes for the fits x  t or x  t-1 with slopes p2  tntp and p2  eakb respectively the latter can be used for deriving the activation energy where   5211 d 15 where we find ea  02120057 ev the value of the critical temperature is tc  303224 k 86143 f0 or 30124 c0 in addition using eqs 7b and 19b we derive the reproduction number r0 ie

1lnr0ntp0xt1tntptc11lnr0ntp0xt1tctntp112bthe two formulae in eq 12b provide the value of 1lnr0ntp as 0057200098 and 0053400146 respectively with weighted mean 0056000084 then we find r0ntp134010 that is the reproduction number for t  20 c0 the corresponding number at t  0 c0 is r00c0247045 while by substituting the estimated parameters in eq 8 we derive the general relationship for any temperature expressed in k also plotted in fig 8
r0tc01334010exp2450660t129315113up-to-date there is no systematic statistical analysis of the effect of the environmental temperature t and possibly other weather parameters on the exponential growth rate of the cases infected by covid-19 while a statistically confident relationship between temperature and growth rate either with positive or negative correlation was unknownthe presented analysis led to the first statistically confident relationship of negative correlation between the exponential growth rate and the average environmental temperature derived for us and italian regions in particular we analyzed datasets of regional infected cases in us and italy derived the exponential growth rates for each of these regions and plotted them against environmental temperatures averaged within the same regions derived the relationship of temperaturegrowth rate and evaluated its statistical confidencethe performed statistical analysis involved fitting of linear statistical models with the datasets of environmental temperature or its inverse and exponential growth rate the two linear models developed and used for the statistical analysis are a t  01tc1t and b t1  01tct1 the statistical confidence of fitting was evaluated using the reduced chi-square values the p-value of extremes and a testing measure that combines both of these values also the students t-test was used to compare the derived slopesthe sample points of temperature or inverse temperature and exponential growth rate were also tested for statistically significant concentrations or rarefactions that is for possible heterogeneities within the distribution of sample points that could have significant role in the results the statistical analysis of the homogenized temperature-rate data points concluded that the negative correlation between temperature and exponential rate is stable having no statistically significant variability due to concentrations or rarefactions and it is characterized by a high statistical confidencewe also performed a students t-test and ensured that the difference between the sample means of us and italian regions is not statistically significant a universality is likely characterizing the slope of the temperature-rate relationship this verifies the modeling developed and used by this analysis where the exponential rate  or the reproduction number r0 are subject to a component influenced by the culture in social activities intercept 0 and a component influenced by the temperature slope p2 in this way the slope may indicate to a universal quantity involved such as the negative activation energyhaving shown that the derived slopes for us and italian regions are characterized by no statistically confident difference we improved the statistics of the estimated fitting parameters by combined the sample points of us and italian regions from the derived relationship among others we were able to estimate the values of the negative activation energy ea as well as the reproduction number r0 at normal conditions and how this depends on temperaturetherefore the results clearly showed that there is indeed statistically significant negative correlation of temperature on the exponential growth rate of the cases infected by covid-19 fig 9 shows the anti-correlation between the mapped exponential rates and average environmental temperature of the us regions examined by this analysis which they are characterized by a readable exponential growth phase in their evolution spread curvegiven the negative correlation of the environmental temperature with the exponential growth rate it was reasonable to ask for the critical temperature that eliminates the exponential rate and thus the number of daily new cases in infected regions this was found to be tc861  43 f0 for us regions it is straightforward to ask when the environmental temperature will climb above this critical value as an example fig 10 plots the daily average temperatures in san antonio texas shown that it will be clearly above the estimated tc threshold by the end of maythe resulted high statistical confidence of the negative correlation of the environmental temperature on the exponential growth rate of the cases infected by covid-19 is certainly encouraging for loosening super-strict social-distancing measures at least during the summery high temperatures however we are by no-means recommending a return-to-work date based only on this study but we do think that this should be part of the decision as well as an inspiration for repeating the same analysis in other heavily infected regions the steps of these analyses may be followed aspandemics are a regular feature of human history from ancient times onwards mcneill 1976 as major eruptions of the harsh realities of nature into the settled life of civilisations for it is civilisations that suffer from them for various reasons they loom large in historical accounts and the memoirs of those who lived through them historically pandemics have brought about sweeping social political and cultural change  or at least they seem to have done so for the reality is that they give a massive push to movements and trends that were already under way in the extreme cases pandemics have figured largely in the collapse of empires and civilisations as for example in the havoc the bubonic plague wrought on both the eastern roman and sasanian empires in the sixth century little 2006 in the modern world since around 1750 their impact has been less dramatic but it is still considerable there have been almost 20 pandemics in the modern era and they have played a central part in the development and growth of the modern state there is also an inescapable economic aspect to pandemics in terms of both their dynamics the way they spread and the reasons why they appear when and where they do and their consequences among which economic impacts loom largeit is important to understand what a pandemic is and how it is distinct from an ordinary and localised epidemic outbreak the latter is a constant feature of human life an infectious disease will break out in a particular location and initially spread rapidly among the local population which may be large after a while the rate of growth slows down and eventually stops with the number of cases peaking there is then an almost equally rapid decline so the path of an epidemic resembles an inverted v sometimes however the epidemic spreads widely beyond its original point of origin and becomes extensively dispersed geographically such an epidemic is commonly called a pandemic although strictly speaking that term should be used only for the ultimate case of an epidemic that has diffused so widely that outbreaks are found at roughly the same time all over the populated planeta pandemic has a different pattern from that of a local epidemic the disease which is typically novel and caused by a new or mutated pathogen appears at one point on the planet it then spreads along trade routes and travel routes to other parts of the world tatem rogers  hay 2006 travellers tourists today but also pilgrims and business travellers merchants and soldiers are historically the major carriers mcneill 1976 the transmission at this point is not geographically continuous instead the disease spreads along trade routes from one trade hub to another leaping over intervening territory this leads to widespread and scattered nearsimultaneous outbreaks across the world which can then in turn lead to further transmission this is the first phase of the pandemic eventually these localised outbreaks subside in the same way as a truly local epidemic doeshowever in a pandemic that is not the end of the story the epidemic now enters a second phase usually called the smouldering phase viboud grais lafont miller  simonsen 2005 in this phase the disease spreads out from the original foci and becomes much more widely and uniformly dispersed this phase is marked by scattered outbreaks on a small scale so the overall number of cases does not rise or does so slowly gradually however the local outbreaks start to coalesce and after some time which depending on the pathogen can be anything from a few months to several years the third phase is entered this is a second wave of accelerating infection but much more widely dispersed and uniform than the first one although some of the areas most hard hit in the first phase get off lightly because of higher levels of acquired immunity cockburn delon  fereira 1969 kindrachuk  nickol 2019 this third phase or second wave is typically much larger than the first wave in terms of both the number of cases and the geographical spread and often does far more damage with viral pathogens the second wave is often more virulent than the first this happened for example in the spanish flu pandemic of 191819 but it can be milder kilbourne 2006 potter 2001 spinney 2018 after the third phase the epidemic becomes quiescent again but it often returns in a third and even a fourth wave these however are almost always milder than the earlier waves in terms of their medical effectshow then does the covid19 pandemic of 2020 fit into that kind of story clearly it is not on the same scale as the truly massive ones of the past such as the antonine plague of the second century probably smallpox or the plague of justinian in the sixth century and the black death in the fourteenth both of these being bubonic plague these all killed upwards of 25 per cent of the affected populations a truly devastating mortality rate benedictow 2018 horrox 1994 little 2006 mcneill 1976 by contrast covid19 appears so far to have an infection fatality rate of around 0607 per cent so much milder than those cases but also several times worse than regular seasonal influenza the medical effect is so far much less than that of the spanish flu pandemic of 191819 although it may end up being slightly worse than in the asian flu and hong kong flu pandemics 195758 and 196869 respectively the covid19 virus is seemingly less infectious than influenza but has a longer incubation period and a very high proportion of asymptomatic cases which means it still spreads widely the major differences from the past are the greater medical capacity available in terms of both knowledge and actual resources and the greater administrative capacity of modern states in 191819 local controls often sweeping were imposed but there were nothing like the national responses seen in 2020 spinney 2018 policies of lockdown initially and testing tracing and isolating tti subsequently may smother the smouldering phase and prevent a second wave or third phase this time holding the line until a vaccine is developed countries that were able to put a programme of tti in place early on such as south korea have avoided the need for a strict lockdownat the time of writing may 2020

 we still do not know whether we will escape a third phase one problem is that the development and spread of the virus is at every stage a complex system in the technical sense of that term that is we cannot simply extrapolate existing trends or predict from initial conditions and parameters how things will work out subsequently in addition too much is still not known most notably the proportions of populations that have already been infected and are consequently now immune what evidence we have suggests an infection rate in most places of between 2 per cent and 20 per cent ahlander  pollard 2020 urra 2020 the problem is that this means populations are a long way from socalled herd immunity where the number of susceptible people in a given population is at a level where one case will give rise to fewer than one new case because of the physical difficulty of finding a vulnerable person this level is at least 60 per cent for a virus with the known features of covid19 all this means that policymakers are operating in a situation analogous to the fog of war with incomplete or absent information and constantly and unpredictably changing circumstances they face an acute knowledge problem in other words given this it will be a major achievement if controls and other measures do succeed in dousing the smouldering stage of the pandemicthe experience of the past and the way pandemics have happened tell us a number of things because the initial spread beyond a locality is a function of transmission along channels such as trade and travel routes including pilgrimage ones very widespread epidemics are almost by definition cases where an epidemic has reached every part of an ecumene that is a part of the planet that is economically integrated through trade and exchange today that means the entire planet in the past for the entire planet to be reached the pathogen would take several steps geographically going through the cycle described above in each step we can see this in the black death for example today because of air travel and things such as austrian ski holidays the coronavirus was able to spread from wuhan in china to the whole planet in a matter of just weeks in 191819 the time it took spanish flu to travel from one part of the world to another was measured in months all this leads to the conclusion that several features of the world we live in such as high levels of economic integration and trade widespread mass travel and rapid modes of transport make it much more vulnerable to a true pandemic to that list we should add such things as the nature of modern livestock farming and acute pressure on wildlife habitats both of which contribute significantly to the appearance of novel pathogens and transmission from animals to humansthese and other features of the modern world also mean that the economic impact of an extensive epidemic is going to be much greater than was the case in for example 196869 international travel is now a much more significant and valuable activity so its curtailment will have much bigger effects much manufacturing and other economic activity now depends on long and complex supply chains that again will be disrupted by both the epidemic itself and the measures taken to contain it changes in consumption patterns also make contemporary economies more vulnerable for example in the last three decades americans have taken to eating out more and more to the point where just over half of the food consumed is eaten in bars and restaurants these have been closed down but even before then their trade had collapsed this has had a much bigger effect than would have been the case in 1968 not least because the entire food supply system is now geared up to sending half its output to restaurants rather than grocery stores and it is extremely difficult to adjust quickly to restaurant closure bedford 2020 there are similar examples in other areas such as clothing purchasing another change is the much greater significance of credit with far more businesses highly leveraged and operating on very tight margins this means that a prolonged interruption to normal business conditions will have its effect amplified by finance in a way that was not true 50 years ago one social change that also has this effect is the movement of women with children into the labour force in large numbers  this magnifies the economic impact of school closures keoghbrown wrenlewis edmunds beutels  smith 2009all this means that a pandemic such as the hong kong flu is going to have bigger effects if it were to happen today than the original did back in 196869 the covid19 virus is on the evidence more medically severe so we should expect it to have if anything a still larger impact at first sight it would seem obvious that the measures taken by governments to try to suppress the spread of the virus and head off a second wave by stamping out the smouldering phase have in turn increased that impact even further massively so certainly the impact has been dramatic with a record rise in us unemployment claims and a dramatic rise in claims for universal credit in the uk most businesses are presently shut down in the uk and elsewhere and only measures such as the furlough scheme introduced into the uk have prevented a rise in unemployment not seen since the dark days of 1931 given a collapse in gdp that some commentators estimate to be the worst since the 1690s or 1700s bruce 2020 faulconbridge  bruce 2020however initial forecasts indicate that the additional impact of lockdowns is far less than most imagine there is no clear correlation between the severity of lockdown and the size of the hit to gdp with countries such as sweden that have avoided lockdowns and gone instead for social distancing predicted to see a decline in gdp similar to the ones expected in countries that did impose one milne 2020 moreover the early signs are that lockdowns may not have had such a dramatic effect on rates of infection and rapidity of spread during the first phase of this pandemic it seems that it is measures such as effective tti policy closing of borders and successfully protecting vulnerable groups such as the elderly that have had the biggest effect the tentative but increasingly strong conclusion is that it was the spontaneous responses and reactions of the public that brought about both the medical effect of slower spread and the bulk of the economic impact this also highlights the fragility of much of the contemporary economywhat kinds of administrative and political effects have pandemics had historically and how might that play out this time one important point is that pandemics seldom lead to something truly novel they typically provide a big boost to processes that were already under way they do not bring down institutions and systems that are in good shape but they do precipitate the collapse and end of ones that were already in a poor state so most of the firms or sectors that go under will be ones that were already having serious difficulty or were already vulnerable such as retail we will see the same pattern in politics the pandemic will lead to a resurgence of nationalism and the nation state while undermining a rulesbased international order and supranational forms of governance unfortunately it will boost the trend towards protectionism and economic nationalism that is already under way it will also lead to a decline in international integration as supply chains are shortened and production reshored in response to revealed vulnerabilities again this is already under way it will almost certainly trigger a financial crisis centred on the unsustainable accumulation of private debt this again being a case of it providing the push that brings down something that is already on the verge of falling overhistorically pandemics have played a central part in the emergence of the modern administrative state through the creation of modern systems of public health in response to major epidemics it was the six great cholera pandemics of the nineteenth century that were particularly important for this leading as they did to governments acquiring extensive powers to inspect regulate and register their populations and to the state taking on responsibility for sanitation and providing potable water wilford 2008 they also led to a profound change in the way large towns and cities were administered and subsequently to the development of an extensive and often coercive set of public health programmes such as compulsory vaccination as well as health visitors and district nurses to support but also chivvy and push the general publicit seems likely that the coronavirus pandemic will therefore lead to a reassessment of the extent power and functions of government in some areas this will result in a growth or extension of powers but in others there will likely be a pulling back or withdrawal as public administration is found to be lacking or selfdefeating a lot of regulations particularly ones to do with medicines and drugs but also things such as occupational licensure in the united states in particular are likely to be cut back or abolished in contrast surveillance powers are probably going to become more extensive one likely change is in the area of health services in most countries east asian ones and germany are the big exceptions these have come to be dominated by hospitals and therapeutic medicine at the expense of health maintenance and public health hawe yuen  baillie 2011 this has been revealed as brittle and highly vulnerable to shocks such as a major epidemic in 2020 it was panic about the pressure on hospital systems that led to the decision to impose a lockdown in most cases one area where there will be much debate is over the relative performance and effectiveness of decentralised and localised systems as compared to centralised or national ones this is actually an area where the evidence can support both sides with the correct answer differing according to local circumstancesthe pandemic will also have other less predictable effects but some of these can already be discerned and others can be guessed at from historical experience one rather grim result will be a heightening of international tensions particularly between china and both the us and europe there may be significant consequences for education and higher education in particular despite what some hope or fear there are unlikely to be lasting consequences for pedagogy but the financial and organisational structure of the higher education industry is likely to face dramatic disruption and reorganisation on a worldwide basis another area that will probably see a major impact in some countries is welfare policy where the idea of a universal basic income already gaining support of late is going to move to the centre of debateon the historical evidence there will also be unpredictable but extensive cultural effects cantor 2001 usually there is a simultaneous movement towards both greater seriousness and impatience with intellectual frivolity on the one hand and a desire to live for the moment and take pleasure where it may be found on the other other things are simply a matter of guesswork or too often projection of hopes and fears perhaps there will be a revulsion against the way everyday work is organised and away from a system where almost all adults are employed perhaps working from home will become a new normal or alternatively people will be desperate for the company of a workplace there may well be an uptick in the birth rate as one person observed to me if lockdown does not get the uk birth rate back above replacement level nothing willwithin the quickly evolving mediasocial media landscape i can think of what appear to be several major media andor social events in recent timesnoting full-well that by the time this article is published they may not even be recognizableincluding the khashoggi killing the covington school student debacle the parkland shooting the kavanaugh nomination the thai cave recue the british royal wedding the manifestations in haiti the never-ending quest to build a wallbarrierfence between the usa and mexico and the politicalhumanitarian crisis in venezuela among many others i apologize for the usa-centric focus here as a canadian i am fully cognizant of the depth and reach of usa tentacles thinking control power and influence in and on my own work as well as on many others even though i collaborate widely with colleagues in diverse jurisdictions and contexts notably in latin america the usa and its interests bleed over to every region of the world and although united statesians the concept of american is hotly contested and does not cover all of the peoples of the americas may not be talking collectively in a central way about the world or may not be collectively immersed in ingratiating the usa into the infinite number of political and economic issues concerns and cultural representations of the other countries and peoples the world is watching listening and being consumed by the behemoth of usa empirethe covid-19 pandemic also squarely places the usa within the core of the action with daily pronouncements about blaming china cutting off funding to the world health organization downplaying the spread of the virus boasting about how the virus has been beaten back and spreading the political and economic reach of this country far and wide in military diplomatic commercial and potentially humanitarian ways it seems as though the reality of this being a global pandemic a far-reaching health crisis is only partially the story and the present manifestations in the usa of people demanding that isolation be stopped while so many are being infected and even dying is almost incomprehensible and social media concurrently exposes denounces disseminates and provides an echo chamber for what is taking placeso i question what becomes news indeed viral and how does it become more than click-bait algorithmic entertainment the bouncing around in limited like-minded networks tepid sharing and a platform for trolls is it about numbers the quantity of clicks views shares and reads or something more substantive at the same time what are the true dimensions of the issues who frames it how and why and to what end what is omitted downplayed obfuscated how and why in the list of issues in the previous paragraph we can think of many pitfalls foibles and problematic concerns as to what issues look like in democracy 20 all issues are not simply a usa problem but connections to elites hegemony power differentials and media framing are i believe worth establishing and interrogating what is clear is that power differentials are at play in how fake news is constructed disseminated understood and engaged with the more volatile social media can push up against normative media in further determining how fake news can be projected masked embellished and consumedconcerning the jamal khashoggi killing in october 2018 in istanbul bbc news 2019 we can follow the usual process of focusing on hegemonic interests and avoiding contextual factors and backdrops several significant and pivotal factors were down- or under-played in reporting on this tragedy for example the relationship to the saudi kingdom human rights billions upon billions of dollars in armaments sold to the saudis the unimaginable assault by saudi arabia against yemen and the impending famine and genocide in yemen as a result womens rights journalistic freedom and an unending series of beheadings by the quasi-untouchable saudi regime undoubtedly information discussion debate reports and mobilization on all of these fronts can be located and advanced through social media in spite of the mainstream hegemonic vision the point here is that central controlled and manufactured debate at least within a condensed and constrained optic and timeframe shined a light on the actual killing of khashoggi in turkey who did it how and why yet significantly it was only weakly concerned with the other what couldshould be considered to be highly pertinent and central issues that arewere intertwined within this quagmire why such deference was paid to the saudi leadership in this case when this same deference is not paid in many other instances especially when the faulty regime is not an ally is quite pertinentthe lack of historical political and economic context combined with the propensity to avoid latching onto research and a plurality of visions perspectives and experiences seem to be a predominant feature of how these stories crystallize the khashoggi example like others contains an evolving set of circumstances and frames as well as questions and we are cognizant of how some segments of social media can provide differing narratives that can consequently re-shape the official story yet the social media dimensions can also counter the formal hegemonic narrative and this is where alternative forms of democracy can start to take hold jenkins shresthova gamber-thompson kligler-velenchik and zimmerman 2016why the more critical dimensions within the khashoggi case or the venezuela situation or others for that matter wereare not more broadly taken up by democracy 10 relates i believe to the hegemonic shapingframing of the issues it is also combined with a weakly focused mainstream media whose reach is now consumed within the fake news bubble and a still questionable place at least among many formal political leaders and their business sector supports of uncontrolled social movements and social media within formal political spheres however i do believe that this last factorsocial movements and social media being a mobilizing forceis and will continue to potentially be central to conceptualizing developing cultivating building and elaborating a more decent meaningful robust and critically engaged democracy in spite of the status quo aiming to maintain and sustain its hegemonic placesocial media movements can also lead to dictatorship genocide and an infringement of rights sapra 2020 for instance gayo-avello 2015 hypothesizes that social media may contribute but is not the central feature to democratization
in short social media is not a democratizing catalyzer per se it is just one of many factors in addition to great tactical tools provided the conditions in the nondemocratic country are suitable moreover there are many variables which can negatively affect the outcome of any uprising even without the regime tampering with social media in other words social media does not make people free freedom requires people taking risks and organizing themselves gayo-avello 2015 6
social media cannot magically lead to class consciousness anti-racism peace and social solidarity however it may be able to provide an outlet and legs to important stories events and realities for people who were only previously loosely connected this could have a dual effect of further questioning and delegitimizing normative democracy and also providing space and voice for marginalized interests perspectives and arguments social media is now indelibly a part of the citizen participation landscapewhat is the point of living in a democracy if you are one of those living in abject poverty are homeless and are working tirelessly to make ends meet but never achieve economic justice ely yamin 2020 of course the notion of having the freedom to pursue your dreams as in the american dream is sufficiently grounded within normative debates to ensure that questioning entrenched systemic institutional deeply grounded social inequalities will be quickly snuffed out within the usa context amadeo 2019 highlights the increasing social inequalities as follows
structural inequality seems to be worsening between 1979 and 2007 after-tax income increased 275 for the wealthiest 1 of households it rose 65 for the top fifth the bottom fifth only increased by 18 thats true even adding all income from social security welfare and other government paymentsduring this time the wealthiest 1 increased their share of total income by 10 everyone else saw their share shrink by 12 as a result economic mobility worsenedthe 2008 financial crisis saw the rich get richer in 2012 the top 10 of earners took home 50 of all income amadeo 2019
powers fischman and berliner 2016 have highlighted how research on poverty and social inequalities is poorly understood or operationalized which further underpins weak policy responses to entrenched and systemic problemssimilarly it is helpful to problematize how wealth has been accrued historically through genocide slavery imperialism war and conflict colonialism and a host of racialized sexist and other machinations in addition to pikettys 2017 well-documented treatise capital in the twenty-first century mclaren see pruyn and malott 2016 has highlighted marxs theory on surplus value and the limited mobility between the social classes and the crushing blow of capital against labor ultimately the value of what is produced encounters hyper-inflation in the hands of investors owners and speculators without real production which may seem locked into the days of children being exploited in coal mines over a century ago but there are still many parallels today giroux 2016 has coined casino capitalism to label the politico-economic system that enraptures the vast majority of formal and to varying degrees informal activity that underpin mass exploitation he further elucidates the danger of continuing on the one-way neoliberal path before us
neoliberalism has put an enormous effort into creating a commanding cultural apparatus and public pedagogy in which individuals can only view themselves as consumers embrace freedom as the right to participate in the market and supplant issues of social responsibility for an unchecked embrace of individualism and the belief that all social relation be judged according to how they further ones individual needs and self-interests matters of mutual caring respect and compassion for the other have given way to the limiting orbits of privatization and unrestrained self-interest just as it is has become increasingly difficult to translate private troubles into larger social economic and political considerations one consequence is that it has become more difficult for people to debate and question neoliberal hegemony and the widespread misery it produces for young people the poor middle class workers and other segments of society now considered disposable under neoliberal regimes which are governed by a survival-of-the fittest ethos largely imposed by the ruling economic and political elite giroux 2016
mclaren see pruyn and malott 2016 and giroux see giroux sandin and burdick 2018 have also made a compelling case to interpret todays reality as a politico-economic context that is launching us into hyper-sophisticated forms of fascism within this backdrop i believe that there is a great need as there always has been to be more fully engaged with and in education in political circles and in public debate in general in relation to the philosophy and operationalization of capitalism and in particular to the all-encompassing mercantilization of all public and private goods services and experiences enveloped within neoliberalism the covid-19 context has expedited and underscored the slippery slope toward authoritarianism stripping away rights while creating socio-economic cleavages that are even more serious than before giroux 2020democracy 20 is tethered to democracy 10 conceptualizations of the world but the door is slightly open to develop a new world despite the titanic hegemonic vice-grip that maintains a stranglehold on education and public debate as alluded to in the previous section the collective we are free to surf the web consume create diffuse comment and cajole the other whether the other knows us sees us or cares about us or not we are not frontally impeded from opening our eyes and ears on the contrary many movements have been stimulated from doing soincluding the arab spring although the aftermath re-captured regressive hegemonic features of what preceded it the dilemma is that the corporatebusiness politico-economic hegemonic world has grown into this concurrently in-your-face and stealth quickly-evolving dynamic context seamlessly stamping its imprint in every way possible the interplay between democracy 10 and democracy 20 thus offers tremendous potential for citizen participation and engagement while simultaneously presenting the quicksand mirage that we may not be as free as we think we are or we may not be as engaged as we think that we are neoliberalism has many people around the world gasping for airnow mired in a pandemic that vacillates from signs of encouragement that the curve is flattening to fears that community transmission is rapidly spreading through asymptomatic contact there is enormous stress about when there will be an effective vaccination how the health context will play out and increasingly when will the economy get back to normal at this point in timealthough we are aware of massive numbers the information is not hidden anyway of unnecessary deaths in developing countries related to hunger disease poverty and conflict we can see the extreme concern within local national and international governments and institutions to get the economy working while most of the world has emphasized social distancing as a key measure to diminish the dissemination and transmission of covid-19 an eerily bizarre phenomenon has taken hold in the usa wong vaughan quilty-harper and liverpool 2020 disparate semi-organized protests against self-isolation are taking place in diverse locations often replete with a range of arms and placards enunciating the right to among other things haircuts and to play golf is it pure insanity a case of hubris beyond all limits an anti-science ideology that needs to play out in every sectorincluding the environmentor complete indifference to human suffering while the usa situation deeply underscores the anxiety and agitation around the healtheconomy dichotomy i present below a brief illustration of the neoliberalization of the political and economic convergence through an example of the coronavirus in qubec canadaqubec a predominantly french-speaking province of 85 million people in canada provides an interesting illustration of how a jurisdiction within a federal framework has worked to mobilize sensitize and activate a range of health economic political and education measures to confront covid-19 there are daily press briefings information sessions directives a vast media campaign testimonies and a host of consultations which all serve to educate the public and to engage the citizenry concurrently it would be disingenuous to simply criticize where there have been gaps and problems the reality is that many people have worked diligently and courageously to create a sense of the gravity of the problem and to diminish the extent of the propagation of the virus having a universal healthcare system has been i believe indispensable to understanding how to assess allocate distribute and organize resources this is not an individual problem but a vast insidious collective one it should be acknowledged as well that what we know is shifting and re-calibrating in real time and decisions made on march 1 were questioned and re-assessed by march 7 and so on moreover what we know now cannot always be fully understood until later and decisions that are taken in that light can lead to nefarious situations and the rampant spread of the virus hindsight is 2020 as the proverb goes so a fulsome diagnosis of what we are doing today will be more effectively critiqued once we are through to the other side of the pandemicthe situation in qubec one that is surely not unknown elsewhere underscores the fragility of normative democracy this is i believe a question of normative democracy working the way that it does one heart-wrenching issue that we are observing at this time is that the vast majority of deaths in qubec like elsewhere is among those 70 years of age and older and particularly the 80  age-group moreover what many of us did not know or fully consider the vast majority of deaths up until now within qubec are among those who are in long-term care residences in french they are called cshlds roughly 70 which are essentially seniors residences for people with health issues the transmission within these residences is extensive and rapid with an increasing number of personnel nurses and doctors also being affectedone residence for example experienced an overwhelming amount of infection herron discussed below and there are others that have also been deeply affected one might say that there are two public health crises at this time one for the general population and another for these particular residences with this specific group on the one hand the population is astonished sickened and in shock how could this happen especially to our elderly on the other hand this was a serious politico-economic cocktail being mixed for a couple of decades massaged through diverse political parties within the normative democracy that adjudicates such matters why was there such sustained neglect and under-funding why was this not flagged as a serious catastrophe in the making i would like to underscore that this is not a problem of one person one political party one decision one law or one particular model it is the consequence of systemic institutional failurenegligence as well as the thinnest wedges of normative democracy carrying the day over the broader public interest and goodi briefly present some of the specific underlying conditions that lay the groundwork for what is playing out within this vulnerable population at this time a lack of monitoring under-paying workers and diminished policy importance and planning media accounts provide information on the tragedy unfolding before our eyes in one case at herron in western montral the chsld there which is privately owned experienced serious staffing shortages insufficient equipment poor oversight inadequate support from oversight bodies and unacceptable communications with health authorities mckenna 2020 provides a sense of the chaos and suffering there
nurses were getting sick too six out of the seven registered nurses on staff were experiencing covid symptoms and of seven licensed practical nurses lpns only four were still healthy about a quarter of the orderlies prposs aux bnficiares or patient attendants had also stopped working  either because they were experiencing covid symptoms or because they felt it was no longer safe to work at chsld herron within weeks a quarter of those patient attendants would test positive for covid-19 bedridden residents were lying in sheets stained brown up to their necks in excrement so long had it been since their diapers had been changed some were dehydrated and unfed the head of professional services at the ciusss dr nadine larente is the doctor who went to help she told the french-language newspaper la presse the place was in chaos one lpn and two patient attendants were trying to care for 130 residents food trays had been placed on the floor dishes untouched because residents with mobility issues could not reach them mckenna 2020
about double the number proportionately of seniors in qubec opt for long-term care residences compared with the rest of the country which could be a function of culture policy economics and options available and the rapidly aging qubcois population is a further aggravating factor preparing the context dougherty 2020 one expert see lowrie 2020 noted that the spatial configuration with long corridors and residents sharing rooms have a harder time isolating sick residents from uninfected ones compared to residences with house-style layouts where residents live in smaller wings is another factor that helps explain the extreme transmission of the virus in chslds with staff falling ill or refusing to come to work there has been a massive campaign to recruit retired nurses and also to bring doctors and specialists into the overburdened long-term care system the premier of the province has also asked for the military over a thousand troops to further provide support within these seniors residencessocial class and political power are fully intertwined in the quickly unraveling situation involving seniors residences in qubec raising the minimum wage in qubec for example was vigorously opposed by the present government and others along the way fearful that employers especially small businesses could not afford it while there is no maximum wage being regulated those struggling with the minimum wage are often obligated to work two or three jobs to seek assistance elsewhere and face other severe challenges including in relation to housing childcare education and the cost of living the chsld situation brought everything to a head with it being clearly obvious that those designated as essential services were often those being paid the least in society the premier took the almost unprecedented measure of apologizing for underpaying workers when it became difficult and problematic to staff these residences
i know a lot of quebecers are asking themselves how we could have got ourselves in this situation a sombre legault said at his friday briefing addressing the catastrophe unfolding in covid-19-stricken long-term seniors residences chsldsi myself have spent several days and nights asking what i should have done differentlyif i was able to redo one thing i would have increased the wages of orderlies faster even without the accord of the unions i assume full responsibility we entered this crisis ill equipped and clearly the situation deteriorated for all kinds of reasons the virus got in authier 2020
the premier also took a series of steps to increase pay for healthcare workers
as part of its effort to improve working conditions in the health-care system quebec announced that nearly 300000 employees in both the public and private sector will be getting temporary pay increasesworkers who are in direct contact with the disease  such emergency-room professionals and nurses in coronavirus testing centres  will receive an 8  boost in their salariesthose working in long-term care homes known as chslds will also be among the 69000 workers to benefit from the 8  raiseanother 200000 people who work in the health-care system but arent as directly exposed to the disease such as the nurses who staff the 811 health line will get a salary increase of 4 and workers in private long-term care homes many of whom make little more than minimum wage will get an additional 4 per hour that measure appears designed to discourage these workers from quitting and staying home to take advantage of federal financial assistance thats worth 2000 a month shingler stevenson and montpetit 2020
one question that arises here is how these workers could have been underpaid for so long and what the effect may have been for them the people receiving the care the healthcare institutions and system and society as a whole did it dissuade qualified workers from pursuing careers or staying in them what were the other priorities that negated remunerating fairly such indispensable and essential workerson the economic side of the ledger how efficient is it to underpay some employees and over-compensate others who have not actually done the work or who are ironically considered to be disproportionately fundamental is a 101 ratio for salaries at the top and the bottom reasonable or should it be 1001 or 10001 in canada in general the wage differentials are less extreme and odious than the usa but the issue of social inequality is also a significant concern there one study mishe and wolfe 2019 focused on usa compensation provides some backdrop to how public services and priorities can be disproportionately affected
ceo compensation is very high relative to typical worker compensation by a ratio of 278-to-1 or 221-to-1 in contrast the ceo-to-typical-worker compensation ratio options realized was 20-to-1 in 1965 and 58-to-1 in 1989 ceos are even making a lot moreabout five times as muchas other earners in the top 01 from 1978 to 2018 ceo compensation grew by 10075 9403 under the options-realized measure far outstripping sp stock market growth 7067 and the wage growth of very high earners 3392 in contrast wages for the typical worker grew by just 119
there is a lot of complexity to how covid-19 is analyzed and comparing diverse sitesjurisdictionssystems and how data are compiled and evaluated may not reveal the true breadth and scope of the reality similarly there are many moving parts and lots of people remunerated and volunteer involved and engaged and there are also all kinds of activities aimed at supporting a solidified vigorous response my intention in presenting this case study is not to admonish or diminish those serious and important efforts on the contrary it is my hope that this pandemic will reveal a silver lining somewhere in that extreme vulnerabilities and shortcomings need to be rectified in order to ensure as much as possible that economics will not suffocate political considerations in the future and i have not emphasized here the race gender and other pivotal underlying factors underpinning this pandemic but they are also a significant piece of the puzzlethis text has underscored what democracy we are trying to achieve to cultivate and to ingratiate the focus and direction of my central arguments about the lack of bone fide democracy within a normative mainstream political framework that preaches that we live in a developed democracy has i believe become accelerated and accentuated as a result of covid-19 i have highlighted some of the fundamental issues and problems with normative representative hegemonic electoral democracy and also emphasized the pivotal contextual shifts and cornerstones embedded in democracy 10 as well as democracy 20 i have also made the case for more robust critically-engaged citizen participation which would require or at the very least benefit from new forms of education and mediapolitical literacy the social media equation was brought to light since it serves as an unruly uncontrolled and rapidly evolving microcosm of the world its diversity its problems its challenges and its potential i was careful to not make a definitive declaration related to achieving democracy through the potentially transformative technologies that now shape how we live and function and relate to the world despite everything we are still mired in conflicts in inequitable power relations and in democracies that are not very democraticwe are still straddling democracy 10 in which formal political declarations are fabricated with partisan political interests at the fore the stock market is seemingly central to everything and business elites are catered to at every level similarly tax cutsregardless of political stripefigure into everything political parties shamelessly line up to receive donations does anyone believe that they come with no strings attached tax breaks for companies must be considered as much as lower tax rates for the rich does anyone believe that rich people will create more employment based on having more cash if so why are there so many off-shore accounts in tax-havens intended to not pay tax and military might is still right for many the further the coronavirus expands the more there is discussion about needing an economic balance to get back to normal and indicators such as the stock market are central to supposedly gaging what is happening karabell 2020of course there have been lots of incremental changes and lots of new laws policies practices and shifts in cultural norms that have benefitted generally speaking women racialized minorities the poor and the vulnerable yet social inequalities despite massive technological and others changes not only persist but in many regards are increasing how could this be when there is so much wealth why do so many people leave their countries in complete desperation why is there still so much military conflictmost of which goes unreportedwhy do so many problems of poverty and discrimination persist in the most vulgarly palpable ways why is there such little global outrage over the state and fate of indigenous peoples the loss of land language culture and autonomy and why is the environment not the priority this very partial list of questions is noteworthy because neoliberalism is definitely an accelerator to many of the problems we are facing giroux 2020 to be clear here this is not a binary proposition and avoiding confronting real problems with real people will not address real suffering oppression and marginalization gray and gest 2018we might ask why are there recurrent entrenched problems when there are so many people projects forces and movements fighting for a more decent robust and even alternative democracy 20 one that could place neoliberalism within a new different and alternative landscape how should hegemony be understood today when many people so freely believe that they have complete agency over their actions thoughts and experiences and when many people believe that voting is the only key i would stress here that the binary capitalist-socialist rich-poor binary is not the most productive lens through which to examine the complexity of such extreme power imbalances around the world the debate around democracy i believe needs to be more all-encompassing involving all of the tentacles and blockages of neoliberalism into the class race gender cultural and other pivotal sociological markers of identity and it also needs to carve out a place for how power works is distributed and re-created this debate needs to leave open the door for unknown questions and answers as well as creative and alternative processes and deliberations accepting that the normative elections in place are most likely not very beneficial for most people and most definitely the massive numbers of people who do not participate willingly or unwillingly van reybrouck 2017it is important to connect the local with the global as we can through covid-19 ely yamin 2020 provides a sense of the need to address global issues globally and to be leery of not considering the complexity of the linkages between complex problems
but that and many other challenges requires weaving human rights praxishuman rights for social changeinto broader social movements as well as working across disciplinary silos the problems facing the rights movement are too complex for any one set of advocacy tools or any one fields expertise of course there is no single monolithic human rights community just as there is no unified health and human rights community those tropes are used from the inside to police the boundaries of orthodoxy and from the outside to caricaturize sets of actors and strategies yet there are dangers of circling the wagons defensively around our professional tribes the complexity of the challenges posed by rampant inequality the spread of authoritarianism and illiberalism distrust in multilateralism and climate cataclysm call for embracing justified critiques and opening up to new ideas and perspectivesand uniting with labor environmental and many other social justice movements ely yamin 2020
inspired by paulo freires transformative work freire 1970 i would advocate for more openness and acceptance of political realities that shape our lived experiences as well as an extremely healthy dose of humility as means to being able to understand engage with and be with the other i explore more fully the interconnections and inspiration of freires work with my colleague gina thse carr and thse 2019 the hard-wired testosterone-induced keep-fundraising-at-all-times political systems that have been put in place all over the place need to be re-imagined before they suffocate themselves and everyone else people will slowly divest themselves from the voting game leaving it as an empty shell filled with a bunch of white guys in suites yes there are some openings for other identities in this equation but the game was made by and for these guys freire wrote of conscientization and i believe that to get there we need to focus on peace not war social and cultural development as opposed to economic development solidarity and emancipation rather than exclusively on individual rights and liberties and the recognition that we are all human beings as human beings we are not required to be racist no baby is racist but we learn to be so sexist a totally learned behavior classist exploiting ones neighbor is not an obligation kill one another who gets killed anyway the rich or the poor and who are they do we care or live with so much misery hatred and oppression ultimately we are in the same boat or world togetherone could see the glass half full with lots of progress all over the place and yet the empty side of the glass contains real people living through unimaginable for the full side of the glass realities the wage discrepancies and gaps in the qubec example exemplify this reality the quest for a meaningful democracy aimed at both sides of the glass would be a more conducive option and re-imagining democracy will require more fully and even disproportionately considering the empty side of the glass taking a stand against democracy 10 and normative representative hegemonic electoral democracy is a necessary condition to moving forward for this re-imagined democracydonkervoort 2020 underscores that the pandemic has been exploited by autocrats but that citizens can resist and coalesce around global initiatives to weaken and confront hegemonic forces this could mean enhanced civil society engagement across all boundaries with an eye to unmasking and dismantling the concentration of wealth and power covid-19 has exposed the need for a different universe not only in terms of public health but also importantly in relation to democracy and citizen engagement roy 2020 so while my foot to return to the title may be in taters im hopefulindeed it may be the only way out if thisthat my head will not be the ultimate causality as we strive to either sustain or re-imagine a democracy that can not only take us out of a pandemic but rather into social solidarity that will remove our bodies and minds and souls from imminent disasteracute respiratory tract infections artis are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality and a common reason for both outpatient visits and hospitalisations among humans worldwide rna viruses the agents that cause arti most frequentlyusually a self-limiting upper respiratory tract syndrome coronaviruses covs are recombining enveloped viruses with long positive-sense rna genomes they are ancestrally zoonotic in origin having adapted to bind a diverse range of cellular receptors 1 four human coronaviruses hcovs have evolved initially from bats camelids and rodents to become distinct global endemic seasonal pathogens causing mild to moderate arti among humans 23the hcovs occupy two of four genera in the subfamily coronavirinae 4 human coronavirus 229e and betacoronavirus-1 subspecies hcov-oc43 have been known for more than 50 years while human coronavirus nl63 and human coronavirus hku1 were first characterised in 2004 and 2005 respectivelya severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-cov briefly emerged into the human population during 20022004 but was controlled and is not known to circulate today its brief but severe emergence sparked renewed study of covs in 2012 another novel severely pathogenic cov was identified in the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa 80 of over 2000 human cases have been recorded over five years 5 both sars-cov and the new middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov belonging to the species middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus evolved from ancestral but different bat covs travel history and laboratory analysis would be required to differentiate mers from sars if it still occurred 6 to date most mers cases have been limited to countries in the arabian peninsula with rare travel-related spillovers one case precipitated a large healthcare multi-facility outbreak in the republic of korea in 2015a confirmed case of mers occurs when a person irrespective of signs or symptoms has a laboratory-reported mers-cov infection a probable case requires a minimum of a clinically diagnosed acute febrile disease an epidemiologic link and a partial laboratory diagnostic profile 7we briefly review recent literature and the current understanding of mers and mers-cov highlighting some knowledge gapsthe viral receptor for mers-cov is a transmembrane glycoprotein called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp-4 which has a wide tissue distribution in humans including on alveolar cells of the lower respiratory tract and in the small intestine 89 dpp-4 interacts with the mers-cov at its receptor-binding domain rbd within the spike fusion protein figure 1 dpp-4 expression is upregulated in the lower respiratory tract of those with poor lung function in the lower respiratory tract of those with untreated asthma and in soluble form in the plasma of obese patients 8101112 whether blood borne dpp-4 interferes with mers-cov or through reversible binding contributes to its systemic distribution of mers-cov during serious disease are questions worthy of further investigation studies of the upper respiratory tract have found little to no sign of dpp-4 expression levels or tissue distribution although one study identified dpp-4 enzymatic activity suggesting it is present 101314 it may be useful to expand the search for dpp-4 expression to tissues indicated by cases with different disease states co-infections especially with viruses known to inflame the lower respiratory tract and trigger asthma exacerbations such as rhinoviruses are also of interest mers-cov may also use sialic acids as a low-affinity but selective cellular receptor to aid attachment and entry into dpp-4 positive cells 15mers is most well characterised as a respiratory disease of humans extensive inflammation and immune evasion are hallmarks of severe disease ascribed to covs 1617 among confirmed mers cases fever cough and dyspnoea are the most common clinical manifestations 1819 the mean incubation period for mers is between 2 and 13 days longer periods are associated with a reduced risk of death 202122 mers-cov infection also results in mild and subclinical outcomesthe typical mers case is a saudi male aged between 21 and 60 years often presenting to a hospital with pneumonia or worse 182324 severe mers occurs most frequently among those with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus cirrhosis and others affecting respiratory renal and cardiac systems 232526 downregulation of innate immune response mediators associated with some of these disorders may be related to the severity of mers 27 it may be that the high frequency of severe mers reflects elevated prevalence of certain comorbidities in the middle east region 27 comorbidities did not feature among sars cases as they have among cases of mers mers-cov is a highly opportunistic pathogenin june 2015 an outbreak in the republic of korea found confirmed cases presented with fever cough and upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms progressing within a week to lower respiratory tract distress with lymphopenia and elevated liver enzymes 23242728 mers can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan system failure requiring intensive supportive care 232429 extra pulmonary infection does occur likely resulting from haematogenous transport of virus which is an area in need of further study 930 similarly little is known about sequelae following mers-cov infection in one study those who survived acute respiratory distress syndrome were well one year later 19 another study identified delayed neurological manifestations during treatment of mers cases but lacked long-term follow-up 31death occurs among 3040 of mers cases approximately 40 of cases in the ksa and 20 of cases in the republic of korea where mortality ranged from 7 among younger age groups to 40 among those aged 60 years and above among studies of fatal cases death occurred between 515 days after symptom onset 18213233 because the extent of subclinical or mild infections in the community remains unquantified mortality figures may be overestimates 34mers-cov variants exist as a single antigenic group in lineage c of the genus betacoronavirus 3536 when mers-cov infection is subclinical or less severe humoral immune responses may be weak delayed short-lived or undetectable 3738394041 humans can still be reinfected if they have pre-existing neutralising antibodies similarly to what is seen in camels 41 however survivors of symptomatic mers do develop antibodies including neutralising antibodies which decline but persist for 13 years 3742 whether these antibodies prevent future infection remains to be examined those with mild or subclinical mers still develop cd8 t-cell responses and survivors of more severe mers including those who do not mount an antibody response develop both cd8 and cd4 t-cell responses 43robust laboratory-based real-time rt-pcr diagnostic tools were described immediately after mers-cov was discovered and remain reliable 44 several different research-based antibody detection protocols have also been reported for human and animal studies 45 molecular and serological kits are commercially available 46 while current molecular methods are rapid there are many steps that combine to delay publication of a final test result from the initial decision to request a mers-cov test to sample collection nucleic acid extraction pcr additional sampling repeat testing and reporting processes molecular rapid and sensitive point-of-care tests pocts are not available but would help support infection control in healthcare settingsthe world health organisation recommends testing of appropriate samples for mers-cov rna using real-time rt-pcr methods with subgenomic sequencing to confirm screening results as necessary 47 repeat testing is often required 1748 virus isolation by culture is not a recommended tool detecting antibodies against mers-cov may be useful to identify a seroconversion that can define a probable case when confirmation by rt-pcr has been unsuccessful or impossible 47mild and subclinical mers cases are reported among younger people including healthcare workers and children 174950 it remains unclear what proportion of mers-cov infections are truly subclinical after one study found many were initially incorrectly classified 51 difficulty identifying a useful diagnostic antibody response in mild and subclinical disease means seroprevalence studies likely under-report the history of mers-cov 40 mers-cov specific cd8 testing may be helpful 43 the usefulness of serology needs clarificationhumans are incidental hosts of mers-cov the principal natural reservoir host of mers-cov is the dromedary camel 16 among camels mers-cov infection manifests in a manner similar to that in which the common cold manifests in humans the camel upper respiratory tract expresses high levels of the dpp-4 receptor 13 the study of mers-cov highlights the need for collaboration between politics and diverse basic and applied fields of research at the humananimal interfacea one health approach camel trade plays a central role in the movement of infected hosts around the arabian peninsula pakistan and north west and east africa all harbour mers-cov-infected camels 52535455 alpacas llamas and pigs are potential hosts according to experimental evidence 565758 in addition alpacas have been found to be naturally infected 59the virus genetically detected or biologically cultured from humans is nearly identical to that isolated from camels and in some instances has been used to identify transmission routes signs of virus change have appeared with continued surveillance over time recombination has been identified and variation in the region of the tropism-defining spike protein in a divergent egyptian camel mers-cov variant 60 has been associated with reduced infectivity in vitro compared to human and less divergent camel mers-cov variants 61 nearly 300 human and animal mers-cov genome sequences have been produced from mers-cov infections since 2012 but few studies of the functional impact of identified mutations have been conducted among mers-related coronaviruses 62 there may now exist three conspecific viruses the camel mers-cov and the bat covs btvs-betacovsc2013 63 and predictpdf-2180 64 each with related but distinct genomes and divergent spike genes ongoing viral surveillance and characterisation is essential to ensure variants with increased efficiency in attachment fusion or replication do not emerge unnoticed surveillance of human respiratory illness in mers-cov-positive camel countries outside of the arabian peninsula is currently lacking 52according to the ksa ministry of health 65 nearly half of all mers cases are classified as primary cases zoonoses originating from direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels or from an unidentified source which had no link to any other known human case the precise mechanism by which mers-cov spreads from camels to humans is unknown but is not essential for enacting precautions to reduce exposure to infected animals secondary cases make up slightly more than half of all mers cases mostly resulting from exposure associated with a healthcare facilityinfectious mers-cov is presumed to be found in droplets 59 but modelling has also suggested the possibility of airborne spread 45 virus remains viable for at least 48 h on plastic and steel surfaces presumably underpinning the extensive contamination of air and surfaces in hospitals housing patients with mers 666768697071 the virus appears sensitive to standard heat and chemical inactivation measures 7273antibodies to mers-cov have been found in camel sera as far back as 1983 in each animal antibodies to mers-cov are short-lived and do not prevent reinfection 527475human contact with camels is often associated with the collection preparation and ingestion of camel milk or meat female camels especially those bred for milking have the highest rates of mers-cov seropositivity mers-cov rna has been detected in milk from one study and virus was found to be stable after being spiked into milk samples from another study 537677 camels in larger herds have higher rates of seropositivity compared with smaller herds 5253 female and young camels also have higher rates of mers-cov rna than older and male camels 53 while no evidence for human infection resulting from ingestion has been presented it has been found that experimentally inoculated human intestinal cells and organoids can host productive mers-cov infection and that mers-cov can remain infectious after transit through gastric acids 9 further intestinal respiratory and neurological infection follows intragastric inoculation of dpp-4 transgenic mice 9 whether camel milk and meat actually contain a suitable infectious dose to cause intestinal infection of humans is yet to be determined 78 it seems likely that the processes of milking and butchery may contaminate surfaces and generate infectious droplets that include sufficient inoculum from which a human infection could result via inhalation or self-inoculation it is not known whether the eyes act as a portal for mers-cov entrysince the majority of human-to-human mers-cov infections are associated with healthcare improved infection control and prevention is considered key for preventing outbreaks among humans not at occupational risk of exposure to infected animals 79 in the outbreak in the republic of korea 5 of 186 cases were responsible for 83 of transmission events most new cases did not result in any identified onward transmission the reproduction r0 number was calculated as 39 and 1969 from selected ksa outbreaks 80 three of these five cases were coughing prolonged exposures crowding and large numbers of contacts were important factors for disproportionate virus transmission 818283the role if any for mild or subclinical mers-cov infections in maintaining the virus in the human population has not been convincingly addressed a healthcare worker found to shed viral rna for more than five weeks in the absence of disease adds urgency to the need for such studies 84 none among 82 contacts of a mildly symptomatic mers-cov-infected healthcare worker seroconverted but there was no mention of whether the index case seroconverted 85 in a ksa hospital outbreak investigation contacts of subclinical mers-cov-infected healthcare workers became rt-pcr positive suggesting transmission was a possibility 17 some studies report very rare camel contact among human cases and no history of contact with other mers-cov-infected humans and this raises the question of how these primary cases acquire infection 18 community spread and subclinical transmission need more attentionthe hajj pilgrimage an annual mass gathering in the ksa provides many opportunities for mers-cov to transmit and then spread globally however it is rhinoviruses influenza viruses and other seasonal respiratory viruses that have to date driven the bulk of respiratory disease associated with the hajj this indirectly reinforces that mers-cov does not transmit efficiently among humans outdoors 86 in hospital environments healthcare workers and other patients and carers who experience prolonged exposure to infectious cases in the absence of suitable personal protective equipment ppe are those who usually become infected there have been examples of the 2080 rule whereby relatively few infected individuals are responsible for a disproportionate number of new cases 83 insufficient cleaning of room surfaces inadequate room ventilation and overcrowding have also been suggested to drive indoor mers-cov transmissionno specific antiviral or licensed vaccine is available for a cov that infects humans but a range of candidates exist even if mers-cov infection is rare transmits poorly and does not evolve to become a pandemic threat it serves in a useful role to drive vaccine research of other covs both current and yet to emerge for cases in healthcare facilities improving hand hygiene the use of ppe gloves gown respiratory and eye protection 87 and surface cleaning can help disrupt transmission as can rapid triage of febrile patients with respiratory signs and symptoms to prevent mers-cov infection from dromedary camels precautions include avoiding contact with camel nasal secretions cooking camel meat and pasteurising camel milk until further studies better quantify the risk attached to each of these potential pathwaysvaccines to prevent cov disease require both humoral and cellular immunity 88 because airway immune responses may be key to preventing the establishment of human mers-cov infection localised deposition of an aerosolised vaccine could prove useful 88 a number of vaccine platforms and payloads have proceeded although progress has been challenged by the need for animal models that suitably reconstitute human lower respiratory tract disease to show evidence of any preventative effect 8990 some candidates have progressed to clinical trials 9192 the spike protein and rbd elicit neutralising antibody responses and have been employed as the payload for a number of platforms 889394 including dna vaccines 95 modified vaccinia virus ankara 9697 measles virus 979899100 and human- 26101 and chimpanzee-adenovirus-based vectors 99 there are also venezuelan equine encephalitis replicons expressing nucleocapsid 101 nanoparticles 102 and structural and non-structural deletion mutants of mers-cov 103vaccination of camels is likely to be the most rapid least expensive and best intervention for preventing rare spillovers that then become amplified by humans in healthcare settings successes have been reported but the approach is challenged by the problem that camels are naturally reinfectable with mers-cov even in the presence of a high titre of neutralising antibodies 5274104 to date camel vaccines reduce viral load but do not prevent virus shedding 104105 human vaccines could target the occupational at-risk groups which include healthcare farm barn market and slaughterhouse workers 5688106 more widespread application of a mers vaccine at this time does not seem warrantedthe rarity of seropositive donors sometimes low antibody titres and a lack of clinical evidence have made the use of convalescent sera from recovering mers patients a possibility for treatment but one with significant limitations 39 instead human monoclonal antibodies targeting the rbd and polyclonal antibodies may provide treatment options for those at risk of severe outcomes 107108109110 clinical trials are awaitedearly control of viral replication is important and administration of interferon ifn 1b or a ribavirin and ifn 2b combination within hours initially showed promise their practical use in humans is challenging because if not infected while in a healthcare setting humans usually present for care with well advanced disease 111112 combined treatments which reduce viral replication and the host immune response to it are likely to be valuable developments 16a wide range of repurposed or novel potential antivirals including polymerase nucleotide synthesis and protease inhibitors and fusion-inhibiting peptides 6691113114115116117 have been investigated 91115 corticosteroid use is not recommended for acute respiratory distress syndrome 113 comparative studies and randomised controlled trials are mostly lacking 91though much is already known it remains important to clarify the routes of human infection including the role of the eyes in contracting infection among primary human cases the development of rapid molecular poct tests and alternatives to serology such as cd8 detection can help us understand mers-cov transmission which can lead to reductions in outbreaks the scale of mild and subclinical cases among non-hospitalised arabian peninsula communities is unknown as is their role in transmission most knowledge of mers comes from studies of hospital-based populations or linked community contacts future prospective long-term cohort studies of mild community respiratory illnesses using molecular methods would be useful children have so far been largely absent from the mers case tally but they may represent an important population for prospective study recent lessons from the zika and ebola viruses should also inform new studies seeking possible long-term sequelae and viral persistence and highlight the need to follow-up severe mers patientsin september 2017 mers-cov passed its fifth year since discovery it remains a rare cause of disease in a geographically defined region of the world known for the concurrent presence of infected camel hosts much of what we know about mers relates to severe disease travel-related cases continue to challenge the rest of the worlds surveillance and response capabilities and we need more data to understand unexplained primary transmission signs of genetic change in mers-cov have been recorded but it remains unclear whether they change clinical disease how camels came to carry the virus they live with today remains unknown but it is academic for the control of mers to date human-to-human transmission has been inefficient but virus surveillance and characterisation will ensure any change to the status quo is identified mers-cov is not currently a pandemic threat it is spread with the aid of human habit and error nevertheless a much needed therapeutic toolbox is being developed and in this process we are learning more about how covs cause disease how they confound our immune responses where they come from and how to prevent and treat their respiratory infections 90 focused research is needed to minimise the impact of mers basing control strategies on evidence gleaned from specifically addressing relevant unknownsthe broadcast and print media have a very big influence on public opinion and they are major channels for communication between decision makers and the public the power of the media stems from its influence on the crystallization of our thoughts thoughts serve like an engine which drives and controls our actions and behaviour the media have the ability to work day and night for the purpose of forming perceptions manipulations and changing convictions regardless of whether it is a positive or negative change acceptable or rejected beneficial or harmful beloved or hatedthe media play a crucial role in revolutions especially arab spring uprisings the war on terror and international security the media depend on conveying or transmitting news and creating a dialogue between governments and people and between different parties in a certain country or society the media have also played a crucial role in political campaigns peace and conflict studies the media therefore are the medium by which people can raise their concerns problems and needs to their governments the media have become a tool of pressure they can easily agitate the public opinion by raising specific as well as sensitive issues they can also agitate people by resorting to manipulation persuasion distortion and deceptionnelson 17 states thatbias is the predisposition for or against a particular point of view whenever the positions or interests of a portion of the audience are overlooked distorted or censored the problem of bias is found bias may result from unintentional or deliberate decisions on the part of media gatekeepers but nevertheless subjects audiences to a skewed reality potentially detrimental to their best interests 2hofstetter and buss 9 illustrate that polemics about the word bias in ordinary language is basically slanted in other words bias presents something such as a news story in a way that favors a particular group or opinion bias interprets or presents someone or something in an ideological way for special interests bias also reports certain issues problems actors politicians and any other political event not as they really are bias is not free from lying distortion of and diffusing certain facts disagreement over basic values beliefs or moresmullainathan and shleifer 15 stress the fact that information can be manipulated by different ways ignoring or omitting information that is opposite to or inconsistent with the message of the news story finding information sources that can reinforce or strengthen the story ignoring neglecting and undermining information sources that are incompatible with the message or using misleading and deceitful language and images that support the storyundoubtedly media bias news bias and manipulation of information cannot be achieved without the language language serves as a powerful tool by which media owners depend on in conveying their ideologies and manipulations 22 kolsto 12 argues that the media are politically controlled this political control has great impact over its response to any kind of crisis or eventpoliticizing pandemics is not a new bad and negative issue which we as humans need to get rid of history proved that pandemics were politicized and used for ideological and political interests dangerous diseases such as the 1918 h1n1 flu aids ebola were politicized 1 6 20 21in fact history does not repeat itself but it teaches us lessons and inspires us to response and act differently to current crises to get positive and good results of our negative previous ones sadly we have not learned a lesson from our previous and disastrous crises instead we stubbornly politicize and invest the current deadly covid-19 pandemic for political and ideological purposes scott 21 emphasizes that disease and responses to disease are always politicized and have always political consequences ebola virus is politicized just like other previous viruses covid-19 is a virus like other previous viruses such as plague 1918 flu asian flu cholera aids sars ebola zika sars and mers it is a virus and this is the law of nature instead of cooperating together to defeat such a deadly disease governments especially those in power are busy exchanging accusations zhao lijian the spokesperson of chinas ministry of foreign affairs accused the united states of america of spreading the pandemic in wuhan the epicenter of covid-19 outbreak 10 16 president trump responded by labeling the virus as chinese virus then his secretary of state mike pompeo called the virus as wuhan virus 14 exchanging accusations between china and us continues the us even asked to open an investigation which links the virus to wuhan labspage 18 emphasizes that politicizing the pandemic is hazardous to national health stigmatizing a nation or country for its supposed responsibility in a calamity does not produce a vaccine or medicine for the virus but rather complicates it when racism stereotypes hate speech and propaganda are combined with intense fear and terror from a disease more problems will definitely emerge the media and means of social communication can make the situation even harder than expected distorted and false information manipulation ideology conspiracy theory undocumented claims and inaccurate conclusions can spread quicker than the virus itself politicizing pandemics and broadcasting fear and hate speech will lead to the discrimination and stigmatization of others in a wrong thoughtless and bad way 6 politicizing diseases shaped and can shape public attitudes about immigration the chinese exclusion act was the first immigration law passed in 1882 due to disease threat and after decades of stereotyping chinese immigrants and believing that chinese carry diseases such as cholera and smallpox the law prevented chinese from immigrating to the united states the scott act of 1888 was introduced to heavily restrict and prevent chinese to immigrate to the us such laws and views hurt an entire community and at the same time they did not stop the spread of diseases the pandemic flu which was first identified in china during the end of 1950s was known as asian flu the other flu pandemic that was appeared in hong kong during the end of 1960s was called hong kong flu the 20092010 h1n1 flu which was first identified in the us was called swine flu media coverage of this flu emphasized that this flu might have come from mexico which again caused fears from immigrants 13politicizing pandemics encourages ethnic and racial discrimination among different people societies and countries it creates political social and even health problems it also pushes people to indulge in hate speech and aggression therefore we should avoid disinformation distortion racial rhetoric slur expressions ideology manipulation and propaganda in other words we should work together to control the disease and overcome it in the end viruses do not know borders and do not distinguish between colors religions and creedsbukhari and xiaoyang 3 elucidate that van dijk put up the analysis of structures at various levels of description ranging from phonological morphological grammatical and semantic levels to higher levels such as coherence themes and topics related to different news stories and other whole schematic and rhetorical dimensions of textsyarlott et al 28 state thatdiscourse structure is a key aspect of all forms of text providing valuable information about the contents of a given span of text this is most obvious in academic legal and technical texts which are often clearly delineated into sections containing for example introductory background or explanatory material among othersthese type of texts are designed to make it easy to find specific information within them quickly news articles have a similarly helpful though implicit design they often provide a brief up-front summary of the important events relevant background information comments from both experts and the reporters and detailed descriptions of the main events events are often not presented in chronological order but rather structured by importance 25drid 7 illustrates van dijks framework for the analysis of the discourse of news depends on two systematic ranks of structures global structures and local structures the global structures consist of two discourse structures namely macrostructures and superstructures the local structures include the microstructureszhang et al 29 state thatvan dijks study of news discourse has his peculiar feature he believes that discourse is a kind of social control power which represents the willpower of authority and reflects special power structure the people who control and spread discourse are news journalists writers artists and scholars these people are called symbolic elites the powerful people are entitled to control all kinds of discourse while common people are only able to control daily conversation the aim of van dijks study is to observe in what ways the powerful people implement express describe or conceal their ambition through context and discourse in particular he pays much attention to the role of ideology he had made amounts of media discourse surveys such as news report tv program and advertisement his purpose is to illustrate how western authorities control the form and content of discourse and further control the belief and ideology of society 200201van dijks 2326 study news as discourse all of these studies give authors useful frameworks news schemata for analyzing any news story or report from any channel or newspaper the three discourse structures namely macrostructures superstructures and microstructures are crucial for the analysis of the selected news reportsthe macrostructure of discourse is thematic in other words macrostructure is the main subject or topic that is being discussed or described and on which the whole story is based on thematic analysis is concerned with the main theme or topic of a certain text topics and themes illustrate and uncover different social as well as psychological proportions of any text or news story 19 26 in news reports or stories the macrostructure is often expressed in the headline and the lead paragraphthe superstructure is schematic it shows the main parts of a news story and the way it is arranged or organized the superstructures of a news story consist of three main parts they are introduction substance and conclusion the news story consists of an introduction represented by the first paragraph of the story a substance content the essence or the main story and a conclusion closing the last part the result or the outcome of a news story 2 26the local structure of discourse is concerned with semantic syntactic stylistic and rhetorical aspects of a given text 2 it focuses on the selected lexical items words and sentences that are used to form a news story according to van dijk 26 a news story is not free from the following different aspects of meaning presuppositions implications inferences concealments euphemisms disclaiming denials blaming the victim negativization and in general the combined strategy of positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation many of these semantic features involve various forms of implicitness or indirectness 177 all of such aspects of meaning within their hidden ideologies cannot be discovered without the help of the microstructure of discourse fig 1van dijks 26 lists important questions that should be answered during the analysis of any text especially if the analysed text is a news storyhow is the topical information organized in the textwhat tends to be given prominence what information is presented first and what information lastwhich news schema categories are emphasized and whycoronaviruses are a family of viruses that are found in animals and humans certain types cause illnesses in people some coronaviruses cause the common cold others cause diseases which are much more severe such as middle east respiratory syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars both of which often lead to pneumonia on 30th january 2020 who declared the outbreak of covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern pheic 4on 31 december 2019 a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in wuhan hubei province china on 9 january 2020 chinas cdc reported a novel coronavirus as the main cause of this outbreak which is phylogenetically in the sars-cov clade the disease associated to it is now known as novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 8most of the patients that are suffering from covid-19 are adults and old the main symptoms of the pandemic are fever dry cough and difficulties shortness in breathing 80 of covid-19 patients suffered from mild illness 14 experienced severe disease and 6 suffered from critical illness illness severity is associated with age over 60 s and other comorbid conditions 8 27illustration of the ultrastructure of the covid-19 virus-cdcscience photo library 11according to johns hopkins university and medicine 5 the pandemic has sickened more than six million and at least 369000 victims have died unfortunately numbers of infection and death are increasingin order to achieve the aim of the study it is important to give a clear description of the data that are used for the analysis the data are 4 news reports about coronavirus taken from two newspapers namely the new york times from the united sates and global times from china two news reports are analysed for each newspaper the study aims to show and prove how the virus has been used politically in the media the news reports are taken from the main websites of the selected news channels and newspapers the approach that is followed for the analysis is van dijks news schemata framework which is presented in detail in section two above the news reports are analysed according to the three main discourse structures namely the macrostructures superstructures and microstructuresin terms of macrostructure the first report of the new york times has the following headline china clamps down on coronavirus coverage as cases surge undoubtedly headlines are crucial in showing the main themes or topics of a news story through the help of headlines one can understand what the stories are talking about starting with the first headline the phrasal verb clamps down means to stop or limit the activity of coronavirus outbreak the word surge means to move very quickly and suddenly in a particular direction one proposition that might emerge from this headline is that china is unable to stop the spread of the outbreak although china clamps down on coronavirus but it is moving and spreading faster another proposition which can be extracted is that chinas efforts to limit or stop the outbreak might not be real or effectivein terms of superstructure the introduction of the first report presents the failure of the communist government to control the pandemic according to new york times the government cannot control the pandemic therefore it puts its efforts on the media to strengthen its propaganda of controlling the disease but the government control of the virus is just a narrative and a lie as the number of coronavirus infections in china continues to surge the communist government has clamped down on the news media and the internet signaling an effort to control the narrative about a crisis that has become a once-in-a-generation challenge for leaders in beijing the substance develops the first paragraph and gives more stories about the failure of the communist government in controlling the spread of the outbreak stories with more contextual details talk about the hundreds victims of the virus thousands of confirmed infections public frustration running across the country due to the governments weaknesses in controlling the pandemic and official media propaganda talks about virus relief efforts the government is presented negatively doing negative and irresponsible acts such as removing a range of articles talking about the shortcomings of the governments slow and weak response to the outbreak and reprimanding people who give factual cases of the illness the report emphasizes the lack of medical supplies and face mask production which are described as running short and in overdrive and shortage of testing kits the report also describes the government as weak relying on media to broadcast propaganda and positive stories on its efforts to contain the virus the conclusion ends with the scientists in china and their efforts to find a drug to stop the outbreakthe microstructure deals with all the semantic syntactic lexical and rhetorical aspects of discourse and in this case a news report in terms of semantics more contextual details are devoted to the communist government and its inability to control the virus the report is full of propaganda fake positive stories regarding the government strength and potential in controlling the virus the number of the dead victims and confirmed cases the government propaganda its restrictions on media social media and freedom of speech are reported in details all of the stories that are related to the restrictions of internet platforms implicate and presuppose a totalitarian system of government in which a single authoritarian party controls state-owned means of production blaming the victim and division and contrast strategies are used clearly through the report the negative others representation is reported clearly through blaming the chinese government of shortcomings and restrictionsin terms of syntax the structure of sentences illustrates the stories of the report clearly and coherently without any vagueness especially when the stories are related to the governments shortcomings in controlling the virus the number of the victims who lost their lives due to the pandemic and the confirmed new cases the new york times uses active voice and simple tenses in order to make events clear and deductive the news stories especially those that are related to the governments weaknesses and shortcomings in controlling the virus are written with complex sentences full of cohesive ties and conjunctions to describe the difficult and complex situation in china as supplies run short face mask production runs in overdrive the rapidly rising number of infections and deaths from the new virus has put renewed pressure on the senior leadership in china hospitals near the center of the epidemic have been overwhelmed and people with flulike symptoms have been turned away many cases have not been diagnosed because of a shortage of testing kitsin terms of lexis all the report is negative and its language is critical criticizing the communist government and its inability to fight the virus negative words that carry strong connotations are used in the report words and phrases such as frustrations rigorously communism crisis fear shortcomings propaganda short shortage overdrive turned away forbidden blocked and gloom are clearly used in the report all of these words are used to negatively refer to the chinese government the prominent image of the chinese government is that of a communist-authoritarian one that uses its own ideologies and propaganda another image is that of deficient government incapable of controlling a virus and providing medical supplies and services to its people the prominent image of the chinese people is associated with frustration a deep chronic sense or state of insecurity and dissatisfaction arising from unsolved problems or unfulfilled needsin terms of rhetoric the phrase communist government has negative connotations it is associated with harshness and totalitarianism all the citizens should be totally subject to an absolute state authority in the report the communist government in china and its propaganda is highly emphasized propaganda is a symbol of manipulation control distortion half-truths or lies it is used to refer to the communist government in china repetition is used through the reports all the negative stories that are related to the shortcomings of the chinese government in controlling the pandemic and in providing medical services and peoples fears and frustrations due to the governments weaknesses are always repeated in the reportin the second headline which is entitled coronavirus weakens chinas powerful propaganda machine the phrase chinas powerful propaganda machine is used to invite the reader to believe in the idea proposition that china is not really powerful and its power is just propaganda in the sense that it is unable to contain as well as overcome an unseen virus a very tiny and unseen virus manages to weaken its power another proposition can be emerged from this headline is that chinas power is just an illusion this illusion is made real by the official chinese mediathe superstructure of a news report looks on how the parts of the report namely the introduction the substance and the conclusion are arranged and which events are emphasized and given prominence the new york times gives more emphasis and prominence to the governments propaganda and totalitarianism the introduction comes under the title beijing is pushing tales of perseverance but many young people are openly questioning the communist partys message according to the new york times the perseverance of beijing is just a tale or fiction not an actual fact people in china do not believe or are frustrated with these fake tales of stability steadfastness and perseverance the substance again and again supports the introduction with different negative stories of failure rigidity and shortcomings the governments failure in controlling the virus is presented clearly in the reports beijing is tapping its old propaganda playbook as it battles the relentless coronavirus outbreak the problem for chinas leaders this time it isnt working so well in the new york times chinese government is always associated with rigidity hardness and severity it is a rigid system towards its people and medical staff it is also powerless unable to provide medical equipment and supplies the government was slow to disclose the threat of the coronavirus and worked to suppress the voices of those who tried to warn the country exhausted medical workers with faces lined from hours of wearing goggles and surgical masks women with shaved heads a gesture of devotion retirees who donate their life savings anonymously in government offices the conclusion ends with ms xia story whose weibo account has been suspended for 30 days for her epidemic-related posts and that she was determined to keep on speaking whatever censorship is the new york times finishes the report with a quotation for ms xia speak up as much as your courage allows she said in the end its better than saying nothingthe microstructure uses semantic syntactic lexical and rhetorical tools to uncover hidden ideologies in news stories in terms of semantics the new york times again gives more contextual details to the governments propaganda that is used through its official media according to the new york times the government has gained nothing against the virus their achievements against the pandemic are just lies the report is full of stories related to the governments powerful propaganda as well as opposite stories related to the shortcomings and harsh-totalitarian treatment of medical staff consider this quotation beijing is tapping its old propaganda playbook as it battles the relentless coronavirus outbreak the biggest challenge to its legitimacy in decades state media is filling smartphones and airwaves with images and tales of unity and sacrifice aimed at uniting the people behind beijings rule it even briefly offered up cartoon mascots named jiangshan jiao and hongqi man characters meant to stir patriotic feelings among the young during the crisis blaming the victim and theme of negative other representation are clearly used in the report even the unity that state media call for is not meant to fight the pandemic but it is meant to unite the people behind beijing rule consider these quotations exhausted medical workers with faces lined from hours of wearing goggles and surgical masks women with shaved heads a gesture of devotion retirees who donate their life savings anonymously in government offices people are also angry about state media accounts of female medical workers who shave their heads although the idea of women shaving their heads has been repeated but the new york times does not mention the reason the purpose behind women shaving their heads remains vague division and contrast strategy also repeated in the report a contrast or comparison between the governments propaganda with its positive tales of unity and strength and the negative role of the government which is represented by its shortcomings and harsh treatment and censorship of people are mentioned repeatedly in the reportin terms of syntax the structures of sentences are simple and clear anyone can understand the stories of the report especially those related to chinese propaganda negative and bad treatment of medical staff and women shortcomings of the government in controlling the outbreak and providing enough medical supplies all the basic elements of a good narrative are found in the report the report has orientation characterization and complication if we cant become a whistle-blower like li wenliang then lets be a person who can hear the whistle blowing yan lianke a novelist said in a lecture at hong kong university of science and technology in february the hot news sense of the perfect used in the new york times is remarkable the new york times uses perfect tense when it talks about sorrowful stories chinas propaganda spinners have some tough competition chinese people have seen images of a young woman crying mom mom as her mothers body was driven away theyve seen a woman banging a homemade gong from her balcony while begging for a hospital bed theyve seen an exhausted nurse breaking down and howling and they have all seen the face of li wenliang the doctor who tried to warn china about the very virus that killed him agency is used clearly in the report the new york times uses agency to highlight responsibility the government was slow to disclose the threat of the coronavirus and worked to suppress the voices of those who tried to warn the country beijing has intensified internet censorship in the past few weeksin terms of lexis the negative discourse or the image of negative other representation is clearly used in the report negative stories of the governments shortcomings in controlling the virus and in providing medical supplies and bad treatment of medical staff monitoring people suspending and deleting social accounts and posts that talk and provide information about the spread of the outbreak are clearly used in all the report the whole report is negative the new york times uses many negative words and phrases such as exhausted devotion problem criticizing harshly condemned lack scorn pressured funeral propaganda biggest challenges suppress young woman crying breaking down howling authoritarian government silencing faade of omnipotent government blatantly unbelievable angry confused people did not cheer intensified deleted suspended and tighter limits the prominent image of the chinese government is that of a totalitarian government with its people and medical staff another image of the chinese government is that it is always associated with shortage failure and deficiency the image of the people and medical workers are associated with confusion exhaustion fatigue and anger the image of women medical workers with shaved hair is associated with devotion and defeminizationin terms of rhetoric the report is not free from metaphor that powerful tool that can be invested for ideological purposes chinas power is compared to a machine of propaganda this machine has been weakened by a very tiny virus the image of women with shaved hair is a symbol of devotion obedience and defeminization the new york times even questions whether shaving womens hair comes from complete satisfaction or under extreme pressure war metaphor is used in the sentence beijing is tapping its old propaganda playbook as it battles the relentless coronavirus outbreak beijing is compared to a force battling a relentless coronavirus outbreak this force is not fully equipped and arranged to fight such a heartless ruthless and dangerous enemy beijing is only equipped with false and exaggerated statements and ideas this cannot beat a dangerous enemy like corona and win the battle in terms of repetition governments propaganda has been repeated to emphasize that beijings power is just propaganda unable to fight a dangerous enemy like corona governments shortcomings in controlling the virus as well as providing medical supplies are also repeated many times in the report women with shaved hair are also repeated and it serves as a sign of devotion and obedience to the government the story of dr li wenliang and other people the first doctor who warned the people from the new novel coronavirus is repeated many times in the report as a sign to refer to the totalitarian system in china the crisis has exposed many people especially the young to troubling aspects of life under an authoritarian government in the silencing of people like dr li they see the danger in clamping down on free expression the repetition of cartoon mascots named jiangshan jiao lovely land the name of the girl comes from a line in a poem entitled snow by mao zedong how lovely is this land with her handsome male and hongqi man free spirited red flag his name also comes from a line in the poem according to the new york times the idea behind this carton is to broadcast tales of unity and sacrifice behind beijings rulein terms of macrostructure the first headline entitled us covid-19 numbers tip of iceberg is used to refer to the number of cases of coronavirus in the us the numbers are described as tip of iceberg according to global times the few numbers of covid-19 cases in the us are just tip of iceberg and that the huge mass of the iceberg will appear with the next coming days or weeks the headline implies the following proposition there is a much bigger iceberg beyond this small tipthe superstructure of any discourse looks on how the events are arranged in terms of introduction substance and conclusion on one hand and what events are given more emphasis and prominent on the other the introduction illustrates that the us government and officials have harshly criticized chinas response to the coronavirus epidemic but then they have been caught under heavy fire for their response to the coronavirus outbreak in the country people are described as frustrated due to the rising numbers of new cases and the governments insufficient efforts to control the virus according to global times some americans have even dubbed the us governments response a national scandal that puts the fundamental interests of americans in jeopardy the substance obviously supports the introduction through giving many stories related to the governments slow response to the outbreak as well as the shortcomings in the healthcare system trumps administration is described as retarded and incompetence which has put many states in a state of emergency the us cdcs slow response is described as is politically driven totally ignoring the public interest testing in the us states is described as flawed the report also emphasized the fundamental contrast between chinas government responses to the outbreak with that of trumps administration china quickly responded adjusted measures to control the spread while the us response has now become shift-blame-tactics between the white house and us cdc some people in the us are described as worried about this new disease and its high contagiousness particularly as politicians are focused on campaigning for elections in november the conclusion ends with the importance of the chinese and us cooperation and the need for this cooperation as the two global powers can work together to overcome the outbreak the conclusion also emphasizes that the uss cdc should share information on developments in covid-19 and that it should provide regular reports to the world health organizationin terms of microstructure the first microstructure strategy is semantics in terms of semantics more contextual details are given to trumps administration uss cdc weaknesses frustrated people and their worries due to the virus spread and insufficient american healthcare system the phrase tip of iceberg which is used to refer to the number of cases of covid-19 in the us implies that the numbers will increase with the next days the tip of iceberg presupposes that there will be an iceberg formed by people with covid-19 the sentence citizens are demanding full transparency from officials implies that the us officials are not giving the people accurate information regarding the number of people with covid-19 and the spread of the outbreak the sentence the uss cdc has stopped reporting the number of people tested for the novel coronavirus implies a sense of suspicion a feeling that something bad is likely or true the word some is mentioned 10 times in the report some is associated with vagueness sentences such as some have even dubbed the us governments response a national scandal that puts the fundamental interests of americans in jeopardy some projections came up with real numbers far higher than those reported are associated with an indefinite amount and unspecified number blaming the victim and contrast and division strategies are also used in the report the report is full of blaming blaming of the us insufficient responses and bungled efforts to control the virus the retarded response and incompetence of the trump administration the newspaper blames the us cdcs slow response describing it as politically driven and ignoring public interest division and contrast strategy is also used in the report global times compares between the sufficient response of the chinese government and the insufficient response of trumps administration to the outbreakin terms of syntax most of the stories of the report are written in the past simple tense the best tense for narrating stories the sentences are written clearly in active form passive voice is not used in the report global times also used the present perfect tense-the preferable tense for hot news events or stories trump administration has placed several states in a state of emergency cdc has stopped reporting the number of people tested for the novel coronavirus pneumonia most of the stories are supported by clear agency or characterization complication and orientation giving places and times consider this story robert murphy an infectious diseases professor in the us and executive director of the institute for global health at the northwestern university feinberg school of medicine told the global times in an email on wednesday that he agrees with those who say the cdc has been making the same mistakes as wuhan at the beginning of the outbreak which included narrow testing criteria slow testing speed and lack of testing capacity resulting in the delayed responsein terms of lexis the prominent image of the us is associated with deficiency and insufficiency in providing testing kits and firm-decisive efforts to stop the pandemic spread the prominent image of people is associated with frustration wonder and worry about the disease citizens are also presented as powerful actors criticizing the countrys insufficient efforts to contain the virus politicians are busy with their election campaigns and do not want the disease to influence their polls the discourse of self and other is clearly used in the report the self discourse is always good and positive while the other discourse is always bad and negative china is represented as a positive country which is able to control the pandemic in contrast to the us the central government quickly stepped in and adjusted responding measures in contrast it has now become shift-blame-tactics between the white house and us cdc china is also described as a positive country ready to cooperate work together share responsibility and give advice consider this story wang guangfa a leading chinese respiratory expert at peking university first hospital in beijing urged the us cdc to share information on developments in the covid-19 outbreak in the us and take concrete steps to contain the spread of the virus with health departments of other major countries plagued by the virus and also provide regular reports to the world health organizationin terms of rhetoric the phrase tip of iceberg is a metaphor meaning that there is a lot more of covid-19 cases than meets the eye in the sentence the us government and officials are caught under heavy fire for their response to the coronavirus outbreak in the country the heavy fire is a metaphor for fear rage and anger anger of the citizens due to the uss insufficient efforts repetition as an ideological rhetorical strategy is used to negatively represent the us the us government and trumps administration are repeated for their shortages in controlling the virus the uss cdc is repeated 18 times for its slowness and weaknesses in dealing with the pandemic people are repeated criticizing the governments slow response to the outbreak the image of fear and worry in people is also repeated in the report china is repeated positively giving advice and offering cooperationthe second headline entitled us scrambles to tackle virus means that the us is unable to deal with a very tiny virus the headline is written in the present simple tense to make it more factual the verb scramble means to struggle with difficulty the us is struggling with a virus and this virus is not easy to deal within terms of superstructure the introduction illustrates the factors that are hindering the white houses readiness for the virus the main two impediments are political factors and testing delay the introduction also puts more emphasis on western and american media which have harshly criticized chinas government response to the outbreak but it happened that the virus have crept to western countries due to their insufficient awareness and few control measures in place to check its spread the substance supports the introduction and gives many different stories on the causes that will jeopardize the virus-control work and undermine the fundamental interests of the american public such causes are finger-pointing partisan politics and presidential election in the report trump is described as having little understanding about the pandemic ill-preparation shortages of medical supplies flaws in the us healthcare system lack of consistent commitment and coordination unprofessional response lack of information transparency related to the disease and expensive american healthcare system are other causes which help increase the spread and the risk of the virus the report ends with a conditional conclusion that if the us fails to contain the viral spread it would be a heavy blow not only to the us itself but also to the worlds economic recoverythe first microstructure strategy is semantics more stories supported by contextual details are given to the negative causes that allow the virus to spread in the us stories related to ill-preparation weaknesses in the political and administrative system and deficiencies in the uss cdc and healthcare system are the most prominent and emphasized stories in the whole report such negative stories are preferable and prominent the indefinite quantifier some is mentioned 6 times in the report although some is used to refer to indefinite number and amount it used in global times reports phrases such as some observers some raised questions some critics and some analysts are used in the report to give supports to the negative stories related to the shortcomings of the us government in dealing with the pandemic the quotation us president donald trump mistakenly described the patient who was a man in his 50 s as a wonderful women illustrates that global times always emphasizes confusion bewilderment and chaos in the us blaming the victim is clearly used in the report global times puts the blame on the us government under trumps administration and uss cdc for their shortages and ill-preparation regarding the spread of the outbreakin terms of syntax the report is clear and cohesive the sentence structure is presented clearly without vagueness active voice and agency are presented obviously in the report for no other purpose than to highlight the responsibility of the us government trump and uss cdc the newspaper does not use passive it seems that global times does not want to mitigate or hide the responsibility behind the spread of the virus in the us and the shortcomings and lack of medical supplies all such negative stories are highlighted and given more prominence in the report the report contains all the basic elements of a good narrative the report includes agency complications or different cohesive ties and conjunctions consider this quotation however us president donald trump mistakenly described the patient who was a man in his 50 s as a wonderful woman during a press conference while the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc later took the blame by claiming it mistakenly identified the patient as female in a briefing to trump and us vice president mike pence who is now overseeing the us federal governments response to the outbreakin terms of lexis the language of the report is negative full of negative stories and words powerful words and phrases with complex modifications and adjectives are widely used such as failure insufficient awareness few control measure finger-pointing partisan politics death ill-prepared cdcs faulty mass screenings highly possible shortages criticism flaws lack wrong loopholes lack of consistent commitment hasty and unprofessional response to the outbreak shortcomings failed raising fears overwhelmed problem slow response anxious the prominent image of the us and trump is associated with finger-pointing confusion lack of correct decisions loopholes shortcomings ill-preparation unprofessional and slow response to the outbreak the prominent image of people is associated with anxiety they are anxious as the facts are still unknown urging the us government to cope with the matter in a more responsible wayin terms of rhetoric repetition is the most rhetorical device that is used in this report most of the negative stories are repeated in the report the uss government shortcomings in controlling the virus are repeated the uss cdc slow and unprofessional response to the disease is repeated the expensive american healthcare system is repeated peoples concerns about and criticism to the slow and weakness response of the government are also repeatedundoubtedly data analysis proves that the pandemic which is known as covid-19 has been politicized and used ideologically in other words the two selected newspapers namely the new york times from the united states of america and global times from china politicized the pandemic to serve the interests and ideologies of the countries they representboth newspapers invested the three discourse structure namely macrostructure superstructure and microstructure ideologically in their reports the newspapers gave more emphasis and prominence to the negative stories related to the covid-19 new york times put more emphasis on the propaganda of the communist party in china its inability to control the spread of the outbreak its weaknesses in controlling the virus its shortcomings in providing medical supplies and its totalitarian treatment to the people and medical workers people are dissatisfied with the governments decisions and shortcomings global times also emphasized the negative stories related to covid-19 in the us the us government under trumps administration is weak and slow in its response to the virus the uss cdc is described as slow and unprofessional in its response to the outbreak negative stories related to the lack of testing kits and medical supplies are repeated and emphasized in the reports people are angry and anxious due to the governments slow response american expensive healthcare system and weaknesses are also repeated and given more prominencethe article recommends that the whole world should work together for peace safety and security pandemics and epidemics do not know borders or china or united states such deadly diseases do not distinguish between a christian a jew a muslim or an atheist they also do not distinguish between an american asian or european therefore we should work together to save ourselves and the next coming generationsparticipants were recruited

after reading this text individuals responded to four dependent measures measured on a seven-point scale ranging from strongly disagree 1 to strongly agree 7 the first is a behavioral intention question  i will wear a mask every time i leave my home the next two are attitudinal questions  it is best for society if everyone wears a mask when they leave their home and i dont think wearing a mask will impact the spread of the coronavirus a final question asking participants whether they would like to get more information about purchasing face masks was asked as a yes or no question to better get at behavior rather than behavioral intentionthese analyses follow a pre-analysis plan registered with open science framework osf at httpsosfiogbpnq recall that both hypotheses are conditional on ideology  promotion messages should work better with liberals and prevention messages better with conservatives three sets of analyses were pre-registered in this plansince rft predictions about ideology focus primarily on direction of ideology rather than strength choma busseri and sadava 2009 i first separate ideology between liberals and conservatives ideology was asked on the standard american national election study anes seven-point scale allowing respondents to select responses ranging from very conservative to very liberal with an option for respondents to select that they havent thought much about thisthose who report their ideology as moderatemiddle of the road or respond that they havent thought much about this are excluded from analysis respondents who answer very conservative conservative or somewhat conservative are coded as conservative while those who answer very liberal liberal or somewhat liberal will be coded as liberal this creates a dichotomous measure of ideology with individuals coded as either liberal 1 or conservative 0 this measure is then interacted with each of the treatments with the control group serving as reference of course rft provides relatively unclear predictions about how strength of ideology might impact the power of these types of messages on attitudes and behaviors as an additional set of analyses i interact the full ideological measure ranging from very conservative to very liberal with the treatments rather than the dichotomous measure this allows for the inclusion of ideological moderates in these analyses but still requires excluding those who do not place themselves on the ideological scaleas a last set of analyses i examine these relationships conditional on a match between a participants stated partisanship and the partisanship of their governor given that recent work finds that individuals are less likely to comply with measures when they do not share partisanship with their governor cornelson and miloucheva 2020 while there is little theory available to suggest that types of messages might interact with this it is an important exploratory analysis given the findings of cornelson and miloucheva 2020 which are directly related to covid-19 this will create a three-way interaction between the treatments respondent ideology and respondent co-partisanship with their states governor individual partisanship is based off of the standard two-pronged anes partisanship question including partisan leaners this is matched with an individuals self-reported state of residence and the partisanship of the current governor of that stategiven that this research design relies upon an observed moderator of ideology i include controls for observed covariates kam and trussler 2017  age gender race education and whether a respondent has a co-partisan governor or not since research shows this affects compliance with covid-19 related regulations cornelson and miloucheva 2020the results of the first set of analyses based on a binary ideological indicator are presented graphically in figure 1

 the results for a moderation by the seven-point ideological measure are available in figure 2 while the results for moderation by both ideology and gubernatorial co-partisanship are presented in figure 3 all regression models are available in the appendix supplementary material





as shown in figure 1 interesting though primarily null results emerge there are no differences between treatments for anyone on the intention to buy mask measure  individuals were equally likely across treatment groups and ideologies to request information on where to purchase a mask the behavioral intention variable however shows that the promotion message has an effect on desire to wear a mask however contrary to expectations this does not increase the willingness of liberals but decreases the willingness of conservatives to wear a mask relative to both the control and prevention message similar patterns emerge for the attitudinal measures  liberals are not affected significantly by the treatments but conservatives are less likely to see the benefit of masks and more likely to believe they will not impact the spread when exposed to the promotion message compared to the control and the prevention messagethese results are substantively similar though a bit more difficult to digest and less statistically precise the gap between treatments still tends to dampen for liberals and is larger for conservatives but does not reach conventional levels of statistical significance it appears however that the effect of messages is more conditional upon direction of ideology rather than strength as no major differences in treatment effects emerge for strong and slight conservativesthese results show little difference based on shared partisanship with ones governor for conservatives  regardless of partisanship of a conservative respondents governor they respond to the messages in similar fashion and the promotion message still seems to dampen their compliance with and favorability of the mask wearing measure for liberals however a different pattern emerges in line with expectations from rft when liberals are exposed to the promotion message their attitudes toward mask wearing change compared to the other messages dependent upon their governors partisanship liberals are more likely to believe that wearing masks is best for society and is less likely to believe that it will not impact the spread of coronavirus when exposed to the promotion message but only when their governor shares their partisanship these differences disappear when their governor does not share their partisanshipthese analyses find little support for how rft can inform our messaging about mask wearing during the covid-19 crisis while messages related to prevention seem to have no impact on behaviors and attitudes toward wearing facial masks regardless of individual ideology promotion related messages do have some impact though in unpredicted ways rft argues that liberals should be more receptive to promotion messages and i find some very limited support of this prediction respond positively to promotion messages under a specific condition  that they share partisanship with their states governor however the most consistent effects occur with conservatives showing less support for mask wearing when exposed to the promotion message  a finding not in line with predictions which predict that conservatives should not be affected differently by this message than the control messagewhy are prevention messages no more or less effective than a purely information message while this study is unable to examine the exact mechanism perhaps prevention messages simply do not work in this context official and unofficial messaging about the covid-19 crisis has heavily focused on prevention  flattening the curve is about stopping and slowing infections an inherently prevention focused message perhaps the focus on prevention messages in general has rendered additional information about prevention moot or perhaps individuals think of the mask wearing recommendation as prevention message by defaultin general this provides little support for targeting prevention and promotion messages based on ideology as rft would suggest related to mask wearing in response to the covid-19 crisis it seems that generally control messaging without a promotion or prevention cue and prevention messaging work equally well at promoting pro-mask attitudes and behaviors while a difference emerges related to promotion messaging it is unexpected and not in line with rft predictions serving to dampen support from conservatives further work should examine this unexpected finding to determine whether it is specifically related to the covid-19 crisis or if it broadly extends to how conservatives receive promotion focused messagesthis leaves policy recommendations a bit muddled  to the extent there is an impact it is that promotion messages make conservatives less complaint this suggests that a purely informational message without an additional prod may be the most effective strategy  since the evidence here provides little support for rft theories of ideological differences in response to messaging about mask wearing during the covid-19 crisis it is likely easiest to provide a straightforward messagethe covid-19 the disease caused by a novel coronavirus and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly across the globe it has caused outbreaks of illness due to person-to-person transmission of the virus mainly via close contacts and droplets produced by an infected persons cough or sneeze 1 exhaled droplets from infected patients with covid-19 can deposit in the noses mouths and eyes of people nearby they can also be inhaled into the lungs and leads to respiratory illness such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndromealthough aerosol therapy is a mainstay procedure used to treat pulmonary diseases at home and healthcare settings it has a potential for fugitive emissions during therapy due to the generation of aerosols and droplets as a source of respiratory pathogens fugitive emission is defined as aerosols that have been released from the aerosol device during patient expiration it is also medical aerosols that are not inhaled by the patient but passes into the atmosphere according to previous studies the particle size of fugitive emissions ranges from 0860 to 1437 m and up to 50 of the generated aerosol during therapy was fugitive aerosol remain airborne in the indoor environment for several hours 2 3 4 5 6 the device interface patient type and flow rate affect the quantity and characteristics of the fugitive emissions while the dimensions and layout of the room air turbulence airflow rates and temperature impact dispersion and decay 478 in a recent in vitro study a home attending healthcare worker was simulated with a manikin using a facemask that was placed at three different distances the findings of this study showed that total aerosol concentration ranged from 0002 to 010 mgm3 depending on the distance of the manikin relative to the aerosol source 9 although previous studies showed an increase in the quantity of aerosol concentration in the ambient air it is important to note that they are in vitro studies that cannot differentiate medical aerosol from bioaerosol while bioaerosols are generated by patients medical aerosols are produced by aerosol devices it is clear that covid-19 is spread by droplets generated as bioaerosols also it has been reported that aerosol transmission of sars-cov-2 is plausible because the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours 1011 for instance most of the contamination seems to be from surfaces where the droplets settle and persist for up to a week that is why dispersion distance of aerosols is such an important point if a patient coughs without a mask the dispersion is much wider than wearing a simple mask and it is safer for the healthcare workers to be within 3 feet the studies conducted by hui et al identified dispersion distances depending on the aerosol generating procedures and the intervention like mask over cannula 12 13 14 15 16 therefore the radius of risk associated procedures can offer some guidance for healthcare professionals at the bedsidedelivering aerosolized medications to patients with covid-19 can aggravate the spread of the novel coronavirus this has been a real concern for caregivers and healthcare professionals who are susceptible to unintended inhalation of fugitive emissions during therapy due to a scarcity of information in this area of clinical practice the purpose of this paper is to explain how to deliver aerosolized medications to mild- sub-intensive and intensive-patients with covid-19 and how to protect staff from exposure to exhaled droplets during aerosol therapy
aerosol therapy in mild-patients with covid-19 while aerosol therapy is a critical and integral part of the clinical management of patients with pulmonary diseases it increases the droplet generation and risk of disease transmission therefore it is crucial to avoid unnecessary aerosol drug delivery to patients with covid-19 according to previous research patients with asthma have a risk for other coronaviruses such as middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infection and have a potential risk for covid-19 17 however in spontaneously breathing patients with copd or asthma the routine use of aerosolized medications is essential to keep the disease symptoms under control while some reports have suggested avoiding the use of corticosteroids during the covid-19 pandemic it is important to note that the reports were made based on data obtained in hospitalized patients with covid-19 who had a poor response to systemic corticosteroids after the onset of the disease therefore the global initiative for asthma gina recommends using prescribed inhaled corticosteroids to prevent the worsening of asthma and the serious consequences of asthma attacks 18 also there is a lack of information on the risk of patients taking oral or inhaled corticosteroids for asthma control or risk of poor outcomes from coronavirusin mild-patients with covid-19 who are awake and can perform specific breathing techniques with inhalers clinicians should consider using pressurized metered-dose inhalers pmdis and dry powder inhalers dpis for aerosol drug delivery instead of nebulizers it is essential to use a valved-holding chamber with pmdis during treatment also priming before first use pmdi actuation at the beginning of inspiration hand breath coordination inhalation with low inspiratory flows and breath-hold is vital for the efficiency of pmdi since dpis are breath-actuated inhalers clinicians should emphasize the specific inspiratory flow needed to draw medication from the device and disperse the particles thus patients can operate the dpi correctly and receive therapeutic benefit from the drug however patients with acute respiratory failure may not generate the adequate inspiratory flow needed for the specific dpi used for treatment in addition if the inhaler increases cough other alternatives should be pursued using nebulizers with a mouthpiece or high flow nasal cannula should be considered in such casesunlike inhalers nebulizers can deliver a variety of drug formulations that may be needed for patients with covid-19 although conventional jet nebulizers are commonly used to deliver aerosolized medications they may also spew 23 of the emitted aerosol into the ambient environment 19 20 21 in this case healthcare providers are exposed not only the inhaled medications but also to the droplets from the patients airways and lungs in addition the driving gas up to 10 lmin can increase the dispersion of both medical and bioaerosols if aerosols generated with nebulizers carry the virus during exhalation and transmit it to the hospital environment health care providers and other patients are under the risk of infection recently some companies manufacturing jet nebulizers provided filters to use with their device in the treatment of patients with covid-19 while the placement of a filter to the nebulizer was 93 effective in capturing exhaled aerosol droplets 22 and will reduce second hand exposure of aerosol medication to health care professionals 2324 the efficiency of these filters in preventing the transmission and the magnitude of the risk acquiring coronavirus through filtered nebulizers are not fully known also current publications on fugitive emissions are based on in vitro studies that may not be a true representative of a real exhalation in coronavirus infected patients using the high-efficiency particulate air hepa filters with nebulizers might be a good option during aerosol drug delivery to patients with covid-19 due to a greater surface of filtration they are more effective in collecting droplets compared to other bacterial filters available on the market however their bulky designs and requirement to use various adapters to attach them to nebulizers make it difficult to use them compared to low volume bacteria filtersinterface selection is as important as device selection in aerosol therapy using a facemask is not recommended for aerosol therapy in the treatment of coronavirus infected patients when a jet nebulizer is combined with a facemask the airflow of jet nebulizer will force aerosol out of the device during expiration and breath-hold mcgrath et al showed that the face mask had the highest-time averaged fugitively emitted aerosol concentration when a jet nebulizer was combined with a facemask they also reported that placing a filter on the exhalation port of the mouthpiece lead to the lowest concentration 6 therefore the jet nebulizers need to be used with the mouthpiece and clinicians should attach filters or one-way valves to the large bore tubing of the nebulizer to prevent fugitive emissions during aerosol therapy another option would be to use a mesh nebulizer combined with the mouthpiece in patients with covid-19 in this case clinicians should add a filter to the other end of the mouthpiece to eliminate the release of aerosols to the environmentmany suspected patients with covid-19 are recommended to stay at home telehealth would be a good option to evaluate them at home and minimize the utilization of healthcare facilities by them smart phones can be used to provide telehealth services to patients with covid-19 as they are equivalent of a hand-held computer although healthcare providers and patients do not need to be in the same physical location there are some challenges with the use of telehealth in this pandemic for instance the healthcare provider cannot measure the temperature if the patient does not have a thermometer at home lighting at the patients home can make assessing cyanosis difficult evaluation of throat nose or ears is also difficult if patient has upper respiratory symptoms using telehealth in this pandemic is a strategic initiative and achieving a careful balance of treatment effectiveness and patient safety require policy makers and stakeholders shape telehealth moving forward through a thoughtful framework for the practive use and reimbursement of telehealth in coronavirus infected patients table 1

aerosol therapy in sub-intensive-patients with covid-19 high flow nasal cannula hfnc is commonly used in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure 25 26 27 due to a limited number of ventilators available at hospitals using hfnc may be a good option to use before patients with asthma and copd develop severe hypoxemic respiratory failure however secondary inhalation of emissions released from the patients with covid-19 using hfnc is a real concern it leads to the risk of dispersion of aerosolized virus because hfnc does not have a closed circuit unlike ventilators although previous studies showed a low risk of airborne transmission with hfnc when good interface fitting is achieved 141628 the safety of using hfnc in patients with coronavirus as well as the riskbenefit ratio for aerosol drug delivery through hfnc has not been investigated previous research reported that increasing the flow decreased the fugitive emissions and particle size of aerosols during therapy 6 if aerosolized medications need to be delivered through hfnc clinicians should place surgical masks on infected patients faces during hfnc 132930 and administer aerosol therapy in negative pressure rooms respiratory therapists should also wear personal protective equipment including an n95 respirator gogglesface shield double gloves gown or apron if the gown is not fluid resistant table 2

aerosol therapy in intensive-patients with covid-19 recently published studies showed that two thirds of patients with covid-19 develop acute respiratory distress syndrome 31 it takes 910 days for patients with covid-19 deteriorate and require intensive care for respiratory support 32 nebulizers may be needed in critically ill patients with covid-19 receiving ventilatory support in this case it is vital to keep the circuit intact and prevent the transmission of the virus therefore delivering aerosolized medications via jet nebulizer or pmdis will not be appropriate due to the breakage of the circuits for the placement of the device on the ventilator circuit before aerosol therapy a recently published chinese guideline suggests using the mesh nebulizer in critically ill patients with covid-19 receiving ventilator support 30 mesh nebulizers can stay in-line for up to 28 days and reservoir design allows adding medication without requiring the ventilator circuit to be broken for aerosol drug delivery unlike jet nebulizer the medication reservoir of mesh nebulizers is isolated from the breathing circuit that eliminates the nebulization of contaminated fluids also placing the mesh or jet nebulizer prior to the humidifier can improve the efficiency of the treatment and further reduce retrograde contamination from the patient 33 34 35 36 37 38also it is important to remember that exhaled particles from intubated patients are less than 2 m that do not deposit via sedimentation or inertial impaction they remain suspended in the air and can pose a serious risk to healthcare professionals as low concentration exposure is sufficient for the transmission of coronavirus in our previous research we quantified the amount of aerosol collected at the exhaust outlet of a ventilator operated with and without filters in the expiratory limb of the circuit 23 we found that drug deposited at the exhaust port without expiratory filters was 160 fold higher that with expiratory filters and placing a filter in the expiratory limb significantly reduces secondhand aerosol exposure 23 since aerosol drug delivery to ventilator-dependent patients can readily be transmitted to the ambient environment it is critical to use the hepa filters to prevent the transmission of infectious droplet nuclei through the ventilatorssometimes aerosol therapy is combined with pulmonary clearance techniques such as chest physical therapy and suctioning since coughing generates droplet nuclei capable of transmitting the coronavirus it is not recommended to administer aerosolized medications along with chest physical therapy in the acute phase of the disease if the patient with covid-19 is intubated and needs endotracheal suctioning during mechanical ventilation in-line or closed system suction catheters should be used as they can be utilized up to 7 days without having to break the ventilator circuit although there are multiple designs of closed suction catheters no significant difference was found on aerosol drug delivery to simulated ventilator dependent adults using different designs of closed suction catheters 39 table 3

infection control during aerosol therapy the risk of exposure to exhaled aerosols among health care professionals has been a real concern in the covid-19 pandemic aerosols entering the ambient environment increase the risk of exposure to the virus and may expose respiratory therapists and other healthcare professionals to the pathogen during patient treatment monitoring equipment cleaning and maintenance in the hospital setting previous research showed that exposure to the virus and poor compliance with infection control procedures are associated with occupationally acquired infection in healthcare settings 40 41 42 43 44delivering to aerosolized medications to patients with covid-19 who have spontaneous breathing or receive noninvasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula are of particularly high risk 45 if aerosolized medications need to be used in patients with covid-19 clinicians should isolate patients in an airborne infection isolation room aiir or negative pressure rooms with a minimum of 12 air changes per hour or at least 160 litersspatient in facilities with natural ventilation in addition respiratory therapists and health care professionals providing aerosol therapy should be trained on infection prevention and control recommendations for covid-19 they must adhere to airborne precautions and use personal protective equipment properly hand hygiene and double gloving should be a standard practice in all healthcare facilities in addition healthcare professionals should use surgical respirators such as n95 or ffp2 standard or equivalent gogglesface shield gloves gowns and aprons if gowns are not resistant to fluid during aerosol therapy 46 cleaning hands before and after treatment with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is extremely important other infection control strategies include minimizing the number of times that healthcare workers enter the rooms of covid-19 patients by bundling the activitiestreatments and restricting others who are not involved in direct patient care from entering the patients room currently a shortage of surgical n95 respirators is expected in this case healthcare professionals should consider using the same mask in the treatment of multiple patients with covid-19 however previous studies reported that the use of the same respirator for more than 4 h might lead to discomfort 4748this pandemic has taught us the importance of infection prevention and control measures as well as teamwork in health care settings it is important for respiratory therapists to team up with other healthcare professionals in isolating coronavirus infected patients in aiir and assigning designated staff who can provide effective and safe delivery of aerosolized medications to this patient population although respiratory therapists and other healthcare providers face a major and unique challenge in this pandemic they are on the front stage and build a strong platform to ensure the health safety and well-being of patients with coronavirus the upside of this pandemic is that we can teach respiratory therapists and other healthcare professionals the importance of personal protection and safe practices that might carry over for a safer workplace in the futurethe treatment of patients with covid-19 is different from the disease management of patients with pulmonary diseases who need aerosol therapy however it is imperative during the pandemic to assume that all patients may be infected so good personal protection and aerosol administration practices should be applied clinical studies on covid-19 are limited and there is a lack of information and guidance on how to administer aerosolized medications to this patient population also the effective delivery of aerosolized medications to patients with covid-19 may require modifications in the dose frequency and delivery technique that need to be used for aerosol drug delivery in coronavirus infected patients while our deepest fear is that we are inadequate in terms of resources and knowledge about coronavirus the choice does not belong to pessimism and scare it belongs to us as marie curie said nothing in life is to be feared it is only to be understood now is the time to understand more so that we may fear less we are strong when we know our fears and limitations therefore it is time to start thinking about what is necessary and doing what is possible using a proactive and comprehensive approach to aerosol drug delivery to patients with covid-19 respiratory therapists have enormous experience on aerosol therapy and the foundation of delivering aerosolized medications to coronavirus infected patients should be grounded in their experience and current guidelines on covid-19i received research grants from arc medical bayer pharmaceuticals sunovion pharmaceuticals and aerogen ltd however i have not received any input or funding from these companies in the preparation of this manuscriptthe 2002 sars outbreak in southern china has only limited value for predictions even if both are coronaviruses sars largely died out during the northern hemisphere summer of 2003 when the virus became significantly less infectious however while the covid19 virus appears to be considerably less lethal than sars which had a fatality rate of 96 killing 774 of the 8098 reported patients 1 it is more infectious and though the virus was very quickly identified and its genome sequenced it does not automatically translate into detailed information about infectivity virulence and how it interacts with the human immune systemone of the earlier suggestions that has now been largely scotched was that the covid19 virus became infectious before patients showed the first symptoms which would make containment measures such as quarantining less effective like locking the stable door after the horse has bolted this hypothesis arose after a cluster of cases was reported in germany appearing to have originated from an individual who had flown in from china but did not report symptoms until after returning to china however as was pointed out by amesh adalja senior scholar at the johns hopkins centre for health security it was then established that the person had indeed experienced symptoms in germany before they were reported by other people in that clusterwhat is true though is that a significant number of people infected have experienced mild symptoms which itself is a problem during the early stages of an outbreak when strenuous efforts are being made to prevent its spread it means some cases will go undetected because the symptoms are so mild that coronavirus infection is not suspected at least initially as jeremy farrar director of the wellcome trust pointed out early on the wide range of severity in symptoms is one of the major challenges the cases of patients with only very mild symptoms or people who are asymptomatic may be masking the true numbers infected and the extent of persontoperson transmissionseveral key aspects of the covid19 virus are more clear now one being that it is likely to subside during the summer similar to the sars outbreak in 2002 as most coronaviruses become far less infectious under warm weather these respiratory infections all tend to be winter diseases said by paul hunter professor of health protection at the norwich school of medicine university of east anglia uk the big one that stopped sars was summer in the northern hemisphere this has the corollary that warm countries are much less affected hunter noted there was only one single case of sars in the whole of africa and that was south africa where there are seasonal variations in temperature however he also cautioned against complacency noting that mexico experienced quite a high number of cases during the 2009 influenza a h1n1 pandemic despite the country being hot except at higher altitudes inland so there are other factors determining infectivity beyond temperature hunter addedit is however the virus infectivity which has prompted fears that it could become endemic it is substantially less lethal than sars but a lot more infectious hunter said on the other hand it is substantially less infectious than seasonal influenza but more lethal as a result the degree of severity has been exaggerated by the data so far while almost all the extreme and fatal cases have been notified there has been considerable underreporting of mild cases early data on closed cases that is people who had either died or recovered indicated a fatality rate as high as 20 at time of writing however the death rate among more recent cases had subsided to about 15 with the highest risk for the elderlythis pattern is typical of most respiratory virus outbreaks even if part of the effect is an illusion resulting from the fact that reporting of less severe cases only tends to catch up later on it also reflects the common decline of virulence during such epidemics partly resulting from strong selective pressure imposed by social distancing quarantine and other public health measures 2 these measures reduce the rate of transmission and slow down progression of the outbreak giving the virus more time to attenuate social distancing amplifies selection for longersurviving lowvirulence subgroups so that the majority of the population during the later stages of an outbreak are exposed to less virulent phenotypes 2in addition many of the most vulnerable individuals are infected earlier on so that later cases are also less serious because they involve more robust individuals according to hunter in the longer term the wuhan virus should not be anywhere near as serious because an endemic disease affects more young people who are by then the nonimmunes he said that was indeed the case even for the great spanish influenza pandemic 191819 which caused a much larger proportion of severe cases and deaths among younger people than most other flu outbreaks that was when spanish flu was in its first flush not after it had become endemic hunter explainedseen in this light criticisms of the quarantining and other social distancing methods employed against the coronavirus are either overreactions or wide of the mark even if they fail to contain the outbreak they effectively accelerate the attenuation process and should reduce the number of severe cases and fatalities in this regard the chinese authorities have won widespread praise for the rapid reactions once the severity of the outbreak had become clear both in terms of identifying the virus and of isolating infected individualsthe excellence of the chinese response is first of all making the early diagnosis that it was coronavirus and secondly that it was a novel coronavirus and then sequencing the genome in very short order was brilliant said william schaffner infectious diseases specialist at vanderbilt university medical centre nashville tennessee usa then they did something else that was also terrific that they had learnt from sars they communicated that information transparently completely honestly and instantaneously to the worlds scientific community that meant three things happens immediately firstly countries around the world including our own cdc centres for disease control quickly ran their own pcr tests in their own laboratories and so were able to implement testing very promptly number two within hours of transmission of that genomic information people began working on a vaccine  number three research began looking for therapies both new compounds and among existing compounds that might have an effect on that virusschaffner also a past president of the us national foundation for infectious diseases was less complementary though about the chinese communication about transmission within the key areas especially wuhan over time on the public health side we have established very standard methods pioneered by the cdc epidemiologists to do public health interventions in the field he explained there is concern that those rigorous epidemiological methods still have not been employed optimally in china that public health information and the clinical information is only just now being shared there has been reluctance on that aspect to transmit that information transparently and quickly as schaffner added the who and cdc now have standing offers to work with their chinese counterparts in the field but so far those have not been acceptedaccording to schaffner the chinese command and control method of governance has enabled them rapidly to quarantine up to 50 million people in the affected areas but it works less well when it comes to disseminating more sensitive information he does feel it is a missed opportunity for china to show itself in a positive light i think it ought to have been a matter of national pride said schaffner it should have been an opportunity to show how open the country is to the worldthis could also delay the return to normality when the outbreak does start subsiding schaffner identified two possible metrics that could be used by global health authorities to determine when it would be safe to return to business as usual one is a determination of new cases in wuhan he explained but to have confidence in that metric we need to be sure that testing intensity is reasonably constant  we are not sure how reliable that is schaffner therefore suggested that the rest of the world would be unable to rely on that metric there may though be one other metric that can help us and that is the number of exportations from wuhan and hubei the other area district at the epicentre of the outbreak to other parts of china and the rest of the world he added if you can show a diminution in those exportations that will give public health and governments generally the confidence they can back off some of these quarantine restrictionsthere is though growing optimism over developing therapies against the covid19 virus this applies particularly to vaccines and antibodies to neutralize the active sites of the virus surface that expedite the penetration of host cells according to michael farzan cochair of the department of immunology and microbiology scripps research la jolla ca usa this virus is a close cousin of sarscov and like sarscov it chooses meaning has been selected to move rapidly from host to host before an adaptive immune response emerges he explained because of this and unlike hiv1 and ebolavirus it keeps its key epitopes exposed probably so that it can be more efficient at binding the next cell this makes it very vulnerable to antibody neutralization and thus it is a relatively easy virus to protect against i refer to it as stupid on a spectrum where hiv which lives in the face of an active immune system for years is a geniusfurthermore as farzan added it does not mutate rapidly for an rna virus because unusually for this category it has a proofreading function in its polymerase 3 in short a vaccine and especially a vaccine targeted in part to the receptorbinding domain of the 2019ncov entry protein the spike or s protein should be effective he said as this protein is protected against mutation a vaccine would not need regular updates unlike seasonal influenza vaccinesanother longstanding question is the exact sequence of events and interactions with the host immune system in severe and fatal cases death usually results from respiratory failure following pneumonia which is either caused directly by the virus or caused by secondary infection by opportunistic bacteria such as streptococcus in the case of influenza outbreaks pneumonia usually results from secondary bacterial infections that come in only when the primary virus infection has subsided indeed the majority of deaths associated with the great spanish influenza pandemic of 19181919 were caused not by the influenza virus alone but by bacterial pneumonia following the initial viral infection 4unlike influenza viruses however some coronaviruses such as covid19 are believed to cause pneumonia directly although that does not prevent subsequent bacterial secondary infections there is already evidence that the virus has caused some severe cases of pneumonia directly with no evidence of other known respiratory viral or bacterial pathogens after conducting microbiological testing 5there is still debate over the relative roles of primary viral and secondary bacterial pneumonia in the wuhan outbreak and how to deal with it hunter is convinced that it is a primary viral pneumonia echoing some of the early studies as well as more extensive analysis of the sars outbreak 6 my reason for that is people are saying antibiotics dont work in this case and they work for secondary pneumonia but not primary also the early symptoms of this novel coronavirus infection are in the lower respiratory tract this again is unlike most if not all influenza virus strains where lower respiratory tract symptoms come later presumably from secondary bacterial infectionhunter agreed though that some patients will get secondary bacterial pneumonia as well and that could account for some of the severe cases however john edmunds who develops control programmes for disease at the london school of health and tropical medicine in the uk reckons that the relative roles of bacterial and viral pneumonia are not yet clear some anecdotal reports seem to suggest that most patients are initially ok and then get severe disease which might indicate a bacterial superinfection but how consistent this pattern is is anyones guess again there is a lack of clinical as well as epidemiological data that are coming out edmunds commented this question of viral versus bacterial pneumonia is important for treatment because the latter would require the routine use of antibiotics whereas the primary viral infections would be treated with antivirals and antibodiesoverall as the outbreak continues to develop and new data come out of china there are at least good prospects of treating patients with antiviral and antibody treatments until an efficient vaccine becomes availablehave you heard the story about fidel castro and the ugandan army you know the one where after years of fighting yoweri museveni and the national resistance movement come to power in 1986 and shortly after sending the new ugandan army to cuba for army medicals find that some soldiers are hiv positive on discovering this so the story goes museveni decides to be a leading example in the global response to hivaids to avoid any stigma or accusations that his military is weak several people told me this story when i was researching hivaids in kampala in 2005 i now tell it to my students embellishing a phone call between castro and museveni the story gets a bit distorted as i try to hold the attention of 90 undergraduate students but does not lose the power of what it communicates about the relationship between militaries national security and global health the story could be made up another folk tale spread by museveni or his political opponents but it makes sense to the people who believe it and provides an insight into why militaries became a focus of the hivaids response in the early 2000sanyone working in science medicine and global health would have heard a story like thisan explanation as to how things came to be that is not necessarily based on evidence fact or peer-reviewed research as efforts to contain coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 show one part of responding to outbreaks is to control the stories and misinformation that spread good science and evidence-based medicine can lead us to dismiss such stories especially if they perpetuate falsehoods or a threat to life stories in this respect are dangerous they are dangerous when they spread false information they are dangerous when we impose single narratives and they are dangerous when we think them irrelevant to the work of science medicine and global health

stories become dangerous when we overlook or dismiss them as a source of knowledge if the 201416 outbreak of ebola taught us anything it is if you want to understand how a disease spreads look to the stories of the communities it affects stories of foreign actors coming into communities to spread disease matter because they change how communities and individuals are engaged in information exchange stories about fear of the military matter as they suggest inducement to behaviour change is more about short-term fear of immediate harm than long-term health and protection if you do not listen to these stories any intervention to stop the spread of diseases however scientifically advanced is likely to failtoo often when we dismiss stories we dismiss women in many low-income and middle-income countries it is women who experience the front line of health services we know that it is women who bear the brunt of delivering on global targets of child health are understandably the focus of maternal health and are the ones more likely to go to hivaids care and treatment clinics to collect anti-retroviral treatment for themselves and their husbands however womens everyday knowledge and stories of how health systems function in particular settings are usually devalued or ignored especially in policy and agenda setting all too often womens stories reveal inconvenient truths for governments and international actors the starkest examples come from womens stories of seeking abortion outside of formal health systems in countries where access to safe abortion is restricted or criminalisedthen there are the stories of women avoiding clinics to deliver their babies because they know someone who went to the clinic and did not come out alive scientific evidence from around the world shows that safe delivery with a skilled birth attendant and available support for birth complications reduce risks to both baby and mother however such evidence does not necessarily stack up if your lived reality is clinics that can be more than 50 km away from your home are often understaffed do not have basic supplies may charge hidden fees and possibly detain you if you cant pay and are the same place your aunty died in the past these sorts of circumstances do not count as scientific evidence but such stories draw on knowledge derived from experience and matter when pregnant women weigh up their birthing options stories may contradict scientific evidence but they are derived from an everyday perception you can throw as many incentivesbaby kits small payments education campaignsto get women to deliver in clinics but unless you listen and see the stories of these women as an everyday reality of how health systems work little will changeother stories have much greater visibility the rise of the global health hero story in the past decades obscures women further men working in global health have cemented their leadership through biographies and high-profile interviews that focus on their life stories male dominance of such stories is perhaps unsurprising given men disproportionately assume leadership positions in global health however male-dominated story-telling has important impacts on the wider politics of global health governance it increases the space men take up in our narratives and imagination on global health reproducing the norm of men as leaders and individual visionaries that get things donethe single heroic leader with the necessary vision dynamism and obstinacy to address the worlds greatest problems focusing on the individual or emphasising their stubborn quest for change obscures the collaborative nature on which most breakthroughs and delivery in science and global public health take place it also runs the risk of creating false idols looked to as the solutions for every crisisthe individual hero the single narrative invisible women and the stories we dismiss all point to the ethical dangers of who has the right to tell use and consume stories too often stories are used in ways that allow audiences to eat the trauma of the story-teller eating trauma has long been a device of international charities in their fundraising appeals this presents a conundrum to story-telling in global health how to communicate humanity in a way that does not feast on the trauma of others we need to think through the ethics of how we use stories in our work the role of the story-tellers and the platforms and context in which they are happy or consent to story-telling there is an ethical imperative to go beyond writer chimamanda ngozi adichies warning of the single story wherein power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person but to make it the definitive story of that person to recognise the complexity of individual characters and fundamentally to allow the story to adapt and change as people adapt and change story-tellers have to own their story and how it is told and usedthe growth in measles in the usa and loss of elimination status during 2019 in albania czech republic greece and the uk show the dangerous impact stories can have on the health of a population stories about the side-effects of vaccines based on rumour or something read on the internet are never based on fact but presented in a way that grasps the attention of concerned parents given the dangers of such anti-vaxxer narratives the default would understandably be to dismiss such quackery and restate the science yet to dismiss is to be remiss what such stories even dangerous ones show us is how society is responding and making sense of advances in science and medicine dangerous stories gain greater traction in times of economic and political instability stories cannot simply be rebuffed by science because at their core is a fiction and construction of a narrative that people can understand and for some reason trust want to believe or are encouraged to believe by politicians family members or neighbours among others more than science and evidence appreciating the context in which such dangerous stories arise can help challenge themin many ways actors working in science and medicine recognise the power of stories to educate inform and create empathy and in so doing are telling stories to popular audiences the counter to fake news and false narratives is that people want to engage with knowledge facts and evidence audiences who may not read medical journals still marvel at advances in science and the politics of health and seek knowledge to make sense of the world especially at a time when the quality of debate and evidence in the political world is found wantingthe desire for knowledge and stories that help us make sense of ourselves our bodies and place in the world is reflected in the stories we want to read see and hear the burst of clinician memoirs such as adam kays this is going to hurt amanda browns the prison doctor and elizabeth fords sometimes amazing things happen has disrupted the dominance of how-to-get-rich diet and self-help books in non-fiction reading hospital dramas continue to be popular draws to television and streaming audiences after the success of the global health film festival who will host its own film festival the health for all film festival this year audiences want stories about health and the people and systems that provide health care people are curious about the mysteries of organs such as the brain and are thrilled by stories of neurosurgeons such as henry marsh because he explains not only how the brain works but also his relationships with patients colleagues and his own health we want to kick away the pedestal to see how clinicians cope with the everyday possibility of life and death in turn clinicians want to share their stories as a means of making sense of their own work and connecting with their patients common humanity expressed through stories connects story-tellers and audiences clinicians and patientsthe corollary to the danger of stories is that stories make people less scared fear comes from uncertainty misunderstanding and a failure to recognise humanity in one another stories are dangerous when they are ignored taken out of context are fiction masquerading as fact or used to dominate silence or demonise other people but stories have long been a means to explain what is happening to us to think through our fears and relate to each other as human beings this is the real power of stories in global health provision of comfort making sense of our health and place in the world challenging our preconceptions and defeating fear through stories of common humanitysevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov caused a pandemic with 800 deaths worldwide in only a few months 1 its genome was rapidly sequenced 2 and analysis of the identified predicted proteins is advancing bioinformatic analysis predicts that the sars-cov nonstructural protein 1 nsp1 is translated from the most 5 coding region of the sars-cov genome 2 3 4 it is predicted to be cleaved from a large viral polypeptide to form a mature peptide of 20 kda in agreement with recent reports 3 5 the conservation of a viral protein indicates its importance in the virus life cycle the nsp1 sequence is highly conserved in sars-cov isolates sequenced from humans civet cats and bats implying that it is crucial to replication of the virus survival in the host or spread in susceptible populations the full-length nsp1 protein is reported to be conserved in all 130 to date sars-cov isolates 4 in which the replicase proteins are predicted to be expressed therefore the nsp1 protein seems to be absolutely conserved in all replication-competent sars-cov virus isolateshere we discuss the sars-cov nsp1 protein from the following perspectives first bioinformatics analysis shows that it is a unique and highly conserved protein second biochemical studies by kamitani et al show the first functional data for nsp1 which implicate it in enhancing rna degradation 5 and third we discuss how nsp1 might contribute to the unique virulence of sars-covwhereas the sars-cov nonstructural proteins 316 are predicted to be conserved in both approximate size and sequence homology in all groups of coronaviruses 4 bioinformatics analyses show that the sars-cov nsp1 is a unique and novel sequence blastp e-value scores for nsp1 compared between sars-cov isolates are typically 1  1099 high percentage identity but after all sars-cov hits are considered only poor blast e values 085 remain which indicates that nsp1 has no significant similarity to any known sequences 6 the closest hits are to vertebrate not viral genes similarly blastn and tblastn showed no significant similarity score 013 and 13 between sars-cov nsp1 nucleotide sequence and any other nucleotide sequence in the ncbi databases coronavirus or non-coronavirus thus the sars-cov nsp1 is unique among coronaviruses 7 and could contribute to the exceptional pathogenesis of sars-cov in humans 1 although direct demonstration of an nsp1 effect on virulence is yet to be shown because there is no significant similarity to other genes a function for nsp1 cannot be inferred from knowledge of related gene functions similarly the nsp1 tertiary nmr structure 8 showed a novel fold ma johnson personal communication with no significant similarity to other proteins and thus the structure provided little insight into protein function finally motif analysis of sars-cov nsp1 showed that no significant protein functional motifs were present 9 10 these data all attest to the uniqueness of the sars-cov nsp1 protein and make it especially important and interesting to characterizerecently two groups have begun to characterize the sars-cov nsp1 protein showing that it is present in infected cells as a 20 kda protein as expected and demonstrating that the nsp1 protein is localized in the cytoplasm of infected or uninfected cells in which it is ectopically expressed 3 5 in an exciting turn of events it has now been reported that plasmid-driven expression of nsp1 causes a sharp reduction in the expression of proteins driven by promoters from simian virus 40 sv40 cytomegalovirus cmv and interferon ifn without necessarily affecting cell viability 5 further investigation indicated the specific mrna was also decreased whereas rrna remained unaffected transfected nsp1 rna capped and polyadenylated decreased host protein synthesis and the inclusion of actinomycin d to block new transcription showed a much stronger inhibition of protein synthesis in the presence of nsp1 this indicated that while translation of new transcripts was proceeding in cells not treated with actinomycin d translation from pre-existing transcripts was blocked by nsp1 5 this suggests but does not directly prove that nsp1 increases rna degradation decreased mrna levels and decreased translation of pre-existing mrna presumably as a result of degradation were also seen during infection with sars-cov together these data provide the first evidence of a function for the sars-cov nsp1 proteinthe mechanism of action of nsp1 remains mysterious it is possible that the observed effect of nsp1 protein on infected cells is caused by induction of a generalized stress response which causes host shut-off rather than specifically causing rna degradation for example cells transfected with nsp1 rna showed reduced viability 33 compared with cells transfected with chloramphenicol acetyl transferase rna 99 however it seems likely that degradation of rna would plausibly cause cell death evidence suggesting that the presence of nsp1 inside cells does not simply induce a non-specific host cell shutdown includes the following observations normal actin rna levels normal sendai virus n-protein expression and replication in nsp1-transfected cells stable rrna levels and finally the fact that 293 cells transfected with plasmid expressing nsp1 maintained 98 viability after 48 h 5among the possible hypotheses for nsp1 function are that nsp1 might i have nuclease activity either alone or as part of a complex with host proteins ii alter rna-interacting proteins or rna to make it more nuclease sensitive iii be required for the formation or activity of a cellular rnase or iv affect the localization of rna which could subsequently affect its stability andor degradation because there are no identifiable nucleotide-binding sites nuclease homologies or motifs 6 10 perhaps the latter mechanisms are more likely nsp1 has been localized intracellularly with other viral replication proteins 11 however the nsp1 effect on rna has been demonstrated in the absence of other viral proteins thus the functional significance of this association should be further studied furthermore the specificity of nsp1 remains to be elucidated if nsp1 decreases all rna viral and cellular is it still an advantage to the virus because viral transcription occurs at a much higher rate or is nsp1 somehow targeted to degrade cellular transcripts or even certain cell transcripts specifically the fact that it promotes degradation of several mrna sequences from different organisms but not rrna suggests some form of specificity however in some cases nsp1 does not decrease host protein levels appreciably and yet it seems to decrease even its own expression 5 certainly these questions will be the focus of future studiesvirus depression of host protein synthesis might give a competitive advantage to viral protein production and hence replication many viruses with both dna and rna genomes dampen host protein synthesis by various mechanisms 12 13 14 interestingly however not all of the identified genes that decrease host protein synthesis affect viral replication in vitro  in the case of the herpes virus vhs protein an effect is seen solely in virulence in vivo
14 these data suggest that at least in some cases the effects of host protein shut-off might not be competitive for protein production as much as subversive of the immune response for example a cell that is not expressing adequate levels of mhc class i or ii molecules will be impaired in its antigen presentation capacity both in initiating an adaptive immune response and in being targeted by it cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl killing figure 1
 indeed it has been shown that the herpes protein that causes rna degradation inhibits antigen presentation by dendritic cells 15 and directly decreases the specific immune response to the virus 16 additionally production of proinflammatory cytokines which alert the innate immune system to the presence of virus can also be blocked 17 the kinetics of the response also suggest involvement of the innate immune response because the presence of a gene that decreases host protein production can enhance viral replication in vivo before measurable adaptive immunity 14 because sars-cov is ifn-sensitive 18 19 nsp1 control of ifn might be crucial for sars-cov survival 5how sars-cov nsp1 functions remains to be answered removal of the nsp1 protein function from the virus 20 will enable determination of its effects on replication andor virulence in vivo however these experiments will require careful design and analysis because indiscriminate deletion of nsp1 sequence would remove cis-acting elements required for replication nsp1 effects on mhc expression antigen presentation cytokine production and ctl killing all need to be explored nsp1 could block induction of specific immunity by blocking host protein synthesis and antigen presentation or cytokine synthesis from sars-cov infected cells 21 22 23 or it could block presentation of viral peptides on infected cells thus masking and protecting infected cells from ctl killing determining this difference is essential to predicting sars-cov vaccine success if nsp1 blocks generation of specific immunity a well-designed sars-cov vaccine will circumvent this problem it is certainly possible to generate both good neutralizing antibody titer and t lymphocyte responses to sars-cov vaccines 24 however vaccination could be ineffective if cells harboring virus do not present viral peptides so that they can be recognized and eliminated by ctl killingevidence has been presented that sars-cov nsp1 a novel protein unique to sars-cov induces degradation of rna and diminishes subsequent protein synthesis similar to the reduction of rna seen in infected cells 5 this is an exciting step that will enable the field of sars-cov research to confirm and extend  or refute  these observations the specificity and biochemical mechanism of action is still to be elucidated as are the potential effects of the rna degradation on virulence and the immune response to sars-cov box 1
 creation of a virus with a functional nsp1 knockout 20 will enable direct demonstration of nsp1 effects on replication in vitro and virulence in animal models 1 24 these experiments will answer whether the sars-cov nsp1 is an important factor in the high virulence of sars-cov compared with related coronavirusesbox 1unanswered questions regarding sars-cov nsp1

as obligate intracellular parasites viruses depend on their host to replicate and spread viral tropism for specific cells tissues and hosts is determined by the presence and accessibility of host factors the virus needs to replicate the outcome of infection is also influenced by the ability of the host to mount an antiviral response to infection viruses differ in the specific host molecules used to infect cells and how they evade host immune pathways however general principles used by viruses to take over host cells are conserved viruses attach and enter cells cross the cellular lipid bilayer deliver viral nucleic acid to an intracellular site usurp cellular factors for replication and exit understanding the host and viral factors that promote or mitigate viral infection is essential for the development of efficacious antiviral therapeutics and the engineering of improved viral vectors for gene delivery and oncolytic purposesthe reoviridae are a family of non-enveloped double-stranded rna dsrna segmented viruses initially isolated from the stools of children in the 1950s 1 2 reovirus is an acronym for respiratory enteric orphan virus 3 members of the reoviridae include rotavirus the most common cause of pediatric gastroenteritis 4 bluetongue virus an economically important arthropod-transmitted virus that causes disease in ruminants 5 and mammalian orthoreovirus reovirus which infects humans although disease is restricted to the very young 3 6 serological studies have shown that most humans are exposed to reovirus during childhood with 35 of children under a year old and approximately 60 of children aged 1119 years being seropositive for reovirus antibodies 7 despite the presence of reovirus-specific antibodies the majority of reovirus infections in humans are asymptomatic reovirus-associated symptoms include coryza pharyngitis cough and gastroenteritis 8 9 and virus infection has been associated with neonatal biliary atresia 10 reovirus is also associated with the development of celiac disease by promoting loss of tolerance to dietary antigens 11 reovirus studies in mice have enhanced our understanding of how the virus disseminates from primary sites of replication 12 13 14 15 16 illustrate the importance of the innate and adaptive immune responses in controlling infection 1720 and revealed the importance of the gut microbiota in reovirus infection of the gastrointestinal tract 21the reovirus particle is 85 nm in diameter and is composed of two concentric capsid shells that contain 10 dsrna gene segments 22 23 reoviruses contain three large segments l1 l2 and l3 three medium segments m1 m2 and m3 and four small segments s1 s2 s3 and s4 that encode 11 viral proteins with the s1 gene segment encoding two viral proteins 3 three reovirus serotypes have been identified t1 t2 and t3 based on antibody-mediated neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition hai assays 3 four parental viruses isolated in the 1950s from human stool samples 2 type 1 lang t1l type 2 jones t2j type 3 abney t3a and type 3 dearing t3d are commonly used as parental strains a plasmid-based reverse genetics system for t1l and t3d reoviruses allows facile manipulation of their genome and has enabled studies to understand the contribution of specific viral components to reovirus biology 24in neonatal murine animal models reovirus infection via oral or respiratory routes results in primary infection of the gut or lungs followed by dissemination to secondary sites of replication 3 16 the brain heart liver and spleen all support viral replication and are sites of secondary viral replication 3 12 16 dissemination from the intestine occurs via neural and hematogenous routes depending on the viral strain 13 16 following oral inoculation t1l spreads via hematogenous routes infects ependymal cells in the brain and causes nonlethal hydrocephalus 15 t3d spreads via hematogenous and neural routes infects neurons and causes lethal encephalitis 13 15 16 these serotype-dependent differences in tropism are linked to the s1 gene segment-encoded 1 protein 25 26 viral-induced disease is limited to neonatal mice reovirus replication in the brains of 710-day-old mice is limited and these mice have decreased mortality reovirus infection of adult mice results in poor viral replication at primary sites of infection little dissemination to secondary sites and little to no mortality 27 28 adult mice with an impaired type i interferon response or those lacking b and t cells are susceptible to reovirus-induced disease suggesting that these components of the immune system are important to limit reovirus-induced pathogenesis in adult animals 18 29 30 in this review the focus is on how host and viral molecules interact during virus cell entry and how modulation of these steps affects the outcome of reovirus infectionthe process of reovirus cell entry involves attachment to target cells via a strength-adhesion mechanism whereby the virus attaches to cells by low-affinity interactions with cell-surface carbohydrate followed by strong-affinity interactions with cell-surface proteinaceous receptors virions are then internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis uncoated by endosomal proteases resulting in the release of the transcriptionally active viral core into the cytoplasm where viral nucleic acid is delivered successful viral entry requires an intricate interplay of host and viral factors host innate and adaptive antiviral factors target specific steps in the cell entry process to inhibit infection fig 1
reovirus attachment to cells occurs via interactions of the s1-encoded reovirus attachment fiber 1 to cell-surface carbohydrates 31 both t1 and t3 reoviruses bind sialic acid although they do so through different regions of the 1 protein 32 33 34 t1 reovirus agglutinates human and non-human primate erythrocytes whereas t3 reovirus agglutinates erythrocytes from various mammalian species 35 36 suggesting these serotypes engage different glycans glycan array screening revealed that t1 reovirus binds gm2 glycan whereas t3 reovirus binds various sialylated glycans 32 33 34 glycan binding by reovirus dictates viral tropism and spread in vivo t1 reovirus that is deficient in gm2 binding does not infect ependymal cells as efficiently and induces substantially less hydrocephalus in infected animals than wild-type reovirus 37 t3 reoviruses that are deficient on sialic acid binding are impaired in their ability to disseminate from the intestines to secondary sites of viral replication and replicate to lower titers in the spinal cord and brains of infected animals 38 39 monoclonal antibodies that neutralize t1 and t3 reovirus infection by binding sites on 1 also impair t1 and t3 hemagglutination of erythrocytes suggesting they impair t1 and t3 glycan binding 40 together these studies highlight the role of low affinity binding of cell-surface carbohydrates to reovirus infection and reovirus-mediated pathogenesis in small animal modelsfollowing attachment to carbohydrate reovirus engages a proteinaceous receptor junctional adhesion molecule-a jam-a 41 jam-a is an immunoglobulin superfamily protein that localizes mainly to cellular tight junctions 42 all three reovirus serotypes bind jam-a through the head domain of attachment fiber 1 and reovirus structural protein 2 affects the efficiency of the interaction between the virion and jam-a through an unknown mechanism 41 4345 also some rotavirus strains also use jam-a and other tight junction proteins as co-receptors for cell entry 46 whereas engagement of cell-surface carbohydrates is of low affinity binding to jam-a is of high affinity 44 jam-a binding does not mediate viral internalization as deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of jam-a which includes a pdz-binding domain that promotes binding of jam-a to scaffolding proteins within tight junctions is dispensable for reovirus infection 4749 it is not known how reovirus gains access to jam-a in tight junctions as reovirus infection does not appear to disrupt tight junction integrity during infection of polarized cells 50 this is in contrast to group b coxsackieviruses which enter cells by attaching to decay-accelerating factor daf on the apical surface promoting the disruption of tight junctions that allows virus access to the tight junction-resident coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor car 51 it is possible that reovirus engages pools of jam-a not found in tight junctions or is transported to tight junctions without substantial disruption of cellular barrier integritythe role of jam-a in reovirus infection in vivo has been determined through pan jam-a and tissue-specific jam-a knockout mice 12 14 although jam-a is necessary for reovirus dissemination from the intestines and reovirus-induced disease reovirus infection of the gastrointestinal tract is unaltered in jam-a knockout animals 12 14 intracranial inoculation of jam-a knockout animals does not affect virus replication in the central nervous system cns 12 the role of jam-a in reovirus dissemination to secondary sites of infection was defined through the use of endothelial-specific and hematogenous-specific jam-a knockout mice 14 eliminating jam-a expression from endothelial cells impaired reovirus dissemination from the gut in contrast lack of expression of jam-a in hematopoietic cells did not alter reovirus dissemination these data suggest that jam-a is not required for infection of the gut or cns but essential for reovirus dissemination from the gut into the bloodstream through reovirus infection of jam-a-expressing endothelial cellsduring reovirus infection of the gut the virus binds and is taken up by microfold m cells 52 53 interestingly during respiratory infection reovirus also uses m cells to gain access to the lungs 54 the virus does not actively replicate in m cells but transits through these cells and infects m cell-adjacent enterocytes through the basolateral surface 52 53 reovirus antigen is also detected in the villus tips of infected animals 12 13 although it is unclear if this represents primary infection or sites of replication after the virus has trafficked through intestinal m cells moreover the presence of host bacterial microbiota positively influences reovirus infection of the gut 21 although there is no direct evidence to show if jam-a expression is necessary for reovirus infection of specific sites within the gut the lack of an impairment on reovirus replication within the gastrointestinal tract in jam-a knockout animals strongly suggests that infection of intestinal cells is jam-a independent the identity of the cellular receptor that promotes reovirus infection of the gut is unknownreovirus infection of the cns is jam-a independent 12 through genome-wide rnai screening nogo receptor 1 ngr1 a glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi-anchored protein that is expressed on the cell surface of neurons was shown to mediate infection of primary murine cortical neurons as well as hela cells and chinese hamster ovary cho cells 55 expression of ngr1 in trans enhances reovirus attachment to cells and ngr1-specific antibodies impair reovirus attachment and infectivity of cho cells reovirus infection of primary murine cortical neurons lacking ngr1 and infection in the presence of ngr1-specific antibodies is severely impaired suggesting that ngr1 is key for productive infection of neurons interestingly in vitro-generated infectious subvirion particles isvps that lack the 3 structural protein but contain the 1 attachment fiber are unable to infect ngr1-expressing cho cells these data indicate that ngr1 mediates reovirus infection of a subset of cells in the cns and that engagement of ngr1 by reovirus occurs either through the 3 structural protein or a specific conformation of the 1 attachment fiber found in virions ngr1 expression in the cns mirror sites that are susceptible to t3 reovirus infection including the thalamus middle and outer layers of the cerebral cortex the ca3 region of the hippocampus and cerebellar purkinje cells 12 56 whether ngr1 is essential for infection of the cns in vivo how it affects reovirus pathogenesis by t1 and t3 reoviruses and how it affects reovirus infection at other sites besides the cns remain to be determinedfollowing attachment to cell-surface carbohydrate jam-a and ngr1 reovirus is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis endocytosis in some cells is dependent on 1 integrin 48 57 although it is unclear if the virus directly or indirectly engages 1 integrin or if the virus utilizes signaling from 1 integrin to promote endocytosis the viral core protein 2 has conserved rgd and kge integrin-binding motifs that are solvent exposed in the virion 56 58 however it is not known if these motifs mediate direct interaction with 1 integrin or if they have another function during reovirus infection although the cytoplasmic tail of jam-a is dispensable for reovirus internalization 47 npxy motifs found in the cytoplasmic tail of 1 integrin are necessary for efficient infection and internalization 57 npxy motifs have been shown to mediate the association of 1 integrin with the actin cytoskeleton and regulate integrin signaling 59 several rotavirus strains use integrins to infect cells 60 suggesting a conserved mechanism exploited by the reoviridae the exact signaling events and molecules recruited to the site of viral entry triggered by the engagement of integrins by reovirus are not well definedreovirus endocytosis is primarily dependent on clathrin 57 61 however there is mounting evidence that other mechanisms are involved in the cellular uptake of the virus including dynamin-dependent and dynamin-independent mechanisms 57 62 following internalization the virus is transported through rab5-positive early endosomes to rab7- and rab9-positive late endosomes where cathepsin proteases perform acid-dependent proteolysis of the viral particle 6367 jam-a is observed in the same endosomal compartments as reovirus during cell entry 67 viral particles are also observed in slow and fast recycling compartments but impairment of these compartments does not diminish reovirus infectivity 67 it is unclear if virus present in recycling compartments is recycled to the cell surface where it may re-initiate cell entry or if this compartment is a non-productive cell entry route it is possible that virions that end up in the recycling compartment define a subset of viral particles that failed to induce the necessary molecules or signaling events needed for productive cell entrydifferent reovirus particle types use distinct endocytic entry routes which affect the fate of the infected cell whereas virions must traverse through early and late endosomes to productively infect cells in vitro-generated isvps enter cells by engaging cell-surface carbohydrate and jam-a followed by receptor mediated endocytosis and transport to early but not late endosomes 41 62 66 68 during the natural course of infection isvps are generated during the endocytic transport of virions through the endosomal system by cathepsin cleavage of the viral particle presumably in late endosomes 64 69 as isvps have been proteolytically digested infection with extracellularly-produced isvps is able to bypass the need for cathepsin-mediated digestion of the virion to promote membrane penetration in vivo isvps are generated in the intestinal lumen by resident proteases and are thought to be the type of viral particle that enters m cells in the gut 70 in intestinal epithelial cells the alternate endocytic transport route taken by isvps yields a dampened innate immune response and induction of a pro-survival state through tgf- production 71 in contrast infection of intestinal epithelial cells with virions strongly activates the innate immune response and results in significant levels of cell death 71 these data indicate that the route of infection can greatly affect not only the fate of the incoming virion but also the ultimate outcome of infection it remains to be determined if isvps infect other cells beyond those in the gut during in vivo infection and whether pro-survival pathways are induced following reovirus infection of the intestinesengagement of several host factors beyond cell-surface carbohydrate jam-a ngr1 and 1 integrin are important for efficient reovirus cell entry src kinase the prototype member of the src family of kinases is activated and colocalizes with reovirus virions during cell entry 72 infection in the presence of a src kinase inhibitor or infection of cells that are devoid of src kinase results in the aberrant transport of reovirus to lysosomes 72 the activation of src family kinases is also used by coxsackievirus b following engagement of daf 51 suggesting this is a conserved mechanism used by viruses to productively enter cells in the context of coxsackievirus infection fyn kinase activation promotes actin rearrangement that is needed for the transport of virions to tight junctions and subsequent internalization by caveolin-mediated endocytosis 51 in contrast to coxsackievirus src activity does not affect the overall internalization of reovirus how reovirus activates src and the downstream factors modified by src that promote reovirus infection are not knownother molecules that modulate reovirus infection at the cell entry step include serotonin receptors 5-htr and the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 ifitm3 73 74 inducing 5-htr signaling with the agonist 5-nonyloxytrymptamine 5-nt impairs reovirus infection whereas antagonizing 5-htrs enhance infectivity 74 treatment of cells with 5-nt impairs reovirus infection by affecting cell entry kinetics through disruption of early endosome localization 74 the effect of 5-nt is not reovirus specific as infection with the alphavirus chikungunya virus and the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus mhv both of which use early endosomes to enter cells was impaired by 5-nt 43 75 76 the interferon-inducible ifitm3 which localizes to late endosomes restricts infection of reovirus virions but not isvps 73 ifitm family of proteins has been shown to restrict infection of coronaviruses filoviruses and influenza virus at a step involving late endosomes 77 78 as such the late endosomal compartment appears to be a bottleneck where the host has evolved mechanisms to antagonize virus infection by a variety of virusesreovirus access to the late endosomal compartment results in the proteolytic disassembly of virions by cathepsins b l and s 63 65 79 80 cathepsin proteolysis is also used during ebola virus entry 81 82 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov utilizes cathepsins to process its glycoprotein prior to fusion with the cell membrane 83 84 cathepsin cleavage in late endosomes give rise to isvps which are characterized by the loss of the outer capsid protein 3 conformational changes in 1 and cleavage of the major capsid protein 1 3 although the low ph environment of the late endosome is essential for cathepsin activity 69 artificially lowering endosomal ph is detrimental to reovirus infection 85 these data suggest that reovirus disassembly kinetics are perfectly orchestrated to use both the lower ph environment of late endosomes and the proteolytic activity of cathepsins cleavage of the 1 protein releases an n-terminally myristoylated fragment that associates with cellular membranes and is capable of pore formation 86 87 the interaction of the 1 cleavage fragment with lipid membranes not only drives pore formation but also affects the disassembly of the viral particle 88 89 besides cathepsins the cellular chaperone hsp70 participates in reovirus cell entry by removing residual 1 fragments from virions 90 it is unclear if hsp70 activity also promotes the transport of the virion across the endosomal membrane the cell entry process culminates with endosomal membrane penetration by a transcriptionally active viral core that delivers viral transcripts in the cytoplasm of host cells 3studies on reovirus cell entry have shown an intricate process used by the virus to attach to host cells trigger endocytic events that culminate with membrane penetration by the viral particle and release of viral nucleic acid into the cytoplasm of cells it is revealing that a variety of viruses from reovirus to coronaviruses picornaviruses and filoviruses have evolved to use similar molecular mechanisms to gain entry into their host this highlights the importance of studies of host and pathogen interactions as they are likely to illuminate mechanisms used by several viruses and provide valuable insights for the development of antiviral therapeuticsan antibody also called an immunoglobulin is a protective protein produced by the immune system in response to the presence of a foreign substance antigen such as a pathogen antibodies recognize and latch onto antigens in order to remove them from the body antibodies are proteins produced and secreted by b cells lymphocytes 17because a principal function of b lymphocytes is antibody production it is important to understand the salient features of these defense molecules and describe their different isotypes or classes antibodies are glycosylated protein molecules present on the surface of b cells surface immunoglobulins serving as antigen receptors bcr or are secreted into the extracellular space where they can bind and neutralize their target antigens 17 a single antibody molecule consists of four protein chains two heavy h chains and two light l chains linked to each other by disulfide bonds the n-terminus regions of the heavy and light chains which collectively make up the antigen-binding site are where the variability between one antibody molecule and another resides hence determining specificity an important feature is that each antibody recognizes a specific antigen a phenomenon called antibody specificity for example an antibody that recognizes the mumps virus cannot recognize the measles virus and can only recognize one particular binding site on the mumps virus there will likely be multiple antibodies to multiple different binding sites on an antigen such as a virus for example some antibodies to covid-19 will target binding sites on proteins in the outer shell while some may target nucleic acid binding sites but each will be specific and unique only when two different but similar viruses have identical structures will cross-reactivity occur for example if multiple strains of a coronavirus have maintained regions of nucleic acid that have not undergone mutation an antibody that targets that region in one may target the identical region in another conversely an antibody that recognizes the measles virus generally cannot recognize the mumps virusfive isotypes or classes of antibodies igm igd igg iga and ige exist and they are distinguished according to the c-terminus regions of the heavy chains which are constant and therefore do not participate in antigen binding instead these regions designated fc are important for the common effector functions of antibodies the means by which antibodies eliminate pathogens or alternatively cause tissue injury it should be noted that there are four subclasses or isotypes of igg antibodies igg1 igg2 igg3 and igg4 the distinction of which is beyond the scope of this discussion antibodies exert effector functions in three principal ways 17antibodies are found in plasma and in extracellular fluid antibodies have three primary functions1antibodies are secreted into the blood and mucosa where they bind to and inactivate foreign substances such as pathogens and toxins neutralization antibody neutralization is important for protection from viruses as it can prevent the virus from then being able to enter and infect cells it is also important in binding to bacterial toxins and is the primary mechanism for protection conferred by successful vaccination2antibodies facilitate phagocytosis of foreign substances by phagocytic cells opsonization antibody binding for example will not prevent bacterial replication rather in this setting the mechanism of enhanced protection through opsonization will increase phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils3the third function is antibody activation of the complement system to destroy pathogens through lysis and enhanced chemotaxis
after an infection the cells producing pathogen-specific antibodies multiply and increase proportionally as a result the body is protected from repeated infection this feature is called immunological memory one of the most significant features of the immune response is its ability to retain a memory of previous infections and this is also the principal behind the effectiveness of vaccinations this both protects individuals from reinfection and limits the spread of infection in a community immune memory can be very long-lasting immunological memory for the measles infection in adults decays so slowly it would take over 3000 years to decrease by half this therefore goes well beyond life-long protection for this particular antigen these robust durable changes are the reason that when we vaccinate the protection this produces delivers long-term benefits within an individual immune memory must be distributed throughout the body circulating antibodies travel in the blood reaching everywhere the circulation does including extracellular spaces and in secretions natural killer nk cells can remain on guard within tissues alert but not activated ready to attack rapidly if reinfection occurs nk cells are activated in response to macrophage-derived cytokines and they serve to contain viral infections while the adaptive immune response generates antigen-specific cytotoxic t cells that can clear the infection nk cells work to control viral infections by secreting interferon gamma and tnf while also stimulating nk cells nearby with such secretions and destroying physiologically challenged cells due to viral infection or malignancy through complex mechanisms outside the scope of this reviewfinally some infections have such a profound impact on a species that the imprint of individual pathogens can be seen in the tree of evolution if an infection is lethal only individuals who have genes that encode effective resistance will survive to produce the next generation thereby driving herd immunity through natural selection rather than vaccination or infection modern methods of analyzing inheritance have demonstrated how the co-evolution of host and infection has shaped the make-up of the immune system and the receptors it uses for recognizing and fighting pathogensigg is the most abundant antibody isotype in the blood plasma accounting for 70 to 75 of human immunoglobulins antibodies igg binds antigen and drives the recognition of antigen-antibody complexes by leukocytes and macrophages igg is transferred to the fetus through the placenta and protects the infant until its own immune system is functional igg is largely responsible for long term immunity after infection or vaccinationigm usually circulates in the blood accounting for about 10 of human immunoglobulins igm generally has a pentameric structure in which five basic y-shaped molecules are linked together b cells produce igm first in response to microbial infectionantigen invasion these are early phase immunoglobulins that will develop first during acute infection although igm has a lower affinity for antigens than igg it has higher avidity for antigens because of its pentameric structure igm by binding to the cell surface receptor also activates cell signaling pathwaysiga is abundant in serum nasal mucus saliva breast milk and intestinal fluid accounting for 10 to 15 of human immunoglobulins iga forms dimers ie two iga monomers joined togetherige is present in minute amounts accounting for no more than 0001 of human immunoglobulins its primary role is to protect against parasites in regions where parasitic infection is rare ige is primarily involved in allergyigd accounts for less than 1 of human immunoglobulins igd may be involved in the induction of antibody production in b cells but its exact function remains unknownmolecular test methods are considered the only reliable means of diagnosing an active case of covid-19 particularly early in the infection course and is the only means of determining if a patient is contagious to others by detecting the presence of viral genetic material in the nasal oral and respiratory tracts one can determine if a patient is actively shedding virus which can be spread to others these tests are perhaps of greatest utility early in the course of infection as they can confirm viral presence up to 2 days prior to the onset of symptoms given that antibodies may not be detectable until 6-7 days after symptom onset molecular tests can accelerate the diagnostic window by up to 9 days the duration of viral shedding can be highly variable and depend upon severity of symptoms length of illness and patient-specific immune response generally speaking viral shedding is undetectable 21 to 35 days after symptom onset or 3 to 5 days after a patient becomes asymptomatic at the end of the disease course viral load ultimately becomes undetectable and therefore a molecular test will not detect a prior infection even one that has recently resolved while point of care molecular tests for sars-cov-2 are becoming more widely available with faster result times all currently available tests require a laboratory analyzer platform which are generally in short supply and on back order for several months there remains a backlog of samples for molecular testing at many labs and public health officials have put in place strict guidelines requiring severe symptoms in order to qualify to receive a molecular testtherefore there is a clear role for antibody testing as an important tool in the diagnostic toolbox for covid-19 antibody testing can provide important insight to individuals about their functional immunity to the ongoing pandemic giving piece of mind and assisting with decisions about return to community activities and the workplace these tests also provide valuable information to public health officials about the spread of virus in different communities especially in light of the high reported numbers of asymptomatic cases furthermore while never a primary diagnostic tool antibody status can be used to aid the clinical diagnosis of suspected non-critical cases that present 7 days or more after the start of symptoms in these cases the use of simple cost effective point of care antibody cassette systems can offload the pressure on molecular testing throughput to make those resources more immediately available to the acutely ill and critical patientswith the rapid acceleration of the covid-19 pandemic there has been a rush to develop tests that can detect the presence of antibodies produced by the body in response to exposureinfection with the sars-cov-2 virus these testing methodologies rely on the antigen-antibody binding affinity described above the test principle relies on a recombinant antigen produced in the laboratory which is designed to mimic specific structures of the virus causing any antibodies present in whole blood or serum with a binding affinity to attach to the antigen the specificity of the test can be highly dependent upon the target antigen that is chosen as some viral structures can be highly conserved across broad families of virus and others can be highly derived and specific to a given strain therefore it is important to understand the cross reactivity to other viruses of the test being used so as to avoid misinterpretation of a false positive result that may be detecting an antigen from a similar virus yet not confer immunity to the sars-cov-2 virus these tests fall into two broad categories laboratory-based immunoassays which require a reader or analyzer to detect the reaction and cassette-based systems which can be read at the point of care through a change in color in an indicator region visible to the naked eyelaboratory-based immunoassays have several technical advantages when compared to cassette-based systems because they are read by sensitive laboratory instrumentation and a controlled aliquot is delivered to the test system they can be considered quantitative or semi-quantitative tests therefore they can determine how much of a given antibody titer level is present per unit volume of serum and when operating at the margins of detection their sensitivity and specificity can be higher than cassette-based systems however these systems have real disadvantages infrastructure costs requirements for venous puncture additional steps in sample processing time to obtain results and practical through put challenges are problematic and substantially increase cost per testcassette-based systems rely on a color change that is visible to the human eye and is more appropriate for use at the point of care with almost immediate results available to healthcare workers and patients cassette systems use the principle of lateral flow immunoassay or immunochromatography the cassette contains a shallow well into which approximately 10 to 15ul eg two small drops from a finger prick of whole blood serum or plasma are placed along with a small quantity of buffer specific to the test kit the blood and buffer are absorbed into a porous test strip which is impregnated with recombinant viral antigens doped with an indicator eg colloidal gold latex particles europium or quantum dots antibodies from the serum bind to antigens in the test strip and are wicked laterally along the length of the test strip in the indicator regions of the test kit anti-human antibodies which are immobilized in the test strip will bind to the antigen-antibody complex and hold them in the indicator region the colloidal gold or other colorant accumulates in the indicator region leading to a visible change in color along a narrow band of the wicking substrate there may be one or more indicator regions with anti-human antibodies that are specific to igm igg or other immunoglobulins all tests should also contain a control indicator line to confirm that the test sample has appropriately wicked along the length of the assay and antigens in the test kit remain viable therefore confirming a valid test procedure figure 1
 this entire process from finger-stick to result occurs in less than 15 minutesthese points of care test cassettes are intended to be read as a binary outcome presenceabsence for each antibody indicator region while the degree of color change may be an indicator of the quantity of antibody present in a sample variability between antibody concentrations in whole blood plasma and serum along with a buffer that is added in drops make it unreliable to attempt interpretation of color change intensity with most currently available technology kits that use fluorescent indicators can provide semiquantitative results with a hand-held or tabletop reader and appropriate sample preparation techniques but cannot be read by eye the advantages of lateral flow immunoassay kits are that they can be produced at low cost and in large quantities they can be used point of care with finger-stick whole blood samples require low human and facility resource utilization and can provide very rapid test results  while a patient remains on site this makes lateral flow immunoassay cassettes an ideal choice for population level sampling and workforce sampling for small and large employers as discussed further belowsince most test kits contain indicator lines for both igm and igg antibodies there are several different combinations and corresponding interpretations of results that may occur results themselves should always be interpreted in accordance with the package insert and instructions for use with the specific test kit being utilized but the following discussion is helpful in linking the binary results of the typical antibody test to clinical meaning and making informed recommendations for patients and the workforce as discussed earlier igm antibodies are produced in the short term after infection while igg are produced in a more delayed timescale the use of both is advantageous 18 19 20 in a recent study of 535 plasma samples taken from 173 patients with sars-cov-2 the median seroconversion time for total antibody ab igm and then igg were day-11 day-12 and day-14 separately the presence of antibodies was 40 among patients within 1-week since onset and rapidly increased to 1000 ab 943 igm and 798 igg 15 days after onset in contrast rna detectability decreased from 667 in samples collected before day-7 to 455 during day 15-39 combining rna and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for covid-19 p0001 even in early phase of 1-week since onset p0007 moreover a higher titer of ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification p0006 consistent with the understanding that more symptomatic patients are likely to have higher antibody responses and higher inflammatory markers on average using the sars coronavirus as an example igm antibodies generally rise above the detectable threshold for these point of care tests in approximately 5 to 7 days after the initial onset of symptoms assuming a patient does develop symptoms after infection the igm then remains above the detection threshold for 14 to 21 days from symptom onset about midway through the rise and fall of igm production around day 14 post-symptom onset igg will rise above detection levels igg production will generally continue to rise for 28 to 35 post symptom onset peaking around or after clinical recovery igg typically has a long half-life and will remain above detectable thresholds for months or even years after the resolution of infectionthe clinical level of functional immunity imparted by sars-cov-2 igg antibodies and their critical concentration cutoffs have not been determined for this virus therefore recommendations must be based on similar viruses and knowledge of the immune system ultimately this information will be available and quantitative tests will be valuable in determining immunity titers months and years after covid-19 infection or vaccination once vaccines exist based on experience with other viruses if reinfection does occur with the same pathogen one would expect symptom severity and duration to be greatly reduced due to the inherent memory of the immune system further the hyperimmune response that leads to ards and which is associated with the high mortality rate of this virus would expect to be mitigated by the presence of a prior immune responsefor the interpretation of results in an effort to make meaningful recommendations on community behavior to test recipients there are several factors that must be considered1is subject symptomatic or asymptomatic at the time of antibody testing2if symptomatic how long since symptom onset3igm positive or negative4igg positive or negative
interpreting results when subject is asymptomatic at the time of testing
both igm and igg are negative

figure 1
 left image subjects immune system has not produced any antibodies to the target viral antigen and is not suspected of having covid-19 it is not likely the subject has had the infection in the past and the subject is not immune to getting the infection in the future this result does not rule out that the subject was recently exposed to the virus and is not yet producing antibodies a subject that was recently exposed to the virus could spread the disease even if this test is negative and they are asymptomatic as long as the virus is spreading in the community the subject should continue to practice social distancing or current guidelines to protect themselves and those around them if the subject does develop symptoms they should seek medical care and repeat testing based on future potential exposure or symptoms
igg is positive and igm is negative

figure 2

 the subjects immune system has produced longer acting antibodies to the target viral antigen subject likely had the infection several weeks ago even if no symptoms were present the subject has some degree of functional immunity to the virus depending upon the time that has passed since exposure it is unlikely that the subject is spreading virus a molecular test may be used to rule out viral shedding as discussed in greater detail in the next section
igm is positive and igg is negative

figure 3
 this test result indicates that the immune system is actively producing antibodies to a recent infection the subject should immediately isolate from healthy individuals and seek further medical advice if symptoms develop this subject can likely spread disease to others even when asymptomatic subject may remain symptom free experience minor symptoms or worsening symptoms as the disease course progresses subject should be vigilant and seek care appropriate to the symptoms they experience after at least 14 to 21 days the subject should consider repeat testing to confirm their igg antibody status has become positive and they are outside the expected window to shed virus before returning to normal activities if more rapid return to community activities is warranted eg for critical industry workers a molecular test should be performed to assess viral shedding status
both igm and igg are positive

figure 4
 subjects immune system is actively producing antibodies to an ongoing infection that likely began more than 14 days ago subject should immediate isolate from healthy individuals and seek further medical advice if symptoms develop subject is likely experiencing an asymptomatic disease course but may still be able to spread the disease to others consider repeat testing in 7 to 14 days to confirm igg only status before returning to normal activities if more rapid return to community activities is warranted eg for critical industry workers a molecular test should be performed to assess viral shedding statusinterpreting results when symptomatic at the time of testing
both igm and igg are negative subjects immune system has not produced any antibodies to the target viral antigen if it has been greater than 7 days since onset of fever or other symptoms the disease is unlikely to be covid-19 but a full panel test including covid-19 influenza and bacterial bronchitis could be performed if available and recommended based on history and symptoms if it has been less than 7 days since the onset of symptoms covid-19 cannot be ruled out with antibody testing alone subject should isolate from others and could repeat antibody testing at least 7 days after the onset of symptoms unless a molecular test was available for confirmation if symptoms are severe and covid-19 is suspected based on clinical signs a molecular test is indicated for the detection of viral genetic material in respiratory samples subject should not return to normal activities until sars-cov-2 infection is ruled out through alternate diagnoses molecular testing or repeat antibody testing or appropriate time has elapsed after symptom development to rule out ongoing viral shedding shedding can occur up to approximately 31 days from exposure
igg is positive and igm is negative subjects immune system has produced antibodies to the target viral antigen subject is likely in the later stages of the disease course but may still be contagious to others and capable of spreading the virus subject should remain isolated from disease negative population for at least 14 days to minimize the chance of spreading the virus if more rapid return to community activities is warranted eg for critical industry workers a molecular test should be performed to assess viral shedding status
igm is positive and igg is negative subjects immune system is actively producing antibodies to a recent infection with the target virus subject should immediately isolate from healthy individuals and seek medical care appropriate to the symptom severity they experience subject can spread the disease to others at this point in disease course after at least 14 to 21 days subject should consider repeat testing to determine igg status before returning to normal activities
both igm and igg are positive subjects immune system is actively producing antibodies to an ongoing infection that likely began more than 14 days ago subject should immediately isolate from healthy individuals and seek further medical care appropriate to the symptom severity they experience subject can likely still spread the disease to others consider repeat testing in 7 to 14 days to confirm igg only status before returning to normal activities if more rapid return to community activities is warranted eg for critical industry workers a molecular test should be performed to assess viral shedding statusas outlined above regardless of the testing methodology employed to detect antibodies these tests are not intended to be used a means to diagnose an active infection this is primarily because 1 there is a temporal lag between exposure to the virus and the development of antibodies by the immune system and 2 antibodies will persist long after the body has cleared an infection these tests are an excellent tool to be used in parallel with molecular testing patient history and clinical presentation in symptomatic patients or used in asymptomatic patients over a period of time to understand return to activity recommendations the temporal framework related to exposure onset of symptoms production of igm and igg symptom resolution and virus shedding throughout the course of disease have not been well quantified for sars-cov-2 specifically at this time most of the data and recommendations have been extrapolated from the studies done on the first sars outbreak in the early 21st century it is also important to understand that molecular testing is imperfect as well with up to 30 false negative rates in some series therefore when looking at the sensitivity and specificity of antibody testing one must be academic enough to recognize the inherent weaknesses of using such a test to evaluate another test it will be hard to know whether a positive antibody test in a patient with a negative molecular test means the former test is a false positive or the latter was a false negative physicians must truly diligence these products and be satisfied with the data as well as the track record of the company marketing it we expect a lot more information to be forthcoming in the peer-reviewed literature over the next 6 to 18 months which will improve the interpretation and utility of antibody testsa study in the wake of sars the similar coronavirus that triggered an epidemic in 2003 showed that survivors maintained neutralizing antibodies for two years on average with the number of antibodies declining thereafter other coronaviruses in circulation in the human species also lead to at least partial immunity for some period of time the immunity question has implications for whether covid-19 follows an annual cycle like seasonal influenza or becomes dormant for multiple years and then erupts again according to a recent publication in the journal science the authors noted that two other coronaviruses in circulation oc43 and hku1 which cause common colds result in about 45 weeks of immunity on average if the new virus follows that pattern it would probably create annual outbreaks they found 21 however generally speaking the sicker you become due to an infection and the robust immune system response to it the more robust the immunity provided therefore one might assume that those people who get the most ill have the longest and most effective immunity after a re-exposure to the same virus in a study by callow et al 22 people volunteered to have coronavirus 229e which also causes common cold symptoms inoculated up their nares ten became infected and eight developed cold symptoms one year later all but one of them returned to be re-infected again the majority were re-infected but those who had been ill before did not develop cold symptoms moreover the period during which the patients shed the virus and were potentially contagious was shorter the new virus sars-cov-2 is genetically similar to the first sars virus  hence the 2  but it affects people differently it is not as lethal as the original sars but is more easily spread ro is higher 23 many people who are infected do not develop symptoms at all and yet can potentially transmit the virus to othersa very recent report from china that has not yet been peer-reviewed found a wide range of antibodies among people with mild cases of the virus most strikingly younger people had fewer antibodies in the wake of the disease  and 30 percent of those sampled had low levels some individuals had no trace of antibodies that has raised the question of whether a person with a mild or asymptomatic infection but confirmed by the sensitive pcr test might still be susceptible to a second infection the neutralizing antibody titers were positively correlated with plasma crp levels but negatively correlated with the lymphocyte counts of patients at the time of admission indicating an association between degree of humoral response and cellular immune response however those with mild disease who do not develop high levels of antibodies may be at increased risk of re-infection but are not likely to get significant symptoms although the may be contagious therefore those without antibody production should likely be treated as if they never had the disease from a social distancing perspective even if they were proven to be positive with molecular testinglongitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to sars-cov-2 it will undoubtedly take time for this data to become available despite the hyperbolic media coverage regarding antibody testing initially positive and then a week later somewhat negative physicians must continue to do what we have always done we must accept that data especially early data is rarely complete or perfect and we must utilize the existing body of knowledge to make evidence-based decisions we believe that there exists a real value in antibody testing when performed properly with quality devices and a good understanding of how to interpret the clinical meaning of the results such testing can help educate decisions regarding social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment and can help risk stratify essential work force members as physicians we know that there is no perfect test and it behooves us all to make certain that we utilize as many data points as possible while trying to safely recover from both this pandemic and the possible secondary spikes in covid-19 incidence that may appear prior to widespread vaccinationnone of the authors have any conflicts to reportthis paper considers the ways in which the coronavirus covid19 pandemic of 2020 is influencing the geopolitics of kalaallit nunaat in english greenland a highly autonomous subnational island jurisdiction snij of denmark we focus on how the pandemic has influenced both kalaallit nunaats relationship with the outside world and relations between people and places within the territory this sheds light on the geopolitical impacts of disease in island communities more generallythe first case of covid19 in kalaallit nunaat was confirmed on 16 march 2020 at the time of writing 20 april 2020 kalaallit nunaat is the worlds only country or autonomous territory to have transitioned from confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus to no active cases this paper is a piece of research in realtime written on 313 april 2020 with minor revisions undertaken over the subsequent week and a half as events are still unfolding and policies are still developing in both kalaallit nunaat and denmark our research is thus a snapshot in time sacrificing the benefit of hindsight for the ability to describe and analyse transformative events while immersed in their provisionalitynext we discuss perceived links between islands geopolitics and infectious disease and then describe our methods we then provide an overview of kalaallit nunaats development from a colonised archipelago to an autonomous snij before describing the development of kalaallit nunaats discursive and policy approach to the covid19 pandemic we consider the geopolitical impacts of the pandemic before offering a short conclusionagnew 2003 p 5 defines geopolitics as an examination of the geographical assumptions designations and understandings that enter into the making of world politics islands are often regarded as geopolitical hotspots mountz 2015 ratter 2018 border islands

2020 all this plays a role in the manner in which islands and archipelagos have been envisioned claimed exploited and reclaimed within coloniality gmezbarris  joseph 2019although the geopolitics of disease ingram 2009 are not exclusive to islands the fact that island geography is linked with particular patterns of centreperiphery power relations including colonial relations suggests that an island perspective on this topic may be worthwhile the association of islands with territorial boundedness and isolation has contributed to their use as convenient laboratories for studying disease eg mantle  pepys 1974 cliff  haggett 1980 however the effect of islandness on prevalence of disease is complex common methods of managing epidemics include quarantining suspected or confirmed cases and close contacts implementing information campaigns to provide the public with resources and advice on prevention and protection and restricting and controlling travel mccloskey  heymann 2020 wu  mcgoogan 2020 yang et al
2020 islands may be regarded as possessing geographical advantages in the execution of these methods due to their perceived isolation and their accompanying ability to control mobility and draw upon strong social capital baldacchino 2005nevertheless the history of epidemics and pandemics suggests that as is true more generally even apparently isolated islands exist on a continuum of different degrees of isolation and connectedness baldacchino 2008 lewis 2009 grydehj  casagrande 2020 bridges tunnels causeways airports and highspeed ferries are increasingly connecting islands physically karampela et al

2012the novel coronavirus causing covid19 was first identified in china at the end of 2019 and led to the 2020 pandemic on 13 january 2020 thailand reported the first case outside of china followed by the archipelagic country of japan on 16 january the disease has since spread to nearly all countries and territories around the world china has mainly approached the disease using traditional tactics such as isolation quarantine physical distancing of people community containment and travel restrictions these methods were introduced to china by dr wu liande regarded as the founder of chinas public health system to suppress the 1910 pneumonic plague outbreak in northeastern china ma  li 2016 for covid19 the chinese government initiated a strict lockdown of wuhan the city at the epicentre of the outbreak on 23 january 2020 suspending all internal and external transport for over two months a few days later hubei province as a whole was locked down and virtually all transportation was restricted and monitored at a national level these restrictions have proven effective at mitigating the spread of covid19 in china chinazzi et al
2020 macintyre 2020 with the main danger currently being reintroduction of the virus from other countriesas covid19 spread worldwide many countries sought to balance epidemiological impact namely in mortality and economic losses the kalaallit nunaat governments approach to managing this highly contagious disease has been quite similar to chinas notwithstanding the tremendous differences between kalaallit nunaat and china in terms of geography population size culture and political system it is thus worth asking whether island status really does have any particular effect on the presence and prevalence of infectious disease while it could be argued that island isolation slows the arrival of coronavirus it would be premature to conclude that islands are generally safer from infection than nonislands what is more interesting for this paper is how island geopolitics affect and are affected by infectious diseasethe fact that we have undertaken this research and written this paper in the midst of events presents a number of challenges one challenge is that our literature search found no existing published scholarly research on the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on kalaallit nunaat a circumstance that highlights the novelty of the study but that also means we are building this research from scratch the only material available at the time of writing concerned impacts across countries including greenland eg crawford et al
2020 and nonpeer reviewed preprints eg chipperfield et al
2020 another challenge is that with the situation on the ground rapidly developing over the course of our research we are unable to obtain a perspective of distance or to do more than surmise at the pandemics longterm impacts in kalaallit nunaat as such this manuscript presents a snapshot of the situation in early april 2020we must use the means of data collection available within the context of most countries being locked down by travel bans we thus rely here on a qualitative analysis of a combination of i unsystematically sampled newspaper articles ii a complete sample of articles present in the coronavirus theme section of the online version of sermitsiaq the largest kalaallit nunaat newspaper and a bilingual danishkalaallisut language publication between 27 january 2020 and 7 april 2020 n  363 iii social media posts on the online version of sermitsiaq and in individual and group facebook pages and iv personal written correspondence with seven kalaallit nunaat contacts of this papers first author from 16 april 2020 this correspondence was provided following the acquisition of informed written consent and all quoted correspondents declined an offer of anonymitythe sample of individuals who engaged in written correspondence was not representative the sample included five residents of nuuk and two individuals living in copenhagen who together were six individuals of inuit ethnicity and one ethnic dane all seven respondents have university education ages varied from 28 to 56 and there were three women and four menbecause none of the authors speak or read the kalaallisut language we relied on information available in danish or english kalaallit nunaats second and third languages respectively among ethnic inuit knowledge of danish is associated with higher educational and socioeconomic status while knowledge of kalaallisut among ethnic danes is rare leading to differential opportunities for different social groups gad 2019 this results in a situation in which much official information media output and other material is produced in danish then translated into kalaallisut villadsen 2016finally it is especially important to be aware of ones positionality  ones place within the system of coloniality  when researching colonised societies grydehj 2018 the authors are a multinational group of scholars the first author who grew up in the usa and now lives in copenhagen studies the intersection of culture politics and economy in island communities and has undertaken ethnographic research in nuuk the second author grew up in canada but lives in the uk after moving there from norway and is a disaster and health researcher focusing on islands and the polar regions the third author grew up in china and lives in guangzhou her research focus is the construction of community among ethnic minorities the first and second authors collaborate on research concerning conceptions of island sustainability and the first and third authors collaborate on research concerning islands and coloniality both these research collaborations have involved work concerning kalaallit nunaats relationship with denmarkkalaallit nunaat is often called the worlds largest island 2166086 km2 but it is in fact an archipelago consisting of a large island ringed by numerous smaller islands this arctic territorys 56000 residents are spread throughout 74 coastal towns and settlements there are no road connections between towns and settlements which are instead linked by air aeroplane helicopter maritime ferry small boat with outboard motor and snowborne dogsled snowmobile transport some of which is seasonal and all of which is weather dependent scheduled international airplane flights connect various kalaallit nunaat towns with reykjavk iceland but the main overseas passenger transport lifeline is between copenhagen and kalaallit nunaats airport hub of kangerlussuaq population 500 from which flights run to smaller airports elsewhere in the territory many of which in turn connect by helicopter to other towns and settlements around 18000 people live in nuuk kalaallit nunaats capital largest town and centre of business and governmentkalaallit nunaat was settled by the ancestors of todays inuit who arrived in the northwest of the island from presentday nunavut around 800 years ago prior to the colonial period the inuit pursued a seminomadic subsistence hunting lifestyle danish colonialism began in 1721 with a religious mission led by the lutheran pastor hans egede this mission set the precedent for establishing permanent settlements in the form of colonial towns beginning a long process of colonially driven cultural change beukal et al
2010 rud 2017 sonne 2017among the most immediately devastating impacts of this early colonial intervention was the introduction of disease in 17331734 smallpox brought over from copenhagen killed an estimated 10003000 inuit with the disease spreading rapidly as survivors fled from its epicentre in the areas surrounding nuuk klem 1966 bech 1999 gullv 2017 recurrent smallpox epidemics in later years were similarly catastrophic with an outbreak in the early 1780s nearly halving the population of nuuk and with an 1801 outbreak apparently reducing the populations of aasiaat by 42 per cent and of sisimiut by 89 per cent gad 1986 the earliest census of kalaallit nunaat undertaken in 1789 and including some estimates gave a total population of 5122 indicating that the epidemics of the early colonial period killed large proportions of the archipelagos inuit population the history of deadly diseases coming to kalaallit nunaat from denmark is thus at least as old as the history of colonialism in kalaallit nunaatkalaallit nunaat formally ceased to be a colony in 1953 when it was integrated into the danish state as a county a home rule system granting kalaallit nunaat considerable autonomy was introduced in 1979 in part due to denmarks increasing european integration with kalaallit nunaat ultimately leaving the european economic community predecessor to the european union in 1985 kalaallit nunaat today possesses complex relations with the european union of which it is classed as an overseas territory gad 2016 in 2009 kalaallit nunaat came under an even more empowering system of selfgovernment which significantly provided the snij with the right to become politically independent at the time of its own choosing opinion polls within kalaallit nunaat

recommending that the public take any exceptional measures kristiansen 2020a by 6 march the epidemics commission was recommending exceptional measures that closely followed danish policy such as advising against gatherings of over 1000 people kristiansen 2020b  an enormous number by kalaallit nunaat standards as it exceeds the populations of most settlements during this period kalaallit nunaat media reports concerning the novel coronavirus continued to be frequently accompanied by photographs of china andor chinese peopleas awareness of the situation in other countries and territories rose debate began among the kalaallit nunaat public regarding the appropriate response on 9 march it was feared that a plane from copenhagen had landed in kangerlussuaq carrying three infected individuals who had recently been in the faroes quarantine and selfisolation procedures were briefly introduced for some travellers but the subsequent covid19 tests came out negative sermitsiaqag 2020b some members of the public began arguing for the cancellation of all flights into the territory in order to prevent the virus from entering at this point scheduled flights were still running from copenhagen and reykjavik pele broberg 2020 a politician from partii naleraq used an open letter to the epidemics commission to propose a number of measures including use of kangerlussuaq as a checkpoint and quarantine site for people travelling into kalaallit nunaaton the evening of 11 march denmarks prime minister mette frederiksen announced that the country would be

case of covid19 in kalaallit nunaat a resident of nuuk was confirmed on 16 march the next day the government announced that all ordinary flights into out of and within kalaallit nunaat would be

across kalaallit nunaat with exceptions for students whose parents were unable to care for them for example because they were performing vital work functions schultznielsen 2020b 2020 the government strategy was not simply to mitigate the impacts of the virus as was being pursued in denmark by this point but to prevent it from ever gaining a foothold in the territory to begin with leading to a focus on restriction of movement contact tracing and the locking down of nuuk in particular jrgensen 2020on 6 april to the shock of many in kalaallit nunaat the danish government announced a planned gradual reopening of denmark from 15 april beginning with kindergartens and primary schools as a means of restarting the danish economy this was in some senses incompatible with the kalaallit nunaat strategy of eliminating the coronavirus from the snij entirely on 7 april the kalaallit nunaat government announced that kindergartens and schools outside of nuuk would begin reopening on 14 april but also that both internal and external travel restrictions would be extended until 1 mayat the time of writing 22 april 1150 individuals have been tested for covid19 in various parts of kalaallit nunaat eleven infections have been confirmed all in nuuk and all 11 infected individuals have recoveredover the past decades kalaallit nunaat has become progressively more integrated into global economic

28yearold student originally from uummannaq and now living in nuuk greenland always used to be far away from all the crises and now seems close to the rest of the world i think its the first time we truly feel that we are part of the world covid19 has highlighted both the fragility and the dangers of kalaallit nunaats global connections but it has also highlighted the strengths and opportunities connected to the territorys remote archipelagic geographyon the one hand the disruptions to kalaallit nunaats everyday connections with denmark have set in relief the renewal and reinvention of these links from the establishment of new air links to copenhagen via reykjavik for the transportation of test samples to the sharing of resources and expertise for all the discussion of kalaallit nunaats potential to choose its own alliances with countries to both the east and the west grydehj 2016 covid19 has brought kalaallit nunaat and denmark emotionally closer together even as it has kept inuit and danes physically apart this matches the global shift from the initial instruction of social distancing to physical distancing for reducing coronavirus transmission on the important premise that people need to remain as social as possible without physical proximity this situation also resembles the aftermath of the tsunami that devastated parts of kalaallit nunaat on 18 june 2017 which resulted in an outpouring of both governmental and private support from denmark nordvang jensen 2017 ak bendtsen 2020 6 april personal correspondence a 40yearold working in tourism management originally from qaqortoq and now living in nuuk feels that the situation has had a positive effect on the relationship between kalaallit nunaat and denmark stating that she didnt realize how connected we are with denmark and how we help each otheron the other hand the situation has also highlighted kalaallit nunaats capacity to stand by itself effectively designing and implementing policy in tense and rapidly developing situations kalaallit nunaats ability to survive and even thrive without its coloniser during germanys second world war occupation of denmark plays an important role in kalaallit nunaat national consciousness depending on how the situation develops the covid19 pandemic may come to play a similar role in kalaallit nunaat culture helping to clarify and rebalance what precisely kalaallit nunaat is capable of doing for itself what must come from denmark and what can come from elsewhere in the world as many of kalaallit nunaats key industries eg fishing tourism transport mining and hospitality face severe impediments or even total cessation of activities the government is stepping in to support both companies and individual employees with direct financial compensation munk veirum 2020 notwithstanding the reigning discourse of kalaallit nunaats economic dependence on denmark and its fundamental inability to act independently grydehj 2020 2020 the snij is acting very much like a great many sovereign states kalaallit nunaat has perhaps never seemed so independent as it does today these feelings of greater selfreliance may deepen further if denmarks 6 april shift toward an opening up policy comes to be seen not just as incompatible with but also as blatantly opposed to a kalaallit nunaat policy of virus eradicationkalaallit nunaat is in some respects a product of colonial cartography an inuit territory boxed in with denmark and separated from its immediate neighbours in nunavut to the west it is only in the past century that kalaallit nunaat has been imagined as a collection of towns and settlements joined together into a national consciousness by a particularly legible island geography grydehj et al
2020yet kalaallit nunaat is not simply an island territory it is specifically an archipelago with vast distances between towns and settlements that are not connected by road or rail on 17 march kalaallit nunaats prime minister kim kielsen explained the ban on internal flights within the territory by saying our country is unique in the sense that we are 74 isolated places which can each be shut down independently this allows us to keep the disease out of some towns and settlements lindstrm 2020b translation by first authorthe cultural economic and political gap between nuuk and kalaallit nunaats other towns and settlements has long been a matter of concern with many feeling that nuuk is an essentially danish town that has undue influence on the remainder of the territory grydehj 2014 conflicts between power centres and peripheries within archipelagos are not unique to kalaallit nunaat but are a common phenomenon favole  giordana 2018 at present nuuk  which as of 26 april is the site of all the snijs confirmed covid19 cases  finds itself in an unusual position subjected to a comprehensive lockdown while daily life in many other parts of kalaallit nunaat continues for many people along somewhat normal lines lars villadsen 2020 5 april personal correspondence translation by first author a 56yearold man originally from the small town of qasigiannguit and now living in nuuk writes thatin the rest of kalaallit nunaat restrictions are not nearly as strict as in nuuk  if were talking about use of public transport air greenland royal arctic line with its own passenger ship and the little regional shipping line disko line then transport has been halted for the time being  bearing in mind that there are not too many passengers anyway at this time of year the crisis is not so extreme relative to whats normal there are in any case few ordinary kalaallit who use these relatively expensive transport methods especially air greenlands and royal arctic lines prices where people have always been more or less tied to their locality people instead have tended to use small boats with outboard motors to get to the nearest settlement or town  there havent been big changes in product supply to and from towns settlements and regions
two correspondents express that the situation has created a sense of distance and changing power relations between nuuk and the rest of kalaallit nunaat describing feelings of loneliness and powerlessness as well as concern about an inability to visit friends and family both elsewhere in the snij and overseas the travel restrictions between towns and settlements have caused a variety of problems for example with the small settlements in the vicinity of nuuk being totally cut off from their only nearby town and with some children living in settlements being cut off from their school when it reopened in midapril because the school is located in a different municipality than their home settlement kristiansen 2020camong the special measures in nuuk has been a total ban on alcohol sales introduced with no warning and immediate effect for the purpose of protecting children and families living under lockdown schultznielsen 2020c 2020 several correspondents identify unanticipated results of this ban on alcohol sales ranging from mockery by individuals in other towns and settlements where no such restrictions are in place to shifts in relative social status with people seeking to avoid social contact with ethnic danes who are regarded as more likely to be infected because they are most likely to have travelled overseas rather than ethnic inuit of lower socioeconomic statusmultiple correspondents also note the importance of digital media in general and social media in particular for connecting people across kalaallit nunaat and elsewhere in the arctic as indeed was the case long before the pandemic began lanteigne 2020 the longrunning facebook group politikkikkut oqalliffik  politisk diskussionsrum political discussion room which is predominantly in the kalaallisut language and has at present 12338 members is now dominated by posts concerning covid19 on 16 march the largely kalaallisut facebook group covid19mut illersorumallutik angerlarsimaannartut ikorfartoqatigiiffiat support group for those who stay home to protect themselves against covid19 which currently has 6969 members was established with the purpose of facilitating mutual assistance among people coping with the challenges of covid19language has long been a point of social division in kalaallit nunaat due to kalaallisuts status as the most widely spoken language and danishs status as an elite language the snijs official language is the western dialect of kalaallisut there were complaints in the early days of the novel coronavirus spread in the snij that important information on the disease was being presented in danish alone in press conferences and on official websites thereby cutting off many members of society from timely and accurate information schultznielsen and kristiansen 2020 lindstrm 2020ainfectious disease cannot be separated from geopolitics due to its inseparability from relations of space power and resources garrett 1994 ingram 2009 hierarchies of space and power are startlingly evident in a 2018 danish university encyclopaedia entry on hans egede which turns the leader of the early eighteenthcentury colonial mission to the true victim of the colonial processwhen the smallpox epidemic spread in 173334 egede truly witnessed his lifes work crumble hundreds of the newly christianised inuit greenlanders died misfortunes continued to rain down upon him in 1735 his wife gertrud died after a period of illness and exhaustion from the immense work involved in keeping the colony running while her husband was travelling her death was a great blow to hans egede who chose to send her body to denmark a year later the destructiveness of the epidemic and his wifes death pushed him into depression mlholm olesen 2018 translation by first author

2016however globalised the world however integrated its economies and however mobile its people approaches to disease are still largely determined nationally regionally and locally the government of kalaallit nunaat may have found in the territorys archipelagic geography and small population a compelling argument for seeking to eradicate  not merely mitigate  the novel coronavirus such an argument proved impractical or insufficiently compelling for the government of denmark koch 2020 explained you dont want the virus to enter the country and you are in a position in greenland where you can actually shut down the country towns and settlements you cant do that efficiently in denmark policies that work in one society and one space may not work in another though the similarity of kalaallit nunaats strategy to that of china should caution against attempts to suggest any kind of geographical determinism yet the decisions made in different societies and spaces are mutually contingent pursuing mitigation in denmark may in the long term necessitate pursuing mitigation in kalaallit nunaat the same is true for more populous countries and territories that have pursued eradication strategies yet must adapt to a quite different policy approach internationallythe covid19 pandemic has had complex effects on both kalaallit nunaats relationship with the world as a whole and its relationship with itself looking back at the snijs colonial history lars villadsen 2020 5 april personal correspondence translation by first author assertskalaallit nunaat was to a certain extent brought together by the introduction of home rule and selfgovernment but has since then always lacked someone or something around which to unite someone  because we dont regard for example the prime minister neither the current or the past andor the parliament as a gathering point for the population  as a result there are a lot of loyal adherents to kalaallit nunaat as a territorial unit simply because we have nothing else around which to unify the nation none of the political parties have sought to exploit the crisis to their own ends  so they say  i feel that kalaallit nunaat has never been more structurally dependent on denmark  but a lot of people wish that kalaallit nunaat could itself undertake testing of corona samples in nuuk instead of in copenhagen as the chief medical officer henrik l hansen puts it we are waiting to receive equipment  from the usa
the imperial process by which the scattered peoples of todays kalaallit nunaat were gathered together into a colony then a county then a partly autonomous territory and now a highly autonomous territory has encouraged territorial understandings of nationhood understandings that are now under strain as kalaallit nunaat is pulled toward denmark and pulled apart from itself simultaneously three correspondents express the feeling that the coronavirus pandemic is serving to unite the nation into a collective to fight a common enemy in the form of covid19it might be speculated whether kalaallit nunaats particular combination of islandness and colonial history has encouraged its decision to simultaneously distance itself from denmark and deepen its dependence on danish expertise in response to the pandemic however the fact that those remote island societies with geographies governmental systems and settlement patterns most closely resembling those of kalaallit nunaat also generally possess histories of colonisation complicates efforts to distinguish between the impacts of being a remote island and being a colonised remote islandwho can say whether for example the pacific island countries of federated states of micronesia kiribati marshall islands niue palau samoa solomon islands tokelau tonga tuvalu and vanuatu  all of which as of 21 april have instituted travel restrictions and report no confirmed covid19 cases  would be responding any differently to the pandemic were they not majority indigenous territories that were with the arguable exception of tonga subjected to european colonialism certainly remote island communities that were not subject to european colonialism of a similar nature eg australias norfolk island and the uk overseas territories in the south atlantic have implemented similar travel restrictions though such territories have populations and land areas much smaller than those of most of the colonised island states and autonomous territoriesmeanwhile highly militarised or securitised territories struggle to exploit remote island geography in the same manner christmas island an australian external territory has become a covid19 quarantine site for australia similarly guam guhn a highly autonomous pacific island territory of the usa with its own history of changes in disease and healthcare due to colonisation hattori 2004 prasad  kurland 1997 could at least theoretically aspire to keep covid19 beyond its borders after taking quick efforts to contain the virus guhn has become a quarantine site for thousands of us military personnel from the uss theodore roosevelt an aircraft carrier that was stricken by large numbers of covid19 cases letman 2020 this has had knockon effects on other pacific island communities depending on flights from guhn such as the northern mariana islands another us territory as with many other policy areas there is always the potential for the geopolitical concerns of the metropole to override the interests of island societies remote island territories may be particularly likely to enjoy a degree of autonomy and independent decision making power but their interests may also be particularly easy for the metropole to overlookthis highlights the manner in which the challenges and opportunities related to island geography often overlap the pacific island state of vanuatu has reported no cases of covid19 as of 21 april  although testing has not been widespread  yet on 5 april cyclone harold a category 5 storm passed over the archipelago causing extensive damage in both the capital of port vila and other islands  precisely at a time when vanuatu will struggle to receive support from or the attention of the international community mcgarry 2020 the situation is of course even more serious for island states and territories that like fiji have been hit by both the storm and the virus lyons 2020 similarly caribbean island states and territories are struggling with food insecurity and economic collapse due to the closure of borders and breaking of supply chains from the usa ewingchow 2020island communities however small and remote they are or are assumed to be must innovate and adapt to global issues as they have always done kelman et al
2015 for the covid19 pandemic it is not just about the challenges of dealing with diseases  as has been welldocumented in the pacific for infectious diseases roth et al
2014  but also the sudden changes in economies such as almost no tourism and an expected drastic fall in remittances as the island diaspora lose their jobs the full implications of any changes to imports and exports such as trying to screen or disinfect for the virus are also not knownall these challenges affect all locations the research questions for island studies epidemiology and disaster research include i whether different types of islands used or could have used any isolation or remoteness traits such as kalaallit nunaats limited international flights and cruises to counter the pandemic and ii whether island population characteristics make islanders more susceptible to the disease or mortality for it both questions have been investigated for islands for the 19181920 spanish flu pandemic eg mamelund 2011 mcleod et al
2008 and the 2009 ah1n1 influenza pandemic kool et al
2013 discussion of these questions cannot overlook geopolitical factors which may render particular islands more or less likely to restrict transport solicit external support come together in solidarity or possess the necessary machinery of governance to craft a localised response to pandemicas we have seen isolation is just one factor affecting how islands are exposed to and react to infectious disease geopolitics matter tookalaallit nunaat has so far triumphed over the 2020 pandemic more or less in isolation yet covid19 like kalaallit nunaat itself does not exist in isolation it is created through and perpetuated by relations among peoples places and institutions when kalaallit nunaat someday  probably sooner rather than later  resumes its air transport links with denmark reenters the shuddering world economy and resumes its place in the global flow of people and products the disease or a variant might reappear there is every chance that kalaallit nunaats success at eradicating covid19 will prove only temporarythe coronavirus pandemic will nevertheless have changed kalaallit nunaats geopolitics the people of kalaallit nunaat will have a better idea of how much they owe to denmark how much they owe to themselves and what opportunities exist for future relations with other countries and territories they will also have a better idea of how nuuk and the snijs other towns and settlements relate to one another centres of power may be changing or shifting both externally and internally indeed it is increasingly being mooted both in kalaallit nunaat and abroad whether one result of the pandemic will be a longterm decrease in global connectivitythe precise results of the present situation will only become clear in the future once the situation has further developed further research will be needed in the coming months and years research that can consider these issues in retrospect but as long as there is a community of kalaallit nunaat the archipelagos story will never be complete it will always be developing in relationon 20th january 2020 epidemiologists at the chinese centre for disease control and

international concern  who 2020 given
that thousands of cases have been reported reaching all corners of the world in one
month this declaration was coupled with a number of recommendations related to
early detection of infection isolating and treating infected cases contact tracing
and social distancing measures that correspond to the level of risk in each country
with a key objective to interrupt or delay and hopefully limit the virus spreadwithin the united kingdom public health england announced it is moving the risk
level to the british public from very low to low on
22nd january this is also when first two patients in the uk tested positive for
coronavirus after two chinese nationals from the same family staying at a hotel in
york fell ill a plane clearing britons from wuhan and evacuees went into a 14-day
quarantine at a specialist hospital in merseyside  bfpg 2020 after confirming the first transmission of
disease within the uk the government decided not to follow italy and china where
the highest figures of infection and death were recorded the lockdown approach that
imposes restrictions on liberty and movement was not favoured by the government
instead throughout february 2020 the government advised a range of voluntary
restrictions such as social distancing and if any symptoms are
exhibited self-isolation and quarantine on the 5th march infected cases were
reported in all areas of the uk 105 in england six in scotland three in wales
and one in northern ireland  bbc

the virus is highly infectious and at the time of writing this article there is no
known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 disease despite claims
by various governments that a vaccine or treatment is being developed the key
measure of the global public health campaign in response to the pandemic is social
distancing which in essence is avoiding face contact and encouraging physical
distancingthe significant contributions to stop and treat viruses and associated diseases fall
within various academic disciplines and professions most important medical
scientists biologists and public health researchers are the key contributors to a
pandemic of this nature and scale they conduct laboratory research to understand
the attributes of the virus and the characteristics of the family of viruses it
belongs to they experiment develop test and advance vaccines for mass use and
eventually identify effective treatments professionals and scholars from other
disciplines are also contributors such as mathematicians and computer scientists
whose work through modelling techniques enable an effective understanding of
global patterns of virus spread and mortality rates social and behavioural
scientists contribute to the development of policies in the sense that they enable
institutions and organisations to identify risks and manage responses as they relate
to their employees and communities while addressing issues related to anxiety
loneliness and mental healtharchitecture and urbanism as academic disciplines and professions that influence in
many different ways individuals communities and societies can support efforts
through developing new insights into the impact of a pandemic on cities and urban
environments now and in the future developing new understandings relevant to the
characteristics of urban spaces which ensue from these insights conducting research
to comprehend the socio-spatial implications of covid-19 measures and guidelines
introduced by governments and authorities to fight the spread of the disease
identifying new conceptions related to emerging lifestyles which stem from the new
spatial environments that integrate working and living patterns and ultimately
developing design responses towards creating healthy environments that successfully
accommodate the infected populations while addressing the associated social and
psychological ramificationsat the time of writing this article there is no sufficient or available empirical
research conducted to address to the preceding areas of potential contributions both
at the architectural building and urban city scales this article nonetheless
aims to interrogate these areas by instigating important questions while striving to
generate responses through conceptualisation operationalization and referencing
the available literature the fundamental aim is to underscore relevant factors
originate insights of potential use to policy makers architects and planners
highlight areas where future research will be critically needed and emphasise the
positive role architecture and urban design and planning fields can play in
developing healthy environments in a globally virtual worldsocial distancing measures are a vital part of mitigating pandemics they complement
other measures in decreasing the prospect of the spread of disease the current body
of knowledge points out that social distancing is not a new measure to mitigate the
spread but has been introduced and practiced during the past several decades
researchers have developed important evidence on the potential impact of social
distancing arguing that it is moderately effective  ahmppi 2019 therefore where socio-economic impacts are
insignificant social distancing has been viewed at least as an acceptable
temporary measure while referred to as physical distancing in many writings social
distancing is a set of infection control actions envisioned to slow down or delay
and eventually stop the spread of an infectious disease  harris et al 2020 it aims to reduce the
likelihood of contact between persons carrying an infection and others who are not
infected so as to reduce virus transmission sickness and minimise mortality 
hensley 2020despite the suggestion made by ahmppi
2019 there appears to be growing evidence of the effectiveness of social
distancing when infection is transmitted through droplet contact which may result
from all forms of physical contact between people and contact with contaminated
surfaces and fabrics it is also effective when transmission is airborne where the
virus can survive in the air for a period of time there is no clear evidence
however that social distancing is effective when infection is transmitted through
contact with water food or through insectssocial distancing measures were introduced by the world health organization in
response to the initially gradual and then exponentially global spread of
coronavirus the measures were generic in nature and were subject to various
interpretations of governments in the global north and the global south so they can
respond to the level of risk in each country or even residential neighbourhood or
locality these interpretations range from flexible or minor social distancing
measures to lockdown or in some countries various types of curfews during defined
timeframes within the day or the weekmeasures of social distancing are practiced at both institutional and individual
levels at an institutional level there is common agreement on what social
distancing entails as evidenced in government documents of countries around the
world  phe 2020 pancap 2020 in this context the key elements are school
closure workplace closure and cancellation of mass gatherings this is further
expanded to include closure of small businesses restaurants cinemas theatres
bars pubs and clubs according to phe
2020 at an individual level social distancing entails reducing or
minimising interaction between people and involves a avoidance of non-essential
use of public transport especially during rush hours b working from home where
possible with regulations set for employers to support this c avoidance of contact
with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus covid-19 which include
high temperature andor new and continuous cough d avoidance of large gatherings
and gatherings in smaller public spaces and e avoidance of gatherings with friends
and family with recommendations to use distance technology including phone
internet and social mediastrikingly many social media posts online newspapers portals and discussion
boards and academic platforms are now introducing and discussing the notion of the
new normal portraying this as a new paradigm which will involve
many new realities and intensive online activities that range from retail and
shopping to banking and higher education prevision to name a few it is argued
social distancing is here to stay for much more than a few weeks it will
upend our way of life in some ways forever  lichfield 2020 there is strong evidence that there is now
a high degree of acceptability among governments institutions organisations and
universities that contemporary societies are approaching a new era characterised by
intensive digitalvirtual practices to which the way of life must be adapted in
particular and in the immediate future until it becomes actually
normal there is a general appreciation that such a new normal will have
negative consequences which include loneliness reduced productivity unhealthy
sleeping and eating habits potential obesity and loss of various benefits
associated with reduced human-human and human-environment interactionswith social distancing measures the remarkable shift from the physical to the
virtual and the acceptance of this there are many social and spatial implications
that architects planners and built environment professionals would be keen to
examine in this respect key questions arise to address various scales and scopes
and can be outlined as followsthe preceding questions do not cover the entire spectrum of issues and potential
impacts arising from social distancing and the new normal for example issues
associated with risk management construction processes and practice management are
not included yet the questions cover some fundamentals that are believed to be of
interest to the global community of architects and urban designers and planners and
that are predicted to generate new conceptions develop new insights and eventually
inform new thinking about the future of architecture and urbanism this would also
instigate a discourse on role of architecture and urbanism in developing healthy
environments and supporting emerging lifestyles in a post pandemic virtual eraanswering complex questions like the ones presented in the preceding section requires
responses underpinned by a commitment to trans-disciplinarity it should be seen as
a form of research involving co-operation among different parts of society
professionals and academia  dunnin-woyseth
 nielsen 2004 pohl  hirsch
hadorn 2008 in order to meet complex challenges in the context of
covid-19 spread and the resulting new normal and eventually the actual normal
therefore trans-disciplinarity is about blurring then transcending the boundaries
of different disciplines starting from tangible real-world problems knowledge is
developed produced and reproduced based on a collaboration of people from different
disciplinary backgrounds  doucet  janssens
2011 its hybrid nature and non-linearity enables it to transcend and
indeed incorporate any academic disciplinary structure adopting trans-disciplinary
thinking at conceptual and critical analysis levels a framework is developed
through which responses to the questions are based on operationalization of concepts
and theories derived from various disciplines as they relate to architecture and
urbanism  figure 1 outlined as followswhile the discussion does not fully address every single discipline shown in the
diagram all the perspectives and dimensions discussed have to do with researching
and designing built environmentsit is argued that infectious disease has a direct relationship with urban
development and would result in significant impact on our understanding of
urbanism hang 2020 suggests that
the increasing density of cities has generated conditions for the rapid spread
of viruses by comparing the spread of sars-cov in 2003 and sars-cov-2 in
201920 it is evident that population density has a direct impact on the rapid
spread in the case of sars-cov within china more than 5000 people were
infected and more than 300 died over a period of eight months yet in the case
of sars-cov-2 more than 4000 people were infected over a period of seven weeks
this could be attributed to the fact that chinese cities have developed into
both dense and sprawling urban areas with higher population density resulting
from migration from rural to urban areas klaus 2020 interviewed michele acuto professor of global urban
politics in the school of design at the university of melbourne and the
question of density and density management were central to the discussion and
were portrayed as the  long term survival in a pandemic
world klaus
2020 supports this view and argues  part of the
history of urbanization is building and managing your way out of infectious
diseases such as cholera outbreaks in the middle of the 19th
century
badger 2020 adopts an opposing view
and argues that high density is not necessarily a public health issue she
evidences this by putting the case of singapore and hong kong as urban
environments that are dense or denser than new york and how they were able to
develop early testing and extensive tracing of coronavirus cases rather than
extensive isolation she advocates density for the multiple benefits it brings
to cities unique cultural richness these include facilitating mass
transportation creating walkable environments enabling the masses to enjoy
public spaces supporting childrens needs through urban parks and
playgrounds limiting climate emissions supporting personal and public safety
to name a few it is increasingly acknowledged following sennett 2016 and shenker 2020 that the future of cities will involve a renewed
focus on developing architectural and urban solutions that enable people to
socialise without higher densities and sardines-like
packingthe work of keil et al
2020 suggests that there is a close relationship between urban
development and new or re-emerging contagious diseases rapid means of
transportation the continuous expansion of urban sprawl and connectivity
between urban life and nature are factors that contribute to such a spread from
urban peripheries to urban centres however patterns of disease emergence and
spread within urbanisation would require in-depth empirical modelling and
investigations of historical cases and juxtaposing these with the case of
coronavirus spreadthe persistent question that urban design and planning experts will face in the
future is about balancing conflicting value on the one hand densification and
making cities more compact and concentrated for the environmentally and socially
sustainable benefits compactness is viewed to bring on the other hand
compartmentalisation and separation of populations through various measures
including social distancing as a key tool being used to delay or stop virus
spread while compactness and density are important determinants for successful
urban environments in cultural social and environmental terms current
discussions suggest that the future development of cities will witness
encounters between contested requisites including public health climate and
socio-economic dynamicsin meeting the challenge of the covid-19 spread cities are adopting various
strategies at a large scale while cities are at the forefront of the response
to the pandemic they will likely see enduring transformation and permanent
changes while it is argued that cities and urbanism have been shaped by
contagious disease for centuries the global nature of covid-19 is anticipated
to bring significant changes to policies and the associated institutional and
individual behaviours in essence these changes while they have already
started to alter the way people live and work will alter how cities are planned
and managed for decades to come null 
smith 2020 identified a number of areas that delineate various
strategies restricting access to travel and questing for alternatives to public
transitlocally and globally measures for limiting travel are most apparent in the sense
of how cities are now operating in a short period of time travel restrictions
among other measures have had negative impacts including destroyed economies
unemployment and a dramatic reduction in industrial production however some
positive impacts are also witnessed in terms of a reduction in air pollution and
carbon emissions in the cases of italy and china nasa satellite data
illustrate significant changes in air pollution levels  nasa 2020 and a 25 drop in carbon emissions as
lockdown and restrictions started to show results  null  smith 2020coupled with the reduction in train and bus operations in many cities around the
world local and global travel restrictions are expected to have significant
implications on the what and how of urban planning in the future given the
established correlations between morality rates and urban air pollution with
positive impacts on the health of urban societies however these will need to
be balanced in the context of climate change and sustainability if the city is
expanded rather than compacted this must be associated with better connectivity
through alternative forms of public transport as people avoid crowds and
movement is restricted reports suggest that public transit use has taken a
sharp decline  hawkins 2020 moovit 2020 nuki 2020 the planning of future cities would be
derived from enhanced policies that further support cycling and walkingcontagious disease outbreaks are indeed global incidents as evident in the
spread of coronavirus from wuhan to various cities around the world lockdown
and quarantining of many mega and global cities is impacting the global
condition at various scales including globalised urban lifestyles the rapid
spread of disease takes place through infrastructures of globalisation which
includes global air travel links keil
et al 2020 argue that airports are often
located at the peripheries of cities and urban areas and this raises questions
about responsibility and accountability in terms of managing disease spread to
the wider urban regions in 2003 sars impacted global centres of trade and
commerce including beijing hong kong singapore and toronto however covid-19
has severely impacted global cities in the global north such as london and new
york and global infrastructure such as airport hubs aviation networks and
places of industrial productionan interesting phenomenon emerges out of the current discussion of the threat of
covid-19 there is a heavy focus on discussing repercussions of spread in
universal terms and this reinforces existing inequalities  wilkinson 2020 in particular
informal settlements and slums in the global south and the associated urban
poverty do not seem to have enjoyed a sufficient share within current
discussions and media reports this could be attributed to the fact that these
settlements are already on the margin and that communities are already
underrepresented where crises are the norm and thus there is nothing new
despite the significant lack of information there is a risk that infection
rates and transmission will be significantly higher than in planned cities and
urban areas to alleviate the negative consequences of these and introduce
positive interventions in informal settlements in the long term architects and
planners would need to establish new lenses through which they can comprehend
health and living conditions that generate relevant intervention strategiesgeographical locations refer to the key places and areas that influence
peoples perception of the city such as living working shopping and
entertainment places or destinations derived from the theory of territoriality
home zone and home range are constructs that
represent areas which influence peoples mental image of important
geographical locations establishing links between the physical environment and
social behaviour theorists and researchers have examined these insights in
various contexts  abdel-hadi et
al 2011 altman
1975 rapoport 2005 salama et al 2013 in
this respect it is important to discern how these constructs can be
differentiated home zone signifies an environment with minor or no requirement
for transportation this includes locales that are accessed effortlessly through
walking thereby stimulating a sense of ownership and belonging among the
residents within these locales irrespective of scale and size home range
denotes a more inclusive mental image of the entire residential environment
placing emphasis on the perceived geographical boundary such as that of
residential neighbourhood or clusters of housing developmentswithin urban design and planning disciplines a city is perceived as a fluid
dynamic system which involves material and non-material inputs and outputs that
flow in out and within this relates to the notion of geographical locations
and represents at a larger scale a process of movement and mobility within the
city and beyond in historical writings  burgess 1925 sorokin
1927 and contemporary debates  geyer  kontuly 1996 movement and urban mobility have been
discussed from various perspectives in the past the focus was on social and
behavioural factors recently however the notion of networks the spatial
structure and the peoples perception of both were introducedunderstanding urban mobility or movement patterns within the city will be crucial
to conceiving interaction measures between geographical locations within the
spatial structure urban networks and the associated operational requirements
the distribution of functions and uses peoples movement patterns and
the rhythm of commuting between geographical locations within the city will all
constitute important design and planning criteria that carefully consider health
and the potential spread of disease within the citys urban structure
acting as imperatives these considerations will enable lessening or
eliminating the spread of viruses to various geographical locations from the
urban peripheries and around airports to urban cores or residential
neighbourhoods this incudes in depth modelling of how far from and how long it
takes to commute to the city core from living areas to work areas public
places entertainment places and within residential neighbourhoods such
modelling should also embed user types and age ranges with a focus on
vulnerable groupssince social distancing measures are currently planned to last at least six
months it is believed that they will have various forms of impacts on both
urban researchers and the public concepts and theories related to place
attachment personal space and relationships between individuals and groups as
well as proximity to nature will need to be revisitedplace attachment is highly influenced by an individual and his or her personal
experiences  rollero  de piccoli
2010 it is multi-dimensional and cannot be explained through a
cause and effect relationship since it depends on a reciprocal relationship
between human behaviour and past and current experiences  giuliani 2016 scannell  gifford 2010 in essence it relates to affect
cognition and behaviour places of attachment include the home neighbourhood
urban settings and natural landscapes attachment to these places is typically
measured through many qualities depending on the typology and use of place
these qualities include aesthetics heritage family connection recreation
therapeutic biological diversity wilderness home intrinsic spiritual
economic life-sustaining learning and future post pandemic place attachment
conception would involve reweighing many of these qualities with more emphasis
placed upon on qualities related to healthy hygienic sanitised and healing
environments this may also lead to the rise of disaster psychology which aims
to examine the relationship between a city urban area or neighbourhood and
their inhabitants attitudes and emotions in the context of detrimental
incidents such as coronavirus spread and an increasing sense of personal safety
and healththe established canons of personal space and proximity relationships introduced
in the mid 1960s  hall 1966 and
hall  hall 1966 are
critical to grasp in the context of social distancing measures personal space
determines how people relate socially and psychologically and can be represented
by an area bubble with an invisible boundary surrounding the persons
body into which intruders may not come such a bubble is carried everywhere one
goes based on intensive empirical studies hall 1966 explained the relative distances between people
depending on the relationships they have and classified them in four discrete
distance ranges intimate distance 1 to 46 cm personal distance 46 to 122
cm social distance 12 to 37 m and public distance 37 to 76 m and
more with social distancing measures and the minimum allowance of 2 meters
personal distance the relative distance ranges would entirely change
especially if social distancing measures are viewed in the future as accepted
standardscurrently there is a growing interest in designing healing environments ryan et al 2014
argues that the surge of interest in creating spaces and places that support
health and wellbeing is viewed as a renaissance in design thinking and the way
in which buildings and cities are designed and built salingaros 2015 contends that biophilic design
effectively eliminates stress and anxiety from the built environment and is
achieved by maintaining thoughtful engagement with nature recently researchers
have been investigating the syntactic relationships between people and nature 
asfour 2019 rice 2019 to 
grierson 2019 in such a quest they attempt to demonstrate the
role of architecture and urbanism in developing healthy and healing environments
and how design can be informed to allow critical humannature associations to
prosper social distancing measures may encourage less association with people
in urban settings and may give further rise to biophilic design trendsthe urban has been defined as a place of encounter
assembly simultaneity  lefebvre
1970118 it is argued that there are two polar perspectives
associated with the term which stem from various disciplinary territories
urban form and urban life while urban from is the sphere of urban designers
architects urban planners and transportation engineers urban life is the
territory of social scientists human geographers and sociologists as argued
by susser 2002 urban form refers to
the spatial concentration of populace within a specific area of land limits to
building and population densities and certain qualities of buildings and
spaces urban life epitomises the collective which refers to
the diffusion of the system of values attitudes customs and behaviours of a
specific group of people associations between urban form and urban life have
been studied thoroughly  salama et
al 2017a through a sustained and consistent
understanding that they cannot be discussed in isolation where urban form is
shaped and influenced by urban life and urban life arises from urban formthe urban place has been expressed in various studies as having contrasting
attributes based on the characteristics of form and the nature of the activities
taking place within that form positive attributes include diversity tolerance
association integration personal network-formation  fischer 1977 and frequent spontaneous interactions
while these qualities represent an ideal condition and confirm lefebvre 1970 postulation the urban
place has been portrayed in negative attributes  halpern 1995 that include anonymity detachment
loneliness formalised social control segregation isolation fear and mental
illness the covid-19 social distancing measures will have an impact on the
perception of some of these qualities especially if these measures in part or
in whole become the norm and part of the new normal an example for this is
that spontaneous interactions would become less or non- spontaneous while
formalised social control will take place as a positive rather than a negative
attributethe suggestion made by walzer 1986
that public space is where we share with strangers people who
arent our relatives friends or work associates could entirely
change given the cognizance of users regarding the risks associated with
engaging with others they do not know if social distancing measures become part
of the collective psyche of societies it could lead to a significant change in
comprehending the needs in public spaces by revisiting the notions of social
interaction assembly and simultaneity active engagement which represents the
direct experience a person has with a place and the people within it would be
limited or directed more towards passive engagement that involves meeting the
need for encounter without becoming actively involved this includes watching
the passing scene rather than talking or doingsince the mid 1970s urban theorists have conceived various triadic relationships
that established a common understanding of places canter 1977 developed an understanding of the
constituents of place which include psychological conceptions physical
attributes and actions and behaviours punter 1991 introduced mental image form and activity while
mongomery 1998 discussed factors
that generate a sense of place involving meaning physical setting and activity
post pandemic urban design would need to emphasise factors relevant to spatial
proximity as it relates to health in order to limit the potential spread of
viruses or reacting to peoples awareness of it this could eventually
lead to altering the triadic relationships which were part of urban discourse
for several decadessocial distancing guidelines coupled with operating in a post pandemic virtual world
will instigate new living and working patterns which will result in different
spatial requirements and place standards to understand the spatiality of these
dynamics it is crucial to relate to the body of knowledge developed within social
sciences  adler et al
1987 which has significant implications on the notion of place as a
human product involving human choices following giddens 1984 and pred
1984 these products and choices are based on factors relevant to how
different elements of a society interact and a critical understanding of people
organisations agencies and the power that each element of a society has this
understanding can be further elaborated based on ethnographic and anthropological
perspectives as they relate to the built environment  salama 2011 salama
et al 2017bfrom an ethnographic perspective the concept of life-mode  hojrup 2003 offers insights into the understanding that
human values are constrained by cultural-relational dialectics and are products of
cultural life modes which can be classified according to work styles self-employed
mode wage-earner mode and career-oriented mode from an anthropological
perspective douglas 1996 discusses a
life style scheme that relates to attitudes rather than work these attitudes can be
envisaged as sub-cultures that include competition and individualism isolation and
avoidance of social controls equity and negotiation and hierarchical communities
the two perspectives have direct spatial implications on how post pandemic emerging
patterns of living and working will be spatially accommodatedthe spatial implications resulting from the two perspectives can be extrapolated when
looking at various manifestations of the home environment and home choices  salama 2011 in terms of work the
self-employed life mode is where means of production are owned and included within
the house this means that the home environment is conceived as an integrated living
and working place where work time and spare time are not separated the wage-earner
life mode means that the home environment is regarded as either a primary place
serving recreational purposes or a place where important spare-time family or
personal activities are undertaken the career-oriented life mode means that the
home environment reflects the personal progress position social status and past
and recent experiences additionally the notion of sub-cultures determines housing
preference based on social attitudes especially isolation and avoidance of social
control and will manifest in post pandemic housing choices including preferred
aspects related to the house integration within the neighbourhood and the overall
house size and imagewhether work-based or status- and attitude-based the spatial attributes of home and
work environments post pandemic should be seen as a product of distancing measures
and of operating in a virtualdigital world which will instigate new living and
working patterns these implications will influence the existing housing stock and
working places which will require appropriation and adaptation and the new
developments of home and work environments requiring new standards and
specificationsthe public health catastrophe caused by coronavirus and the rapid spread of covid-19
disease has significant impacts on societies and cities around the world the
trans-disciplinary conceptual framework utilised for analysing urban and
socio-spatial implications of covid-19 measures reveals important insights into the
factors that will impact future education research and practice of architecture
and urban design and planning these factors act as a base for potential
contributions of architecture and urbanism as academic disciplines and professions
to develop new insights into the impact of a pandemic on cities and urban
environments and the socio-spatial implications of covid-19 measures and guidelines
immediate research areas were classified under three key areas urban dynamics
during and post covid-19 socio-spatial implications of distancing measures and the
requirements of the new spatial environments to accommodate post pandemic emerging
living and working patterns  figure 2 as the
spread of covid-19 has influenced individuals communities organisations and
governments its impacts will be on every level and scale from global networks and
infrastructure to global cities and urban regions and from residential
neighbourhoods and public spaces to home and work environments and will continue
for many years to comeaccording to forsyth 2020 
the current pandemic brings the question of designing for infectious
diseases back to the forefront however and raises important questions for
future research and practice therefore the development of
healthy environments must be central to architecture and urbanism in the future
despite that health does seem to be absent within the education and practice of
architecture and urban design and planning professions forsyth 2020 asserts this view and argues 
for the past decades those looking at the intersections of planning
design and public health have focused less on infectious diseases and more on
chronic disease hazards and disasters and the vulnerable
rice 2019 maintains that the design
of the built environment is a determinant of health and thus there is an increasing
need for greater synergy between architectural and urban education research and
practice and public healththe spread of the disease generated a condition which is labelled as the new normal
resulting from social distancing measures and is characterised by human detachment
isolation and engagement in a virtual world coupled with an emphasis on working
from home through the utilisation of information and telecommunication technologies
the acceptability of the new normal as a result of attempting to limit the disease
spread appears to be a catalyst for a future stable condition the actual normal
while addressing health in a post pandemic virtual world negative consequences
emerge where many people around the world will be living and working in confined
spaces surrounded by gigantic cities and massive high-rise agglomerationsthe new normal  to be the actual normal  was foretold in the writings
of theorists in architecture and urbanism manuel castells in his book the rise of the network society economy society
and culture 2000 developed a methodical theory of the information
society which is based on the overpowering impacts of information technology in a
contemporary global world his assumption that the global city is not necessarily a
place but a process seems to manifest in the future stable condition the visionary
trilogy of the late william mitchell is clear evidence that the actual normal
represents the prospects of societies and citiesthe stable condition of the actual normal is palpable in the city of
bits  mitchell 1995 where
mitchell examines architecture and urbanism in the context of the digital
telecommunications revolution the continuing miniaturization of electronics the
commodification of bits and the growing domination of the digital over the
physical in the e-topia 1999 mitchell
examines the way in which an electronically connected world will shape cities of the
future and the associated urban relationships with a focus on digital
infrastructure and its implications for future daily lives mitchell asserts that we
must extend the definitions of architecture and urban design to integrate virtual
places as well as physical ones and interconnection by means of telecommunication
links as well as by pedestrian circulation and mechanized transportation systems he
proposes strategies for the creation of cities that not only will be sustainable but
also will make economic social and cultural sense in an electronically
interconnected and global world while this conceptualisation would seem an
imaginary future it appears now as a representation of the stable condition of the
actual normal mitchells book me the
cyborg self and the networked city 2003 answers the question of how the
transformation of wireless technology and the creation of an interconnected world
are changing our environment and our lives he argues a world governed less and less
by boundaries and more and more by connections requires the reconstruction of our
environment and our cities and reconsideration of the ethical foundations of
architecture urbanism and allied disciplinesin a transition period called the new normal which will eventually become a stable
condition of the actual normal societies communities and individuals appear to be
at odds speculating the future that future seems to have already arrived at our
doorsteps perhaps forcefully perhaps arbitrarily perhaps in a shock and
awe manner but surely at the expense of disease panic mental illness and
deathno data are associated with this articlein december 2019 a novel strand of coronavirus sars-cov-2 was identified in wuhan hubei province china causing a severe and potentially fatal respiratory syndrome ie covid-19 since then it has become a pandemic declared by world health organization who on march 11 which has spread around the globe 1 2 3 4 5 who published in its website preliminary guidelines with public health care for the countries to deal with the pandemic 6 since then the infectious disease has become a public health threat italy and usa are severely affected by covid-19 7 8 9 millions of people are forced by national governments to stay in self-isolation and in difficult conditions the disease is growing fast in many countries around the world in the absence of availability of a proper medicine or vaccine currently social distancing self-quarantine and wearing a face mask have been emerged as the most widely-used strategy for the mitigation and control of the pandemicin this context mathematical models are required to estimate disease transmission recovery deaths and other significant parameters separately for various countries that is for different specific regions of high to low reported cases of covid-19 different countries have already taken precise and differentiated measures that are important to control the spread of the disease however still now important factors such as population density insufficient evidence for different symptoms transmission mechanism and unavailability of a proper vaccine makes it difficult to deal with such a highly infectious and deadly disease especially in high population density countries such as india 10 11 12 recently many research articles have adopted the modelling approach using real incidence datasets from affected countries and have investigated different characteristics as a function of various parameters of the outbreak and the effects of intervention strategies in different countries respective to their current situationsit is imperative that mathematical models are developed to provide insights and make predictions about the pandemic to plan effective control strategies and policies 13 14 15 modelling approaches 8 16 17 18 19 20 21 are helpful to understand and predict the possibility and severity of the disease outbreak and provide key information to determine the intensity of covid-19 disease intervention the susceptible-infected-removed sir model and its extended modifications 22 23 24 25 such as the extended-susceptible-infected-removed esir mathematical model in various forms have been used in previous studies 26 27 28 to model the spread of covid-19 within communitieshere we propose the use of a novel sir model with different characteristics one of the major assumptions of the classic sir model is that there is a homogeneous mixing of the infected and susceptible populations and that the total population is constant in time in the classic sir model the susceptible population decreases monotonically towards zero however these assumptions are not valid in the case of the spread of the covid-19 virus since new epicentres spring up around the globe at different times to account for this the sir model that we propose here does not consider the total population and takes the susceptible population as a variable that can be adjusted at various times to account for new infected individuals spreading throughout a community resulting in an increase in the susceptible population ie to the so-called surges the sir model we introduce here is given by the same simple system of three ordinary differential equations odes with the classic sir model and can be used to gain a better understanding of how the virus spreads within a community of variable populations in time when surges occur importantly it can be used to make predictions of the number of infections and deaths that may occur in the future and provide an estimate of the time scale for the duration of the virus within a community it also provides us with insights on how we might lessen the impact of the virus what is nearly impossible to discern from the recorded data alone consequently our sir model can provide a theoretical framework and predictions that can be used by government authorities to control the spread of covid-19in our study we used covid-19 datasets from 29 in the form of time-series spanning january to june 2020 in particular the time series are composed of three columns which represent the total cases itotd active cases id and deaths dd in time rows these datasets were used to update parameters of the sir model to understand the effects and estimate the trend of the disease in various communities represented by china south korea india australia usa italy and the state of texas in the usa this allowed us to estimate the development of covid-19 spread in these communities by obtaining estimates for the number of deaths d susceptible s infected i and removed rm populations in time consequently we have been able to estimate its characteristics for these communities and assess the effectiveness of modelling the diseasethe paper is organised as following in sec 2 we introduce the sir model and discuss its various aspects in sec 3 we explain the approach we used to study the data in 29 and in sec 4 we present the results of our analysis for china south korea india australia usa italy and the state of texas in the usa section 5 discusses the implications of our study to the flattening the curve approach finally in sec 6 we conclude our work and discuss the outcomes of our analysis and its connection to the evidence that has been already collected on the spread of covid-19 worldwidethe world around us is highly complicated for example how a virus spreads including the novel strand of coronavirus sars-cov-2 that was identified in wuhan hubei province china depends upon many factors among which some of them are considered by the classic sir model which is rather simplistic and cannot take into consideration surges in the number of susceptible individuals here we propose the use of a modified sir model with characteristics based upon the classic sir model in particular one of the major assumptions of the classic sir model is that there is a homogeneous mixing of the infected i and susceptible s populations and that the total population n is constant in time also in the sir model the susceptible population s decreases monotonically towards zero these assumptions however are not valid in the case of the spread of the covid-19 virus since new epicentres spring up around the globe at different times to account for this we introduce here a sir model that does not consider the total population n but rather takes the susceptible population s as a variable that can be adjusted at various times to account for new infected individuals spreading throughout a community resulting in its increase thus our model is able to accommodate surges in the number of susceptible individuals in time whenever these occur and as evidenced by published data such as those in 29 that we consider hereour sir model is given by the same simple system of three ordinary differential equations odes with the classic sir model that can be easily implemented and used to gain a better understanding of how the covid-19 virus spreads within communities of variable populations in time including the possibility of surges in the susceptible populations thus the sir model here is designed to remove many of the complexities associated with the real-time evolution of the spread of the virus in a way that is useful both quantitatively and qualitatively it is a dynamical system that is given by three coupled odes that describe the time evolution of the following three populations1
susceptible individuals st these are those individuals who are not infected however could become infected a susceptible individual may become infected or remain susceptible as the virus spreads from its source or new sources occur more individuals will become infected thus the susceptible population will increase for a period of time surge period2
infected individuals it these are those individuals who have already been infected by the virus and can transmit it to those individuals who are susceptible an infected individual may remain infected and can be removed from the infected population to recover or die3
removed individuals rmt these are those individuals who have recovered from the virus and are assumed to be immune rmt or have died dt
furthermore it is assumed that the time scale of the sir model is short enough so that births and deaths other than deaths caused by the virus can be neglected and that the number of deaths from the virus is small compared with the living populationbased on these assumptions and concepts the rates of change of the three populations are governed by the following system of odes what constitutes our sir model1dstdtastitditdtastitbitdrmtdtbitwhere a and b are real positive parameters of the initial exponential growth and final exponential decay of the infected population iit has been observed that in many communities a spike in the number of infected individuals i may occur which results in a surge in the susceptible population s recorded in the covid-19 datasets 29 what amounts to a secondary wave of infections to account for such a possibility s in the sir model 1 can be reset to ssurge at any time ts that a surge occurs and thus it can accommodate multiple such surges if recorded in the published data in 29 what distinguishes it from the classic sir modelthe evolution of the infected population i is governed by the second ode in system 1 where a is the transmission rate constant and b the removal rate constant we can define the basic effective reproductive rate reastb as the fate of the evolution of the disease depends upon it if re is smaller than one the infected population i will decrease monotonically to zero and if greater than one it will increase ie if ditdt0re1 and if ditdt0re1 thus the effective reproductive rate re acts as a threshold that determines whether an infectious disease will die out quickly or will lead to an epidemicat the start of an epidemic when re  1 and s  1 the rate of infected population is described by the approximation ditdtabit and thus the infected population i will initially increase exponentially according to iti0eabt the infected population will reach a peak when the rate of change of the infected population is zero ditdt0 and this occurs when re1 after the peak the infected population will start to decrease exponentially following itebt thus eventually for t   the system will approach s  0 and i  0 interestingly the existence of a threshold for infection is not obvious from the recorded data however can be discerned from the model this is crucial in identifying a possible second wave where a sudden increase in the susceptible population s will result in re  1 and to another exponential growth of the number of infections ithe data in 29 for china south korea india australia usa italy and the state of texas communities are organised in the form of time-series where the rows are recordings in time from january to june 2020 and the three columns are the total cases itotd first column number of infected individuals id second column and deaths dd third column consequently the number of removals can be estimated from the data by2rmditotdidddsince we want to adjust the numerical solutions to our proposed sir model 1 to the recorded data from 29 for each dataset community we consider initial conditions in the interval 01 and scale them by a scaling factor f to fit the recorded data by visual inspection in particular the initial conditions for the three populations are set such that s01 ie all individuals are considered susceptible initially i0rm0imaxdf1 where imaxd is the maximum number of infected individuals id consequently the parameters a b f and imaxd are adjusted manually to fit the recorded data as best as possible based on a trial-and-error approach and visual inspections a preliminary analysis using non-linear fittings to fit the model to the published data 29 provided at best inferior results to those obtained in this paper using our trial-and-error approach with visual inspections in the sense that the model solutions did not follow as close the published data what justifies our approach in the paper a prime reason for this is that the published data including those in 29 we are using here are data from different countries that follow different methodologies to record them with not all infected individuals or deaths accounted forin this context s i and rm  0 at any t  0 system 1 can be solved numerically to find how the scaled by f susceptible s infected i and removed rm populations what we call model solutions evolve with time in good agreement with the recorded data in particular since this system is simple with well-behaved solutions we used the first-order euler integration method to solve it numerically and a time step h2005000004 that corresponds to a final integration time tf of 200 days since january 2020 this amounts to double the time interval in the recorded data in 29 and allows for predictions for up to 100 days after january 2020obviously what is important when studying the spread of a virus is the number of deaths d and recoveries r in time as these numbers are not provided directly by the sir model 1 we estimated them by first plotting the data for deaths dd vs the removals rmd where rmdddrditotdid and then fitting the plotted data with the nonlinear function3dd01ekrmwhere d
0 and k are constants estimated by the non-linear fitting the function is expressed in terms of only model values and is fitted to the curve of the data thus having obtained d from the non-linear fitting the number of recoveries r can be described in time by the simple observation that it is given by the scaled removals rm from the sir model 1 less the number of deaths d from eq 34rrmd
the number of infections peaked in china about 16 february 2020 and since then it has slowly decreased the decrease only occurs when the susceptible population numbers decrease and this decrease in susceptible numbers only occurred through the drastic actions taken by the chinese government china quarantined and confirmed potential patients and restricted citizens movements as well as international travel social distancing was widely practiced and most of the people wore face masks the actual numbers of infections have decreased at a greater rate than predicted by the sir model see figs 1 and 2 our results in figs 1 and 2 provide evidence that the chinese government has done well in limiting the impact of the spread of covid-19from the plots shown in figs 3 and 4 it is obvious that the south korean government has done a wonderful job in controlling the spread of the virus the country has implemented an extensive virus testing program there has also been a heavy use of surveillance technology closed-circuit television cctv and tracking of bank cards and mobile phone usage to identify who to test in the first place south korea has achieved a low fatality rate currently one percent without resorting to such authoritarian measures as in china the most conspicuous part of the south korean strategy is simple enough implementation of repeated cycles of test and contact trace measuresto match the recorded data from india with predictions from the sir model 1 it is necessary to include a number of surge periods as shown in fig 5 this is because the sir model cannot predict accurately the peak number of infections if the actual numbers in the infected population have not peaked in time it is most likely the spread of the virus as of early june 2020 is not contained and there will be an increasing number of total infections however by adding new surge periods a higher and delayed peak can be predicted and compared with future data in fig 5 a consequence of the surge periods is that the peak is delayed and higher than if no surge periods were applied the model predictions for the 30 september 2020 including the surges are 330 000 total infections 700 active infections and 7 500 deaths whereas if there were no surge periods there would be 130 000 total infections 700 active infections and 6 300 deaths with the peak of 60 000 which is about 40 of the current number of active cases occuring around 20 may 2020 thus the model can still give a rough estimate of future infections and deaths as well as the time it may take for the number of infections to drop to safer levels at which time restrictions can be eased even without an accurate prediction in the peak in active infections see figs 5 and 6a surge in the susceptible population was applied in early march 2020 in the country the surge was caused by 2 700 passengers disembarking from the ruby princes cruise ship in sydney and then returning to their homes around australia more than 750 passengers and crew have become infected and 26 died two government enquires have been established to investigate what went wrong also at this time many infected overseas passengers arrived by air from europe and the usa the australian government was too slow in quarantining arrivals from overseasfrom mid-march 2020 until mid-may 2020 the australian governments introduced measures of testing contact tracing social distancing staying at home policy closure of many businesses and encouraging people to work from home from figs 7 and 8 it can be observed that actions taken were successful as the actual number of infections declined in accord with the model predictions there have been no further surge periods from end of may 2020 these restrictions are being removed in stages the sir model can be used when future data becomes available to see if the number of susceptible individuals starts to increase if so the model can accommodate this by introducing surge factorsas of early june 2020 the peak number of infections has not been reached when a peak in the data is not reached it is more difficult to fit the model predictions to the data in the model it is necessary to add a few surge periods this is because new epicentres of the virus arose at different times the virus started spreading in washington state followed by california new york chicago and the southern states of the usa the need to add surge periods shows clearly that the spread of the virus is not under controlin the usa by the end of may 2020 the number of active infected cases has not yet peaked and the cumulative total number of infections keeps getting bigger this can be accounted for in the sir model by considering how the susceptible population changes with time in may during that time to match the data to the model predictions surge periods were used where the normalized susceptible population s was reset to 02 every four days what is currently happening in the usa is that as susceptible individuals become infected their population decreases with these infected individuals mixing with the general population leading to an increase in the susceptible population this is shown in the model by the variable for the susceptible population s varying from about 006 to 020 repeatedly during may until this vicious cycle is broken the cumulative total infected population will keep growing at a steady rate and not reach an almost steady-state the fluctuating normalized susceptible variable provides clear evidence that government authorities do not have the spread of the virus under control see figs 9 and 10the plots in figs 11 and 12 show that the peak in the total cumulative number of infections has not been reached as early as june however the peak is probably not far away if there are no surges in the susceptible population then one could expect that by late september 2020 the number of infections will have fallen to very small numbers and the virus will have been well under control with the total number of deaths in the order of 2 000 in mid-may 2020 some restrictions have been lifted in the state of texas the sir model can be used to model some of the possible scenarios if the early relaxation of restrictions leads to increasing number of susceptible populations if there is a relatively small increase in the future number of susceptible individuals no series impacts occur however if there is a large outbreak of the virus then the impacts can be dramatic for example at the end of june 2020 if s was reset to 08 s08 a second wave of infections occurs with the peak number of infections occurring near the end of july with the second wave peak being higher than the initial peak number of infections subsequently the number of deaths will rise from about 2 000 to nearly 5 000 as shown in figs 13 and 14if governments start lifting their containment strategies too quickly then it is probable there will be a second wave of infections with a larger peak in active cases resulting to many more deaths
figure 15 shows clearly that the peak of the pandemic has been reached in italy and without further surge periods the spread of the virus is contained and number of active cases is declining rapidly the plots in panels a b in fig 16 are a check on how well the model can predict the time evolution of the virus these plots also assist in selecting the models input parametersthe term flattening the curve has rapidly become a rallying cry in the fight against covid-19 popularised by the media and government officials claims have been made that flattening the curve results in i reduction in the peak number of cases thereby helping to prevent the health system from being overwhelmed and ii in an increase in the duration of the pandemic with the total burden of cases remaining the same this implies that social distancing measures and management of cases with their devastating economic and social impacts may need to continue for much longer the picture which has been widely shown in the media is shown in fig 17athe idea presented in the media as shown in fig 17a is that by flattening the curve the peak number of infections will decrease however the total number of infections will be the same and the duration of the pandemic will be longer hence they concluded that by flattening the curve it will have a lesser impact upon the demands in hospitals figure 17b gives the scientific meaning of flattening the curve by governments imposing appropriate measures the number of susceptible individuals can be reduced and combined with isolating infected individuals will reduce the peak number of infections when this is done it actually shortens the time the virus impacts the society thus the second claim has no scientific basis and is incorrect what is important is reducing the peak in the number of infections and when this is done it shortens the duration in which drastic measures need to be taken and not lengthen the period as stated in the media and by government officials figure 17 shows that the peak number of infections actually reduces the duration of the impact of the virus on a communitymathematical modelling theories are effective tools to deal with the time evolution and patterns of disease outbreaks they provide us with useful predictions in the context of the impact of intervention in decreasing the number of infected-susceptible incidence rates 30 31 32in this work we have augmented the classic sir model with the ability to accommodate surges in the number of susceptible individuals supplemented by recorded data from china south korea india australia usa and the state of texas to provide insights into the spread of covid-19 in communities in all cases the model predictions could be fitted to the published data reasonably well with some fits better than others for china the actual number of infections fell more rapidly than the model prediction which is an indication of the success of the measures implemented by the chinese government there was a jump in the number of deaths reported in mid-april in china which results in a less robust estimate of the number of deaths predicted by the sir model the susceptible population dropped to zero very quickly in south korea showing that the government was quick to act in controlling the spread of the virus as of the beginning of june 2020 the peak number of infections in india has not yet been reached therefore the model predictions give only minimum estimates of the duration of the pandemic in the country the total cumulative number of infections and deaths the case study of the virus in australia shows the importance of including a surge where the number of susceptible individuals can be increased this surge can be linked to the arrival of infected individuals from overseas and infected people from the ruby princess cruise ship the data from usa is an interesting example since there are multiple epicentres of the virus that arise at different times this makes it more difficult to select appropriate model parameters and surges where the susceptible population is adjusted the results for texas show that the model can be applied to communities other than countries italy provides an example where there is excellent agreement between the published data and model predictionsthus our sir model provides a theoretical framework to investigate the spread of the covid-19 virus within communities the model can give insights into the time evolution of the spread of the virus that the data alone does not in this context it can be applied to communities given reliable data are available its power also lies to the fact that as new data are added to the model it is easy to adjust its parameters and provide with best-fit curves between the data and the predictions from the model it is in this context then it can provide with estimates of the number of likely deaths in the future and time scales for decline in the number of infections in communities our results show that the sir model is more suitable to predict the epidemic trend due to the spread of the disease as it can accommodate surges and be adjusted to the recorded data by comparing the published data with predictions it is possible to predict the success of government interventions the considered data are taken in between january and june 2020 that contains the datasets before and during the implementation of strict and control measures our analysis also confirms the success and failures in some countries in the control measures takenstrict adequate measures have to be implemented to further prevent and control the spread of covid-19 countries around the world have taken steps to decrease the number of infected citizens such as lock-down measures awareness programs promoted via media hand sanitization campaigns etc to slow down the transmission of the disease additional measures including early detection approaches and isolation of susceptible individuals to avoid mixing them with no-symptoms and self-quarantine individuals traffic restrictions and medical treatment have shown they can help to prevent the increase in the number of infected individuals strong lockdown policies can be implemented in different areas if possible in line with this necessary public health policies have to be implemented in countries with high rates of covid-19 cases as early as possible to control its spread the sir model used here is only a simple one and thus the predictions that come out might not be accurate enough something that also depends on the published data and their trustworthiness however as the model data show one thing that is certain is that covid-19 is not going to go way quickly or easilyi am attaching herewith a copy of our manuscript

disruptions across the globe budds 2020 saadat rawtani  hussain 2020 moreover the digital world is fragile regarding cyberattacks this could be a teachable moment to apply lessons from the cybersecurity world to protect our built environment during the covid-19 pandemic the coronavirus is quickly spreading and causes significant damage mimicking the spread of computer viruses within a network kindervag 2020 in the digital world it is common practice to design and incorporate solutions that can help overcome virus attacks for every new generation a new security layer is added to ensure the ever-mutating computer viruses do not harm the digital structure ahlefeldt 2020 could policymakers planners and architects inspired by the digital world learn from its cybersecurity to make our built environment more resistant to the virus could we design and build our cities to stop the virus from spreading if so could we install an antivirus-built environment ready to help in the protection from coronavirus or other pandemicsinfectious disease has already transformed our places through architecture design and urban planning previously many trends in architecture and urbanism that we see today were derived from similar measures taken before to ensure the health hygiene and comfort of urban residents our built environment has always exhibited the capacity to evolve after the crisis chang 2020 dejtiar 2020 muggah  ermacora 2020 this study encourages the search for suitable design ideas trends and planning theories to provide the required protection from virus attacks and continue to add more layers in the defense system of our built environment to cope with this pandemic professionals in architecture urban planning sectors and design agencies have already switched their focus to visualize the post-pandemic era however there is inadequate research conducted to imagine how the antivirus-built environment would look to address this gap this study reviews architecture and urban story developments from the past centuries we then review research areas affected by the covid-19 pandemic and highlight their related questions we then analyze the social distancing and quarantine as a design problem in the post-pandemic era subsequently some lessons learned from the pandemic are presented to visualize and introduce the studys vision about the antivirus-built environmentin the 14th century the bubonic plague motivated the fundamental urban improvements of the renaissance cities cleared overcrowded living quarters expanded their margins developed early quarantine facilities and opened large public spaces in the 20th century infectious disease was one of the drivers of urban renewal modernist architects saw design as a cure to the sickness of overcrowded cities where tuberculosis typhoid polio and spanish flu breakouts encouraged urban planning slum clearance tenement reform and waste management chang 2020 lubell 2020during the industrial era cholera and typhoid influenced the sanitary reform movement these epidemics contributed to developing water and sewage systems to fight the pathogens eventually leading to a sanitary innovation and required the streets to be straighter smoother and wider to install underground pipe systems furthermore the third plague pandemic in 1855 changed the design of everything from drainpipes to door thresholds and building foundations budds 2020 klaus 2020 wainwright 2020the wipe-clean esthetic of modernism can be partially attributed to tuberculosis the modern architectural designs were inspired by an era of purity of form strict geometries modern materials and a rejection of ornamentation modernist architects designed these curative environments as cleansed physically and symbolically from disease and pollution beyond their esthetic appeal these features embodied modernist preoccupations with the healing effects of light air and nature these buildings included large windows balconies flat surfaces that would not collect dust and white paint emphasizing the appearance of cleanliness budds 2020 chang 2020 against this background the current health crisis should develop our built environment to increase the security layers that help to prevent the spread of infections and diseases in this context there are multiple areas of research needed regarding covid-19when the world health organization who declared the fast-spreading covid-19 as a pandemic citizens around the globe hastened to go home this global pandemic significantly influenced our personal and professional lives and has a direct bearing upon the very foundations of urban planning and architecture theory and practice allam  jones 2020 haleem javaid vaishya  deshmukh 2020 saadat et al 2020 consequently the pandemic has led to questions of how architects and planners could present and install antivirus-related ideas or update the existing spaces as well as at what stage can the pandemic affect our physical and built environment to extend the scope of research needed from the academic community table 1
reviews certain required research areas affected by covid-19 and highlights their related questions professional and extensive research is required on all levels and scales in these areas to prevent the virus from spreading the answers to these questions could help in predicting the post-pandemic style and visualizing the required antivirus systemsince most humans spend most of their daily lives inside the built environment it is essential to understand the potential transmission dynamics of infection as individuals move through the built environment covid-19 can be transmitted both by air and via direct and indirect contact viral particles can be directly deposited on surfaces or suspended due to natural and mechanical airflow patterns or other sources of turbulence in the indoor environment dietz et al 2020 horve et al 2020 the who has prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 15 or 2 m about 6 feet to minimize the risk of infection however more recently published studies support the hypothesis of virus transmission over 2 m from an infected person bourouiba 2020 setti et al 2020 in addition oklahoma state university researchers simulated different environmental and movement conditions to see if a six-foot social distancing policy is enough their results indicate this policy is enough if the ambient air is static oklahoma state university 2020 other factors and wearing protective clothes affect the transmission dynamics of infection however who is continuously changing and updating all the mentioned distances based on the latest information and researches conducted by professionalsthe pandemic has brought a greater sense of appreciation for our homes people need houses that can effectively provide social isolation and offer protection from viruses and infections the expectation is that even after the quarantine period more people will work from home consequently the future of home design might change dejtiar 2020 kashdan 2020

resistant to the concept of remote working have been forced to allow working from home however working from home all the time is not for everyone many will want to return to their physical offices as the pandemic continues or remote working becomes the new norm office space might have to be altered to create greater spacing and fewer seating options marr 2020 molla 2020 based on this transformation the density in offices might probably change and firms will not need more space because of work from home policies consequently high-rise buildings would become more expensive to build and become less efficient depending on how productive remote work proves to be in this pandemic it is hastening the shift from structured office environments to more flexible virtual and home-based work arrangements which could mean a reversal of the open-office trend and the search for better other natural ventilation and healthy design options alter 2020 muggah  ermacora 2020 regarding cleaning policies certain firms could even use ultraviolet germicidal irradiation to deeply disinfect offices at night or meeting rooms between uses a practice that is increasingly common in hospitals to combat the spread of infection beggs et al 2000 kovach et al 2017 molla 2020to accommodate work from home situations we could even reexamine old urban typologies many urban approaches might increase the protection and defense system of our cities and avoid high density and overcrowding policymakers and planners should use the current crisis to review planning theories and based on the results they should take a step back in searching about how past cities are structured
expanding horizontally during a pandemic the human proximity of heavily populated cities poses further risks the larger the population the higher the concentration of covid-19 in cities regarding the impact of social distancing planners and architects might design according to expanding horizontally approaches with more available open spaces which could be essential to prevent the spread of infections and diseases liu 2020 novakovic 2020
fewer density cities because social distancing measures are essential to the containment effort some have blamed the density of cities for the rapid spread of the infection and considered suburbs to be the safest places urbanization might take a step back to enhance villages and city suburbs particularly with the increased acceptance of digital transformation makhno 2020 nicola et al 2020 wainwright 2020 however the impacts of higher density on social interactions and sustainability are still controversial issues mousavinia pourdeihimi  madani 2019

shows the proposed vision about how nature and advanced technology approaches help in visualizing antivirus-built environments to stop the virus from spreading however selecting the best antivirus strategy depends on many factors posing new challenges to choose that could be used or planned as long-term reforms we must be proactive not reactive and continue to update this antivirus-enabled paradigm and install new approaches within its framework many questions still require further multidisciplinary studies this study does not present answers it originates insights for areas where future research will be critically required to update the proposed visionthe proposed vision in this study does not have an expiration date when the covid-19 pandemic ended most of healthy architecture and urban approaches could be applicable to the pandemics to come we could imagine all housing buildings as self-sufficient independent and healthy neighborhoods and making smart use of the available technologies it is crucial to make urban areas more resilient to emergencies response to face epidemics and other possible future emergencies of every kindthere is no end in sight to the covid-19 pandemic but it has helped us predict what post-pandemic architecture and urbanism might look like although we are not going to overhaul how we have been building architecture and cities before based on the current circumstances and emergency measures we should review our design strategies and planning theories we could more effectively use healthy design and planning strategies to face pandemics and create a less pullulated more sustainable architecture and urbanism in general moreover if we harnessed the security layers not only to prevent ever-mutating virus attacks but a healing approach that could be implemented in the post-pandemic era it could help build a sustainable environment therefore is this transformation in our physical and built environment a temporary reaction or the new normal with spread of the covid-19 pandemic additional questions will undoubtedly arise and additional security layers should be added to update an antivirus-enabled paradigm this study does not present answers it only provides insights for areas where future research will be critically required to extend the scope of research required based on the lessons learned from this crisis this study introduces a vision about the required antivirus-built environment that can be updated to stop the virus spreading or mitigate its impacts however selecting the best antivirus strategy depends on many factors such as the abilities and capabilities of each community and environment the global pandemic has highlighted the limitations of how we manage our built environment regarding how we should design build and run our built environment however it has given us a chance to learn nevertheless certain questions remain such as will we regard these unique lessons if so we should think more specifically about the benefits of this forced experimentation and implement further developments to select which could be used or planned as long-term reforms from a transformative viewpoint in this context the pandemic increased the requirement for policymakers planners and architects to think more out of the box trying to reshape our physical spaces and reset the existing build environment or develop more ideas to face future virus attacks these changes give us a glimpse at how our cities could change for the better and the worse in the long-term however it is too early to judge how responses to covid-19 will affect design and urbanism theories these results call for urgent efforts to further explore our built environment and not wait for another pandemic to serve as a reminder this approach must be parallel to other sustainable approaches embracing not impinging natural resources and not harming our environment if we can manage that our present architecture and cities will continue to serve us well however the post-pandemic era will see multiple challenges that require a better understanding of covid-19 and its socioeconomic effects on society the future remains uncertain and thus future multidisciplinary studies are requiredthe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest
at the turn of the twenty-first century
 public health officials began to notice an increase in the number of human infections with highly pathogenic avian h5n1 influenza virus originating from birds in close proximity to people the possibility of influenza pandemics is always a concern but this zoonotic jump seemed particularly worrisome because the case fatality rate cfr was approximately 60 fortunately the virus did not acquire mammalian transmissibility and there were no confirmed examples of human-to-human spread nevertheless there was great concern that if the virus did acquire human transmissibility and maintained such a high cfr the world could face a public health emergency of unprecedented danger for comparison the cfr during the 1918 influenza epidemic  which many believe to be the worst influenza pandemic in history was approximately 25another development in the mid-2000s was the creation in the usa of the national science advisory board for biosecurity nsabb whose charge was to advise the us government on so-called dual-use problem in biomedical research research being performed with beneficial goals in mind but the results of which could be misused for nefarious purposes the nsabb delved into the dual-use controversy early in its tenure when the us government asked it to review the paper describing the reconstruction of the influenza virus strain responsible for the 1918 epidemic 1 although the nsabb voted to recommend publication the editor of science made it clear that the journal would have published the article irrespective of the nsabb vote unless the paper was classified 2 for the next half decade the nsabb struggled with the problem of how to deal with dual-use research in the biological sciences and proposed identifying a small subset of science known as dual-use research of concern or durc as that domain on which to focus effortswhile the nsabb was formulating durc definitions and devising recommendations two laboratories set out to experimentally test whether h5n1 virus could become transmissible in what is thought to be the best animal model for such studies the ferret research groups led by yoshi kawaoka in the usa and ron fouchier in the netherlands took similar approaches albeit with different starting strains first engineering the ability of the virus to bind to human receptors and then serially passaging it through ferrets both obtained the same answer the h5n1 virus could attain the ability to be transmitted via respiratory droplets they wrote manuscripts and submitted them for publication in nature and science respectively 3 4 in late 2011 the nsabb had the opportunity to evaluate its policies and recommendations when the us government learned of the two submitted manuscripts describing these high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses hpaiv  that had been made mammalian transmissible it asked the nsabb to advise it whether publication was wise given potential biosecurity concerns the details of the deliberations of the nsabb and its ultimate decision to recommend publication have been described in detail elsewhere but briefly the nsabb determined that the benefits of the research outweighed the biosecurity risks 5 hence the first round of the controversy was focused primarily on biosecurity issuesafter the 2012 decision on the two influenza papers the situation quieted for a couple of years until a series of biosafety lapses at us government laboratories at the cdc and the nih received rekindled interest on the problem these laboratory incidents received a high degree of public attention spearheaded by the reporting of alison young at usa today this conjunction of laboratory accidents together with additional follow-up publications eg 6 puts the h5n1 story in a new light namely whether similar experiments in which new phenotypes are added to pathogens gain-of-function gof studies could be conducted safely and whether they should be pursued at all confronted with a public outcry combined with a serious scientific debate on the benefits and risks of gof-type experiments in 2014 the nih which has administrative responsibility for the nsabb imposed a moratorium on us-funded gof experiments with pathogens of pandemic potential ppp those being influenza virus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus mers-cov  while sars-cov had disappeared from the human population due to a highly successful public health containment endeavor the mers-cov outbreak had emerged in the middle east and was and still is ongoing at the time the us government also charged the nsabb with making recommendations about the future of gof research httpswwwphegovs3dualusedocumentsgain-of-functionpdf we have summarized the events of 2014 in a series of papers and those details will not be recounted here 7 8 instead our focus will be to make the case for the scientific and moral value of gof-type research provided that it can be conducted safely hence the second round of the controversy was focused less on biosecurity and intentional release and almost entirely on biosafetywe have previously argued that the h5n1 experiments and similar gof studies provide benefits at many levels from the practical to the epistemological 9 10 some tangible benefits of gof studies involving influenza virus includethe results of gof experiments can be definitive for example the 2012 gof studies showing that hpaiv could acquire the capacity for mammalian transmissibility established that these influenza viruses had the biological capacity to emerge as a contagious human pathogen prior to these studies it was not clear whether the absence of human transmissibility in the isolated cases of hpaiv was a result of a biological limitation in the ability of the virus to be mammalian transmissible or just a stochastic effect such that the necessary mutations had not occurred the 2012 gof studies unequivocally established the capacity of these hpaiv for mammalian transmission which in turn implies pandemic potential to our knowledge there are no other experiments or analysis that could have provided such definitive information hence these experiments provide a warning to humanity of the dangers posed by these hpaiv strains and suggest that similar dangers lurk in other influenza strains in this regard similar experiments have shown that h7n1 has the capacity of mammalian transmissibility 11 extending the threat horizon to h7 virusesthe results of gof experiments can inform on important biological questions for example gof experiments yielded mutants that when analyzed showed that higher and lower ph optima for the hemagglutinin were associated with enhanced virulence in birds and mammals respectively 12 this information is important for knowing how influenza viruses jump from birds to humans which is a critical step in the emergence of new pandemic strainsgof experiments can be used to produce new viral strains to improve vaccine production one of the hurdles in vaccine preparation is the adaptation and growth of vaccination strains in eggs for efficient production gof-type of experiments can be used to identify mutations that facilitate replication of influenza strains in eggs and this information could facilitate vaccine production 13
are there other claimed benefits that have been derived from the h5n1 studies at the time of publication the authors and others argued that the results would inform surveillance efforts and vaccine development it is unclear to us how much surveillance has benefitted although the mutation information has been used in monitoring 14 15 as we and others have pointed out there is a danger of focusing on the exact mutations discovered in the ferret experiments because there may be other genetic routes to human transmissibility 10 some have noted that by the time such mutations have been detected in avian populations it might be too late to stop the spread due to the relative rates with which we can identify those mutations using current technology and the rate of spread of influenza virus 16 17 increased awareness of the threat of h5n1 however must certainly have led to better isolation of patients who have been exposed to the virus in this regard it seems reasonable to assume that any onward transmission of an avian strain would occur largely in the healthcare setting as has been the case with sars-cov and mers-cov and rapid intervention could prevent a widespread outbreakwhile monitoring the mutations discovered in the laboratory from gof experiments is not sufficient to predict dangers from environmental isolates it is important to note that while both groups obtained viruses with different mutations they both achieved similar phenotypes of enhanced stability of the ha protein  as our ability to predict phenotype from genotype improves this becomes increasingly important a big caveat to overstating the importance of this however is the contribution of epistasis to any given phenotype for example the same mutations identified by the fouchier group when introduced into a different h5n1 background yielded a different ha phenotype 18 this implies that insights gained from one set of mutations in one strain are unlikely to be generalizable to other strains given sequence differences hence with the hindsight of half a decade of work since the original controversy in 2012 it appears that gof-type experiments are very informative with regard to big questions such as whether mammalian virulence and transmissibility potential exists in hpaiv but may be less useful in making fine-scale molecular predictionsas mentioned above in 2014 the us government mandated a moratorium on gof-type experiments involving ppp such as influenza mers-cov and sars-cov  to the best of our knowledge us-supported experiments to examine changes in transmission of avian influenza viruses have largely stopped the fouchier lab did publish a follow-up report to their original science manuscript in which they narrowed down the exact mutations that enabled transmission in the ferret model but based on the publication date it appears that this work was completed prior to the moratorium 19 in the mers-cov field the development of a small animal model that faithfully reproduces human transmission and disease has been slowed significantly by the moratorium mers-cov uses the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 protein as a receptor and the human and murine proteins differ enough such that the virus cannot use the mouse molecule transgenic mice that express human dpp4 ubiquitously experience a broader set of symptoms than do humans when infected with wild-type mers-cov 2023 this problem was recently overcome by developing a transgenic mouse expressing a mutant dpp4 in which two key amino acids were mutated from the mouse allele to the human allele however the authors still needed to passage the virus through these transgenic mice to derive a gof variant that recapitulated human disease 24 this gof virus was subsequently used to show the efficacy of a promising nucleotide prodrug originally initially developed for ebola virus for treating mers 25 continuing efforts to produce a mouse-adapted mers-cov in wild-type mice have been prohibited 26 r baric personal communicationthe question remains how does society at large and the scientific community and regulatory agencies in particular weigh the risks and benefits the difficulty lies largely in trying to apply quantitative risk assessment measures to the problem the benefits of all biological research not just gof research often do not make themselves apparent until years or even decades after the experiments are performed on the other hand the risks even when theoretical manifest themselves in the present when the experimentation is done fortunately we have not had real examples of laboratory accidents leading to significant morbidity or mortality the 1977 reintroduction of h1n1 into human circulation has been attributed to a laboratory mishap although not all agree since other explanations are possible 2729 as discussed below some authorities have presented worst-case scenarios based on hypothetical calculations whereas others have used similar types of data to come up with numbers at the extreme opposite end of the spectrum arguing that the likelihood of such events is extremely lowperhaps the greatest benefit of this controversy has been an increased attention to biosafety when working with dangerous pathogens in 2014 the nih proposed a biosafety stewardship month as a means to promote increased attention to biosafety and many institutions took advantage of this opportunity indeed while it can be misleading to draw strong conclusions from the absence of events the types of events that found their way into the news media earlier in this decade seem to have decreased significantly another benefit of the controversy was that it has stimulated efforts to gain comparable information in systems that do pose the same biosafety or biosecurity risks as working on the wild-type virus for example a recent study reporting that only three mutations were needed to switch h7n9 tropism to human cells was performed using an attenuated virus 30the first concern is the potential for misuse of any information or product generated by gof research by bad actors the worry here is that once the results of gof studies are published bad actors could replicate the work for nefarious purposes such as a terrorist attack such concerns were expressed for example in connection with the aforementioned 2012 publication of studies of engineered avian flu virus transmissibility in ferret models 5 3 4 as noted above the question whether to permit publication was considered by the nsabb which eventually allowed publication judging that the risk of misuse was outweighed by the potential benefitsthis is neither the first nor the last occasion on which questions have been raised about the risks of dual-use research with examples ranging far beyond biomedical research to include such technologies as unmanned aerial vehicles being used as weapons and hacking being used for the stuxnet cyberattack cyberwarfare tools can be used to enhance national security by disarming opponents while at the same time finding employment in crime such as occurred recently when the leaked national security agency code was used in spring 2017 for global ransomware attackssuch misuse of gof research is certainly possible but one serious problem in an ethical evaluation of possible misuse is the difficulty of estimating the likelihood and potential impact of misuse one can imagine numerous different scenarios involving everyone from major state actors and non-state terrorist organizations to freelance mischief-makers working in a home basement lab there is no way to quantify over so many possibilities let alone to assay systematically the effects that such a diverse array of actors might achievethe misuse concern is further complicated by the fact that the cost and complexity of using relevant tools such as crisprcas9  continues to decline making ever easier the replication of even unpublished research indeed the risks of the democratization of crisprcas9 technology go well beyond gof research and there has been a call for a much more concerted international public debate about monitoring and possibly regulating access to some of those tools see 31given these difficulties what is the responsible way for gof researchers to proceed with respect to potential misuse this is a place where prudence might be a better guide than cost-benefit analysis thus one notes that for the researchers own safety gof research with especially dangerous pathogens must be done in labs with very high biosafety standards at least biosafety level bsl -3 that means that except for the rare suicidal individual such research will only be feasible in countries with the necessary biosafety facilities and protocols and the list of such facilities today includes mostly nations with proven records of responsible research conduct nations which also have the technical expertise to conduct such research entirely on their own of course one could imagine a nation like north korea aspiring to a bioweapon capability and as they have demonstrated with their successes in offensive cyber operations ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons there is no lack of technical talent in north koreafor all of these reasons the risk of publication of gof research related to misuse of biotechnology seems to have receded from the forefront of concern in addition the scientific publishing community is much more aware of these issues and many journals have instituted internal reviews for papers that include durc eg 32 33 the more prominent worry today is about accidently unleashing the very kind of global pandemic that one was seeking to preventa number of critics have argued that the risk of inadvertently creating a global pandemic through accidental release of an engineered human-transmissible pathogen with high virulence and case fatality rate vastly outweighs any benefits that might be obtained from such research eg 34 thus one source claims a 001 to 01 probability per year of research in a bsl-3 lab of an accidental release of highly transmissible influenza virus that would kill between 200000 and 16 million people 35 36 if this is a reliable estimate thats a scary prospect on the other hand one of the authors of the original h5n1 studies has calculated the risks to be much much lower 37given a claimed risk on that high a scale how shall we think about the balance between benefit and risk first we must ask some tough questions about the risk analysis itself many factors go into such an analysis including historical data on accidental exposure in bsl-3 and bsl-4 labs and simulation studies of disease spread after accidental exposure we consider each of these factors separatelyto date only one reasonably sophisticated simulation study for the spread of a potentially pandemic influenza virus has been reported 38 this is the study cited by lipsitch and inglesbsy 35 36 the researchers who conducted the simulation study had to make many assumptions about such variables as virulence case fatality rate latency time demographics geography response capabilities of public health authorities and monitoring of lab personnel for symptoms of exposure the simulation model was robust against variations in many of these parameters but there were considerable differences in outcome with some variations such as early detection of initial exposure still on the whole the numbers are grim with the right combination of factors it is theoretically possible for an accidental release to wreak havoc that brings us to the question of how probable such a catastrophic event is and the science of risk-benefit analysisthe other major component of the risk calculationthe chance of accidental exposure or releaseis generally estimated on the basis of historical data which with its foibles is far less robust the spate of accidents in us bsl-3 labs a few years ago rightly aroused concern among experts but also generated in the public mind a perception of risk that might not accurately represent the current state of affairs after more stringent monitoring and review procedures were implemented the annual rate of accidental exposure today could easily be ten to one hundred times smaller than it appeared to be in 2013 of course 200000 to 16 million deaths per lab year is still reason for worry but then there are other factors to consider the reported accidental exposures aggregate data on all organisms that require high levels of biosafety containment none of those cases involved gof research and given the attention being paid to gof by comparison with research on say natural pathogens it is not at all clear that we can reasonably extrapolate from the historical data on accidental exposure to the risk of accidental exposure or release in gof researchthere are still deeper problems with a cost-benefit approach to assess the ethics of gof research first assessing the risk of accidental release and an attendant global pandemic is only one small part of a more comprehensive cost-benefit analysis which must always compare the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action proponents of gof research argue that it can play a crucial role in preventing or lessening the effects of a global pandemic by enabling mitigation factors such as early detection and the rapid development of vaccines one obvious additional risk then is the risk of a global pandemic that might have been prevented or mitigated by continuing gof research that risk is even more difficult to quantify than the risk of pandemic through accidental release still it must be part of a comprehensive analysis and since its major consequence eg a global pandemic is just as severe as a pandemic caused by accidental release such a scenario would loom just as large as the accidental release scenario in a thorough cost-benefit analysisanother deep problem with conventional cost-benefit analyses is that they usually do not include the intrinsic benefit of new knowledge 9 one might think that knowledge is something too ephemeral to be quantified or one might argue that if knowledge counts as a benefit it does so only through the consequences of such knowledge for human flourishing which means that it does enter our calculations indirectly though measures of the costs and benefits of human health and human suffering one does not want to indulge uncritically in the mantra of knowledge for knowledges own sake a trope that has too often been used to justify research but the fact remains that on the whole increased knowledge brings increased ability to promote the good and to mitigate suffering new knowledge can always be used for evil ends but how we use that knowledge is a moral choice and if we dont have that knowledge in the first place then we cannot use it for the good exactly how new knowledge will contribute to future human flourishing in a complex and rapidly changing technical and social world is usually unforeseeable at the time when the new knowledge is first generated technology ethicist shannon vallor dubs this the problem of technosocial opacity 39 thus it would seem impossible to include the long-term effects of new knowledge production in a cost-benefit analysis of the research generating that knowledge the only way to fairly assess the benefits of such research is to put a premium on knowledge production per se how to do that is the hard problem and that difficulty must be added to the list of reasons suggesting that cost-benefit analysis is a seriously limited tool for policymaking about scientific researchperhaps the deepest problem with the cost-benefit approach to policymaking is what we have termed elsewhere the apocalyptic fallacy 40 imagining an unintentional global pandemic as one possible outcome of gof research is tantamount to assigning infinite negative utility to such research in a cost-benefit analysis thus it makes no difference how low the probability of such an outcome might be infinite negative utility multiplied by any finite probability totally swamps every other term in a cost-benefit analysis meaning that no imagined benefits of alternative courses of action however great excepting eternal salvation for all of humankind can make a difference in the calculation what this means is that cost-benefit analysis is effectively useless in such settings at least with regard to the moral assessment of something like gof research if cost-benefit analysis is the epitome of reason and rationality in policymaking then reason fails us in cases where the risks include the extermination of a significant fraction of all human lifenevertheless there is still value in risk analysis as the above-cited simulation study of disease spread after accidental exposure and release amply demonstrates a careful risk analysis can point us toward those factors that are critical for minimizing risk such as enhanced biosafety protocols and rapid public health responses but when promoted to the public and policymakers as forecasting a doomsday scenario such analyses risk inducing panic that overwhelms practical reasonsimilarly comparisons of the risks of gof research to the events leading to the development of the nuremberg code do not serve a useful purpose in the discussion 34 the use of the word nuremberg connotes an association with war crimes that is simply inappropriate for use in a rational discussion about experiments that are ostensibly being done by well-meaning scientists trying to prepare humanity for confronting a potential pandemic although we are well aware that the nuremberg code and the war crimes of the high echelons of the nazi hierarchy are very different things the problem lies in the symbolism of the phrase and how it may be perceived by the public we urge that it not be used and in fact it is possible to discuss these important principles without invoking the name of the city with its historical baggageif cost-benefit analysis is not the optimal tool for policymaking with respect to gof research what is earlier we mentioned the virtue of simple prudence in thinking about dual-use research and technology perhaps that is the answer here as well technology ethicists have given the name precautionary principlepolicymakers prefer sophisticated names like thisto the homespun idea of prudence but prudence is really a simple idea familiar to us all it means think before you act and do not act if you are not sufficiently secure in thinking that you will do more good than harm thinking before acting should include risk analysis in settings such as gof research but a risk analysis is not the end of clear thinking it is only the beginningwhere does this leave us one major conclusion is this for almost every form of human activity there is a nonvanishing probability of catastrophic outcomes any casual individual act could set in motion a chain of events that would lead to the rise of the next world war this is highly improbable but possible and the consequences would be cataclysmic outweighing any imaginable good that might derive from that action therefore the precautionary principle would suggest that we do nothing but doing nothing can equally well engender a sequence of events leading to human extinction we conclude therefore one should act this dilemma highlights a fatal contradiction lurking within any attempt to rationally assess actions that might entrain consequences with infinite negative utility via cost-benefit analysishow otherwise should we proceed this is not a hard question think about both risks and benefits take obvious precautions and then make the prudent choice with enhanced biosafety protocols and improvements in the public health response we should not ban gof research but monitor it the relevant research communities should insist upon stringent norms for the conduct of the research and in safety protocols provided that these conditions are met there is no obvious reason why gof type of experimentation should not go forwardthe more knowledge we accumulate the more ignorance we produce ignorance  in spite of its prevalence in human affairs and profound consequences  receives little attention outside the philosophical dialogue about knowledge production proctor 2008 2008 in this commentary about the publics response to the outbreak of the covid19 in the united states and western europe we explore the transpacific and transatlantic production of ignorance from the authors experiences and observation in california and belgium respectivelyas migrant chinese academics in social sciences caught up in the fight against the sarscov2 virus in china and countries where we live  belgium and the united states  we are distressed and worried for family and friends back at home in china and in our adopted home countries we feel being stuck between a rock and a hard place we are critical of the chinese state and its various policies in our own research thus try our best to sift through myriad information about chinas response coming from within and outside china in order to distinguish between the applicable public health lessons and chinas ideologydriven propaganda yet to our own surprise we frequently find ourselves on the defensive due mainly to the ignorance surrounding the measures taken by the chinese authorities to contain the pandemic and china in general such ignorance we believe prevents constructive debates on useful lessons to be learnt and reforms needed to improve the public health system within and beyond china this crisis has been exploited to accumulate political capital contributing to the escalation of racial conflicts and intensification of geopolitical tensions it is also detrimental to building trust and organising global collective action which is desperately needed to control the pandemicin this commentary we aim to dissect the ignorance as we have observed and experienced we will start with a brief introduction of proctors 2008 2008 insight into agnotology  the study of ignorance this is followed first by a close reading of a selection of articles and commentaries published by journalists and researchers in mass media in the event of a pandemic anxiety and fear can drive people to overconsume information about the virus its origin spread threat prevention measures and possible cures structured by desiresof knowledge producers and commercial interests of media outlets representations in mass media are not only main sources of information for the general public but also feed into the structures of feelings and interests in different societies existing accounts tend to be split between idealisation and demonisation of chinas political system and responses to the pandemic they often adopt a binary homogenous view of the west andor china which remove complexities of the development of the pandemic on the ground and marginalise different voices we are particularly disheartened by the conflation of orientalism and sinophobia in many discussions which reinforces knowledge hierarchy and fuels racism and microaggression in everyday life these ramifications are illustrated through our personal encounters in the third section privileged to live in the relatively liberal and secluded environment of the academia we do not often encounter racial discrimination or microaggression that our lesser privileged fellow migrants experience however this global pandemic has awakened us to the reality that we had been avoiding the deep reflection that orientalism is alive and well in aiding the political production of knowledge and influencing the publics view on the orient and the oriental to borrow from edward said 1979 it is our hope that we as both migrant outsiders and academic insiders can shed light on this hardtoswallow realityagnotology is a term introduced by proctor 2008 2008 to refer to the growing field of studies of ignorance from a foucauldian perspective ignorance is part of the knowledge production process foucaults archaeological approach to knowledge sets out to uncover discursive struggles and excavate subjugated knowledges knowledges that are disqualified or dismissed by dominant standard and sanctioned discourses foucault 2003 agnotology pursues similar endeavours but places the accent more explicitly on the practices and politics that exclude delay supress deny erase or marginalise some forms or sources of knowledge proctor  schiebinger 2008there are many different typologies and overlapping notions of ignorance gross  mcgoey 2015 in this commentary we adopt proctors distinction of three forms of ignorance  as a native state as a selective choice and a strategic play proctor 2008 2008 the first refers to an innocent gap in knowledge it is an innocent form of ignorance in that it is impossible to know everything about a constantly changing world and that ignorance can motivate intellectual pursuits of research or education so over time these gaps can be filled in the second instance ignorance is the product of selective inattention this is not necessarily problematic however after all it is beyond our cognitive capacity to register all sensory information especially in the digital era we live in but politics and culture do play a role in making these selections  funding priorities divisions of scientific labour and competition between them and value systems that people submit to to name a few examples in the third instance politics and power become more decisive ignorance is a wilful act it is created sustained and reproduced a process that involves different lines of labour and various devices choices are made by some people with good or bad intentions to decide what should be kept from others for how long and in which way these choices raise questions as to the relations of power involved in the production of ignorance the sociospatial distribution of ignorance and the consequences these types of ignorance are not mutually exclusive but often entangled in practice a native state of ignorance may be caused and perpetuated by selective attention or strategic playsstudying ignorance requires a moment of reflection on our own ignorance given the fact that neither of us were trained or have worked in the fields of medicine virology epidemiology or public health in general and that knowledge about the virus and the pandemic is still rapidly emerging we will leave the daunting challenges of identifying epidemiological features and clinical treatments of the disease  overcoming the native state of ignorance  to colleagues at the frontline of this public health emergency our focus is on ignorance surrounding representations of chinas response and accumulated knowledge about the covid19 given our language skills we are inevitably ignorant of knowledge communicated in languages we do not know and will have to limit our attention to currently accessible materials as native mandarin chinese speakers we however have the advantage of accessing materials in chinese which allows us to observe the role played by language in silencing certain knowledgein response to the question from the financial times to compare authoritarian systems  namely china and russia to western democracies in handling the pandemic emmanuel macron did not give a straightforward answer but marked a strong distinction and strength of western democracies  free and transparent information which are considered to be in the dna of western democracies but lacking in china and russia mallet  khalaf 2020 he claimed that the immediacy of the information bears no comparison with ours social media are not free in those countries you dont have any social media  and there are obviously some things happening which we dont know about its up to china to tell them mallet  khalaf 2020 although he believed that cooperation and dialogues between countries of different political systems are necessary he warned that we should not allow ourselves as citizens of free democracies to be hypnotised by the way authoritarian regimes handle crises mallet  khalaf 2020the interview is representative of a dominant discourse about chinas response to the pandemic and a paradigm frame of china in general since the lockdown of wuhan authoritarianism has been invoked by journalists politicians and academics to explain the suffering of residents in china and to characterise the measures taken by chinese authorities to bring the pandemic under control as the epicentres started to shift to europe and the us and the chinese authorities reopened its economy chinas authoritarian regime on the one hand is blamed for delayed responses and resultant socioeconomic upheavals in many countries in the west on the other many people in western democracies are confronted with questions  which political system is better and is china the future when questions are framed around the binary of authoritarian versus democratic countries like these answering them  even in a balanced way  often conjures up discomfort and requires cautious calibration of vocabularywe engage with representations framed on authoritarian politics given its weight in representing china and imagining political life after the pandemic our main point is not that they are necessarily biased against china although some of them do contain factual errors or deliberate misrepresentation they raise some undoubtedly important questions about media censorship freedom of expression abusive state power and disempowerment of cdc in chinas political system however what worries us here is the danger of ready submission to and fixating attention on this conceptual category of authoritarianism in destructing if not completely distorting social realities unless we are ready to give in to conspiracy theories believing that the virus is manmade or genetically modified we must admit that there are objectively existing knowledge gaps about the sarscov2 virus since it is a new virus it takes time to overcome this form of ignorance  a native state proctor 2008 2008  and prepare mitigation strategies that are proportional to available knowledge perceived risks and available resources at a given moment this temporal dimension is also necessary when assessing the responses of different governments and the production of ignorance in retrospect otherwise instead of challenging ignorance we may risk reproducing ita relevant example here is jeffery wasserstrom professor in history at university of california irvine and author of several books on modern china whose critiques of chinas responses were published in the guardian to support his claim that local politicians in wuhan and hubei province acted in accordance with the incentive structure of chinas authoritarian state systems to conceal information wasserstrom 2020 suggested that they had known of the first case as early as 8 december 2019 he referred to an article from bbc published on 27 january 2020 feng 2020 the original article from bbc did not mention the source specifically it does match with the date of the first case stated in the press release from the wuhan municipal health commission published on 11 january 2020 wuhan municipal health commission 2020 what the bbc journalist failed to communicate clearly and which wasserstrom failed to triangulate is that this first case was backdated through retrospective epidemiological study wuhan municipal health commission 2020 it is also intriguing that his piece does not refer to the openaccess article published in the lancet on 24 janurary which would have thickened the plot he attempted to develop in that study researchers pinned the date when the first patient showed symptoms on 1 december 2019 huang et al 2020 but again it is crucial to bear in mind that this research was done retrospectively and that it takes time to make accurate diagnosis of infections with unknown causes during a flu season it is justified to doubt information from chinas official sources however this is more because it is secondary data rather than because it comes from china andor from its official organs it is problematic to let a priori concern over authoritarianism  featured by secrecy lack of transparency and corruption  prevent us from doing our job of verifying and triangulating datawhile wasserstrom may be unintentional researchers at the henry jackson society a ukbased foreign policy think tank deliberately omitted information when crossreferencing a source from outside mainland china their ignorance is deliberate and strategic proctor 2008 2008 it is produced to accumulate political capital to establish culpability and legal responsibilities of china they compiled a timeline to show that there was a deliberate coverup the evidence they relied on was a journalistic report on south china morning post which based on documents of the chinese government seen only by this journalist claimed that the first case was recorded on 17 november 2019 and there were 266 cases by the end of 2019 when the chinese state informed who ma 2020a 2020b although the journalist cautiously suggested that some cases may be identified retrospectively ma 2020a 2020b this was removed in the henry jackson societys report by silencing such noises  and only by doing so these researchers can confidently conclude with certainty that chinas medical authorities withheld authorisation to report the outbreak both internally and to the public henderson et al 2020 p14 a textbook example of authoritarian politics in response to similar misrepresentation by the sky news australia the journalist later clarified in her tweet posted on 13 april 2020 and emphasised that there was no indication when the chinese government was made aware of the case and chinese doctors only realised they were dealing with a new disease in midtolate december 2019ma 2020bthe lens of authoritarianism is also used to interpret the drastic measures taken by the chinese authorities and question their effectiveness bruce buckley china specialist reporting for the new york times took issue with the lockdown of wuhan in his article published on 5 february 2020 and maintained that this level of measure is a vast medical experiment conceivable only in authoritarian china buckley 2020 the phrase medical experiment conjures up the fear of a repressive authoritarian regime for emma grahamharrison a journalist for the guardian it was suspicious that two newly built hospitals were not running at full capacity one week after their completion grahamharrison 2020 in her article published on 19 february 2020 she referred to the lack of capacity of existing hospitals in wuhan not long ago citing an article from the wall street journal published on 5 february the parallel efforts of converting exhibition halls and a sports stadium to emergency hospitals and the absence of militarystyle emergency field hospitals an easier solution to the shortage of medical care facilities in her view instead of providing an answer through grounded research or consultation with medical communities she opted for an easy explanation of authoritarian politics she held that the complicated reality on the ground is a reminder of one of the main challenges for beijing as it struggles to contain the coronavirus its own secretive authoritarian system of government and its vast censorship and propaganda apparatus grahamharrison 2020 her conclusion appears to be influenced by her interviewee steve tsang professor of politics at soas china institute who believed that construction of these hospitals is more an attempt of the communist party to manage its imagemainstream media in the west are filled with similar accounts of chinas responses to the pandemic with china watchers and china specialists focusing on authoritarian politics this may have the worrying effect of drowning out the sobering voices from the expert communities on the frontline fighting this pandemic within china the decision to lockdown wuhan was not irrational but was based on the input from the scientific community about the virus and its threats while there was much uncertainty about the virus during the early weeks of the outbreak in wuhan by the time the chinese authorities decided to seal off the city it was clear to an epidemiologist li lanjuan who proposed quarantining wuhan to the elite politicians in beijing on the night of 22 january that the virus can transmit between humans even during the incubation period dong et al 2020 this was later confirmed by an article published by researchers from the university of hong kong in the lancet on 24 january 2020 which additionally reported cases of asymptomatic patients chan et al 2020 according to li lanjuan in the interview in view of the huge traffic around the chinese spring festival and the danger of this disease it was a drastic but necessary decision in order to prevent further spread of the virus nationwide dong et al 2020 when it comes to treatment hospital for chinese experts is also not an undifferentiated category not every hospital was capable of treating patients with a highly infectious disease and a triage system was needed to treat patients with symptoms with different severities and to avoid overwhelming a stressed healthcare system what emma grahamharrison called emergency hospitals were in fact quarantine centres for patients with mild symptoms and without underlying conditions to avoid cluster transmission within families or communities and to keep patients under close medical monitoring and provide rapid intervention in case their conditions worsen as explained by wang chen a pulmonologist and an expert in critical care medicine during an interview on 7 february 2020 the paper 2020 these two new hospitals were designed and equipped to mainly treat infected patients with more severe symptoms or underlying conditions researchers at nanfang zhoumo 2020 the decisions of chinese authorities are based on knowledge accumulated about the disease the threat to public health chinas own conditions and available resources at that timeiterations of chinas response through the lens of authoritarianism are as much about china as about the wests selfimagination they are symptomatic of and perhaps due to the conflation of sinophobia orientalism and statephobia since the eighteenth century sinophobia has become a dominant way for the west to conceive of china zhang 2008 generalisations about china  a threatening deviant despotic backward and inferior other  are invoked to constitute the west classifying a nation or a regime as authoritarian consolidates the wests power as a knowing subject to define others and affirms its moral authority and superiority characteristic here is the analysis from the economist 2020 drawing on a dataset on disasters compiled by researchers at catholic university of louvain in belgium it concluded that disasters killed more people in authoritarian countries than in democracies defined as countries with free and fair electionsthe economist 2020 even though chinas response may testify to the capacity of authoritarian governments in mobilising resources within a short period of time the lack of transparency and limited participation of civil society still renders it inferior to democratic countries when it comes to disaster interventions the economist 2020this distinction  authoritarianism versus democracy  also derives strength from the fear of the state or statephobia in foucaults word across political camps in the west the growth of surveillance and security state apparatus under neoliberalism has led to strong worries and resistance against the state hannah 2016 compounded by radical lefts construction of the state as the enemy of real democracy this has led to an often undifferentiated critique of the state and the expansion of its power hannah 2016 little wonder that agamben 2020 a warrior against excessive expansion of state power voiced strong protest against the emergency measures taken by the italian authorities according to him these measures were to legitimatise the normalcy of state of exception in the name of public health agamben 2020 as iek 2020 pointed out agambens reasoning suffers a crucial flaw  why would any state adopt measures that only harm both its own legitimacy and the interest of capital in his view agambens commentary is the extreme form of a widespread leftist stance of reading the exaggerated panic caused by the spread of the virus as a mixture of power exercise of social control and elements of outright racism blame nature or china iek 2020iek is right to worry that undifferentiated critique of active state interventions may temper political imaginations and prevent measures that are needed to bring the pandemic under control measures taken by the chinese government are perhaps the worst nightmares for liberals and leftists even though they were needed to slow the spread and prevent as many deaths as possible as revealed by stephen grey and andrew macaskill 2020 journalists reporting for reuters scientific advisors for boris johnson ruled out measures adopted by china very early on because such drastic actions would never be acceptable in a democracy like the uk giuseppe conte too in his interview with bbc defended his decision and believed that draconian measures like chinas are unacceptable in democratic countries lowen 2020against the backdrop of orientalism it is no surprise that the fatality rate of covid19  often used as an indicator of the performance of different governments  has been a subject of heated debate there are abundant accusations of the chinese state for underreporting the number of deaths in order to manage its image and keep itself in power qin  li 2020 there is little doubt that the real death toll is likely to be higher given the unpreparedness of the chinese authorities during the early days of the pandemic as we were finalising this commentary the chinese government raised the death toll by 50 per cent in wuhan on 17 april to include unreported presumed deaths of covid19 at home and miscategorised deaths in then overwhelmed hospitals this was quickly considered as evidence of deliberate coverup of an authoritarian state and an attempt to restore chinas image qin 2020 2020 despite that new yorks health department made a similar adjustment only three days later goodman  rashbaum 2020 this is yet another example of misplaced criticism about the trustworthiness of data based on political ideology there is no factual evidence from the accusers the west whereas the burden of proof falls upon the accused china moreover the proof from china is subject to the verification and approval of the accuserthe irony is that this scepticism about chinas data and distrust of an authoritarian state did not translate into effective measures in many democratic countries now with the benefit of hindsight to prepare for the threat of this disease to their healthcare systems in belgium for example until early march leading virologists and microbiologist still compared the covid19 to a more severe flu in communicating the risk to the public and informing policy decisions dierckx 2020 it took only a few days before medical professionals ran out of masks while the federal government was then caught up in the endless scandals of getting supplies of masks bervoet 2020 de nil 2020limiting attention to the chinese state actions also ignore other important forces and dynamics that contributed to chinas effective control of the pandemic see harvey 2020 macron is correct about censorship in china in mallet  khalaf 2020 but he like many in the west haunted by the image and anxiety of a digital surveillance state is overestimating the capacity of the chinese state in controlling flows of information to bypass censorship netizens in china have long used technology tools eg vpn and discursive tactics to share information online wu  alaimo 2018 as we have seen in the past months investigative journalism grassroots activists and social media have played an important role in alerting the public about the outbreak in wuhan and forcing the government to act with more accountability and care chen 2020 medical professionals across china rallied to support wuhan ordinary citizens both home and abroad quickly sent supplies and support to help families friends and healthcare workers in china most citizens in china also actively followed the advice form health authorities and medical professionals focusing on authoritarian politics either to praise or to despise does not do justice to the efforts made by citizens in china to defy the projected figures in mathematical modelsschiebinger 2008 describes in her study about selective ignorance in knowledge transfer between the peripheries and the colonial centre not all knowledge gained in african colonies about abortifacients was transferred back to the imperial centre because such knowledge was deemed irrelevant or against the political agenda for population growth and expansion in the colonies the frame of authoritarianism is one device that polices flows of knowledge across societies and cultures labouring ignorance such ignorance has been exploited by many elites in the west to deflect domestic pressure which disturbingly inflates antichina sentiments and racism within china nationalist sentiments  reinforced by perceived hostility from the west  have grown significantly this has been harnessed by the chinese state to shape narratives about its own management of the crisis and the political system at home and abroad spiral geopolitical tensions like these undermine not only global cooperation to control the pandemic but also collective efforts to bring about a more just equal and fair worldin addition to media knowledge about the disease is also shared through social interactions in everyday lives many overseas chinese like us have been following updates and advice shared by chinese authorities and friends in china sharing such knowledge often involve awkward moments here we refer mainly to public health lessons and not these heated talks about socalled wet market which does not even have a corresponding word in mandarin chinese or the consumption of bats in this section we will present xu fang one of the coauthors anecdotal experience in california to exemplify how distrusting and discrediting knowledge from china can take subtle forms in everyday encounters which intersects with race and genderon 24 march xus friend in coventry uk posted information about a webinar by dr zhang wenhong director of the department of infectious diseases in huashan hospital at fudan treatment and research centre the webinar was organised by the chineseamerican biopharmaceutical society located in the san francisco bay area dr zhang has emerged as a social media celebrity across china and likely among chinese people overseas as well for his expert knowledge bluntness in warning the public and calmness and frankness in describing the outbreak the free event was completely booked within three hours from her observation the peak number of simultaneous participants for the webinar reached close to 7500 during dr zhangs presentationthe 40minute presentation mostly covered the epidemics spread in shanghai multiple measures the shanghai municipal government took and dr zhangs teams experience diagnosing and treating covid19 patients in shanghai the covid19 ward they work in is the place all infected cases in shanghai have been treated it is a presentation with lots of statistics and medical jargon since dr zhang cited findings published in the lancet and works published by his team in peerreviewed medical journals such as jama or medrxiv the presentation and the qa afterwards provided valuable information not covered by western mainstream media at that time such as the rate of cluster infection the effectiveness of oxygen therapy and the unlikelihood of infection from being in the same enclosed public space with little interaction such as in an elevator with a covid19 patientxu uploaded the printscreened slides and audio recording of the webinar to a google folder and shared the link with two dozen friends and coworkers in and out of academia in the united states via text message or personal email immediately after the webinar with the introduction if you believe social distancing is the way to go consider a listen thanks to him and his team shanghai a city of 30 million so far has only 414 cases 329 recovered and four deaths as of today she was aware that friends in the west who did not have a wechat account or did not pay much attention to the outbreak statistics in china were unlikely to know who dr zhang is or why his experience and knowledge are valuable and thus would need some evidence to recognise this opportunity what happened afterwards inspired this section of the commentarythe responses from xus professional friends and acquaintances split along race regional origin and gender lines even when age and level of education are taken into consideration granted her observation is based on a rather selective and small sample since she did not find it necessary or unobtrusive to post the link to her facebook or linkedin accounts either of which reach a much bigger network of professional connections that decision or reservation to be more precise is due to the concern of encountering suspicions of her credentials and possible accusations of spreading misinformation despite the fact that she was confident about the credibility of the information that she shared with the abovementioned small group such selfcensorship or selective dissemination of knowledge indicated her existing awareness of how information from her a chinese national could be interpreted in a less than objective way and her decision to share the information with those whom she thought would welcome it however what she encountered from such a trusted small group was polite deflection or even overt dismissal and erasurewithin that group white females in general thanked xu for the important and valuable information while older white males in general pretended her message did not exist by subtly directing members of the fourteenmember group message to look at apparently more credible sources for example after a few grateful messages from older white female members of the group she received this one good morning name of the team team his name here useful source of coronavirus information go to google homepage below the search bar click on coronavirus information and resources covid19 that will take you to a page that has lots of information good luck indeed this member of the group provided a good source of information to others during a public health crisis and likely in his mind it was more civil to dismiss rather than overtly point out that a chinese source was less trustworthy his underlying message was plainly that the information she shared was not authentic or reliable while his recommendation of google was if he had reservations about dr zhangs presentation he could have pointed out which specific part he deemed problematic inquiries about sampling strategy study design or analytical models would have been welcome to foster an open environment for knowledge exchange which was exactly what happened when another colleague of hers of south asian descent questioned the validity of the information about the lack of community spread in china after reading the same message sent via email when she recommended the webinar to older white male friends who do not work in academia and sent them the link to the files again the response was silence in contrast to this response friends and coworkers originally from other developing countries who practice scholarship in the west especially females welcomed and appreciated the information for example im so glad that there are experts like prof zhang who are explaining the method to address the madness and confusion the slides looked really interesting from a colleague of south asian originxus experience is likely to resonate with many overseas chinese before authorities in western europe and the us and their science advisors decided to take more active and stringent measures of social distancing and lockdowns to contain the pandemic it had been a challenging and frustrating conversation to convince our colleagues and friends in our adopted home countries that the covid19 is not a flu everyone is vulnerable and avoiding nonessential social events is a must a gentle warning would often be perceived if not ridiculed as an overreaction convincing colleagues and friends to put on masks in crowded public places was probably the most difficult because medical experts from western europe and the us had repeatedly emphasised that masks were useless and wearing them was more a cultural thing in east asia for example the cdc in the united states did not recommend its usage until 3 april in its report citing recent studies published by highranking medical journals regarding virus transmission from asymptomatic patients the earliest publications of which are from chinese scholars in late february centers for disease control and prevention 2020although xus recent correspondents are a small group too small and haphazard for generalisation these experiences alerted us to consider orientalism present among fellow academics even when the evidence presented are credited by peerreviewed medical journals to understand the contrast it is useful to point out that dr zhang wenhong is a medical doctor trained and practising in china with good but accented english and xu is a relatively young and female academic not in the field of medicine furthermore the abovementioned incident took place when the reliability of statistics coming out of china was questioned literature on how the production of knowledge intersects with racism and sexism is abundant in the current case of covid19 when initial cases and knowledge of diagnosing and treating the disease were in china authority and power associated with the creation and possession of knowledge unavoidably intertwined with political ideology and orientalism extrapolating from the domination of imperialist great britain over egypt to the orientals a category broadly including chinese in the twentieth century said 1979 p32 points out how knowledge and knowledge production are closely associated with power and authority knowledge means rising above immediacy beyond self into the foreign and distant  to have such knowledge of such a thing is to dominate it to have authority over it in the current case we can see how knowledge possessed by the other and the authority obtained through such possession can be interpreted in two dimensions first knowledge about the virus and its spread and second the chinese experience or lessons learned from treating infected persons if the power of knowledge is demonstrated by abstracting it from local contexts and applying it to the foreign and distant then objections to and dismissal of that knowledge is the reassertion of power domination and western primacyto bridge said and proctor selective inattention as a form of ignorance production is exemplified by the silence or dismissal of dr zhangs presentation about his teams experience treating covid19 in shanghai such response from xus small group of correspondents demonstrates the clear intention to downplay the importance of the expert knowledge generated in the orient by an oriental and promoted by yet another oriental the other form of ignorance this commentary engages with strategic plays is simultaneously evident in the incident both forms of ignorance were expressed in implicit nonconfrontational ways given the nature of the associations between the correspondents and xu however the silence and dismissal explicitly communicated the purpose of their responses to her which was to discredit the power and authority embedded in the knowledge produced by dr zhang and the power and credentials embodied by her after all it was she who learned of the existence of the webinar recognised the significance of the knowledge it contained recorded it and vouched for its credibility when sharing it with the small groupfurthermore knowledge and power works in a dialectic way more power over the subject race requires more knowledge about them which thus facilitates the management and control of them all on the basis that the power in the west knows better about the subject race in the east better than they know themselves said 1979 2004 in the case of knowledge produced in the east recognition and authority have been granted in recent years for china and chinese scholars as well but the knowledge produced about covid19 and its reception demonstrates how illusory such recognition is this knowledge though produced to suggest global generalisability predominantly uses a territorially bound sample which is located in the east and concerns primarily a single ethnicity han chinese is now experiencing ignorance and dismissal in the west additional studies have been done and likely published based on data in other east asian countries with more democratic political systems such as south korea or japan but these are beyond the scope of this writing from the perspective of orientalism the oriental is irrational depraved fallen childlike different thus the european is rational virtuous mature normal said 1979 2004 p 40 what calls for more rationality maturity and coolheadedness in times of crisis than scientific research in this case how reliable could knowledge produced by the chinese about a virus be especially when authority figures in the united states  though heavily criticised for it  call it a chinese virus as said 1979 2004 p 46 points out it is impossible to untangle knowledge from power or to avoid the regrettable binary between the west and the east and the tendency of any knowledge based on such hardandfast distinction since this tendency is right at the centre of orientalist theory practice and values found in the west the sense of western power over the orient is taken for granted as having the status of scientific truth what scientific truth implies is its universality and rationality the pushback and ignorance we observed here was that knowledge produced by the oriental and disseminated by another oriental was fighting an uphill battle to be recognised as universal truth and credible scientific knowledge the strategic downplay and intentional inattention to produce ignorance can be understood as based on political ideology fearing the triumph of authoritarianism based on cultural prejudice and racist bigotry fearing a new round of yellow peril or based on sexism fearing the challenge to male authority which is exemplified by xus dismissed voice in promoting the webinarin promoting the webinar and the medical knowledge produced by dr zhang xu presented herself not only as a gatekeeper but also a credible source vouching for the authority of dr zhang however her credentials were not recognised by the white males in her small group which further resulted in the inattention paid to dr zhang in lakoffs 1973 work about how gender is associated with ways of speaking she examines how the social discrepancy in the positions of men and women in our society is reflected in linguistic disparities and deborah camerons 2007 work in dialogue with lakoff points out that since males are still associated with power and authority assertive tones are commonly associated with them instead of with females despite decades of feminist movements for gender equality in dialogue settings such as the anecdote xu encountered the domination of the male respondent was clearly communicated through dismissal of the medical research information she shared  most of which are published by peerreviewed medical journals in the west the gender element played a role in the incident was evidenced by the fact that in the responses that she has collected the majority of women regardless of race or profession responded with gratitude while males either ignored the shared information or scrutinised it closely though the latter is welcomed for the progress of scientific knowledge in this case her voice is ignored in in two senses due to being both chinese and female it appears these two visible characteristics are more salient than her scholarly credentials that allow her to recognise the authority and credibility of peerreviewed medical journalsour analysis and reflection have attempted to dissect the production and entanglement of different types of ignorance proctor 2008 2008 ignorance exists everywhere and can never be completely eradicated given how complex the world is and how little we know a native state of ignorance about the world will always exist and it takes both time and will to overcome it although not always necessary this process is shaped by practices and politics of ignoring raising questions as to relations of power and interest in the production of ignorance in the case of the ongoing pandemic there are knowledge gaps about the sarscov2 virus and scientists worldwide are racing to accumulate more knowledge about it so as to better inform public policies nationally or globally as we have sought to show ideological and political differences can frequently stay on the way of overcoming this native state of ignorance by saying this we are not implying that ignorance is always intentionally created with a bad faith conceptual frames that we subscribe to may sensitivise us to some aspects of sociopolitical lives while ignoring others although it may not be intentional it does remind us of the importance of reflexive exercise to question how our imaginations training and passions affect the politics we advocate for and write about in other instances as we have discussed ignorance is created andor maintained intentionally to serve political agendas this may negatively affect the process of accumulating and disseminating knowledge about the disease and measures to contain the pandemicin reviewing the discussions about chinas response we are intrigued by the emphasis on the china aspect in many accounts this is understandable given that the outbreak was first reported in china but if we are allowed to indulge in a thought experiment for a moment here had free and fair election  the commonly used definition of democracy  existed in china how would representations about chinas response look like would knowledge accumulated in china about the virus and precautionary measures still put under the same credibility test by democratic countries or will a more nuanced vocabulary also emerge to talk about china as well iek 2020 in raising these questions as we have attempted to bring out in this paper attention has been disproportionately placed on china  a threatening backward and untrustworthy other the legacy of orientalism and sinophobia reinforced by state phobia influences knowledge exchange from china it is one thing to claim that knowledge from china is to be taken with caution because more knowledge is needed given the novelty of this virus it is another to dismiss or discredit this knowledge altogether as we are revising this paper many european governments and us health authorities have reversed their earlier recommendations and finally called for maskwearing in public spaces it is a measure widely adopted in east asia since shortly after the outbreak began in wuhan in late january but ignored and even ridiculed in the west until recently this is yet another example of ignorance rooted in the struggles for and the fear of losing power and authority which unfortunately and unnecessarily complicates the global fight against covid19 as the saying goes a virus does not recognise national borders if the knowledge to fight it is itself subject to essentialism and exclusiveness this sets barriers that result in unnecessary loss and human suffering in saids 1994 p 31 words they give rise to polarizations that absolve and forgive ignorance and demagogy more than they enable knowledgeour discussion here also raises several interrelated conceptual questions for further research first the pandemic alerts us to the role of the state in coordinating resources and protecting public health it invites critical reflections upon the state its roles in socioeconomic management and statecentred political struggles in existing theories it has long been argued that the state is not a monolithic and coherent entity yet more attention is still paid to the repressive side of the state an undifferentiated attack on the state and statecentric struggles overlooks and will undermine its potential as an important scale and institution to create and defend conditions for individual and collective wellbeing hannah 2016 second it calls for reconceptualisation of authoritarianism and democracy in political studies to associate authoritarianism and democracy only with the national scale is a mistake of methodological nationalism denying their coexistence in any polity and at any scale it is perhaps also necessary to go back to the fundamental question of good government whereas authoritarianism and democracy are practices to achieve this end third comparing responses of different countries whether they are classified as democracies or authoritarian countries are pointless in an unevenly developed world hit by the pandemic asynchronously these attempts to abstract a chinese model a south korean model or a german model and to advocate their export or use as a benchmark are of little value given the differences in health care infrastructures and available resources as well as knowledge this is not a claim against drawing useful lessons from other countries experiences however if we must engage in comparative studies it is perhaps a more useful endeavour to investigate how preexisting inequalities in power wealth and knowledge have contributed to or been exacerbated by the spread of the pandemic over timeboth authors contributed equally to this article we thank the encouragement and detailed constructive comments from the reviewers the editors and the colleagues of the refcom research groupacquired immunity is established at the level of the individual either through natural infection with a pathogen or through immunization with a vaccine herd immunity box 1
 stems from the effects of individual immunity scaled to the level of the population it refers to the indirect protection from infection conferred to susceptible individuals when a sufficiently large proportion of immune individuals exist in a population this population-level effect is often considered in the context of vaccination programs which aim to establish herd immunity so that those who cannot be vaccinated including the very young and immunocompromised are still protected against disease depending on the prevalence of existing immunity to a pathogen in a population the introduction of an infected individual will lead to different outcomes figure 1
 in a completely naive population a pathogen will propagate through susceptible hosts in an unchecked manner following effective exposure of susceptible hosts to infected individuals however if a fraction of the population has immunity to that same pathogen the likelihood of an effective contact between infected and susceptible hosts is reduced since many hosts are immune and therefore cannot transmit the pathogen if the fraction of susceptible individuals in a population is too few then the pathogen cannot successfully spread and its prevalence will decline the point at which the proportion of susceptible individuals falls below the threshold needed for transmission is known as the herd immunity threshold anderson and may 1985 above this level of immunity herd immunity begins to take effect and susceptible individuals benefit from indirect protection from infection figure 1bbox 1glossary
herd immunity the indirect protection from infection conferred to susceptible individuals when a sufficiently large proportion of immune individuals exist in a population
herd immunity threshold the point at which the proportion of susceptible individuals in a population falls below the threshold needed for transmission
r
0 the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual introduced into a completely susceptible population
r
e the average number of secondary infections generated by a single infectious individual over an infectious period in a partially immune population
onward transmission the effective transmission of a pathogen from an infected individual to susceptible hosts
case fatality rate cfr proportion of deaths attributed to a certain disease among all individuals diagnosed with that disease
infection fatality rate cfr proportion of deaths attributed to a certain disease among all infected individualsunder the simplest model the herd immunity threshold depends on a single parameter known as r0 or the basic reproduction number figure 2
a r0 refers to the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual introduced into a completely susceptible population anderson and may 1985 if we consider a hypothetical pathogen with an r0 of 4 this means that on average one infected host will infect four others during the infectious period assuming no immunity exists in the population mathematically the herd immunity threshold is defined by 1  1r0 eg if r0  4 the corresponding herd immunity threshold is 075 anderson and may 1985 therefore the more communicable a pathogen the greater its associated r0 and the greater the proportion of the population that must be immune to block sustained transmission figure 2b a similar parameter important for understanding population-level immunity is the effective reproduction number re or rt re is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a single index case over an infectious period in a partially immune population delamater et al 2019 unlike r0 re does not assume a completely susceptible population and consequently will vary depending on a populations current immune state which will change dynamically as an outbreak event or vaccination campaign unfolds ultimately the goal of vaccination programs is to bring the value of re below 1 this occurs when the proportion of the population with immunity exceeds the herd immunity threshold at this point pathogen spread cannot be maintained so there is a decline in the number of infected individuals within the populationthe above interpretation of r0 and its relation to the herd immunity threshold is the simplest understanding of these terms it relies on several key assumptions including homogeneous mixing of individuals within a population and that all individuals develop sterilizing immunityimmunity that confers lifelong protection against reinfectionupon vaccination or natural infection in real-world situations these epidemiological and immunological assumptions are often not met and the magnitude of indirect protection attributed to herd immunity will depend on variations in these assumptionsr0 is defined by both the pathogen and the particular population in which it circulates thus a single pathogen will have multiple r0 values depending on the characteristics and transmission dynamics of the population experiencing the outbreak delamater et al 2019 this inherently implies that the herd immunity threshold will vary between populations which is a well-documented occurrence delamater et al 2019 for any infectious disease communicability depends on many factors that impact transmission dynamics including population density population structure and differences in contact rates across demographic groups among others anderson and may 1985 all of these factors will directly or indirectly impact r0 and consequently the herd immunity thresholdto establish herd immunity the immunity generated by vaccination or natural infection must prevent onward transmission not just clinical disease for certain pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 clinical manifestations are a poor indicator of transmissibility as asymptomatic hosts can be highly infectious and contribute to the spread of an epidemic once the herd immunity threshold is reached the efficacy of herd immunity largely depends on the strength and duration of the immunity acquired for pathogens in which lifelong immunity is induced as is the case for measles vaccination or infection herd immunity is highly effective and can prevent pathogen spread within a population however this situation is relatively rare as immunity for many other infectious diseases such as pertussis and rotavirus wanes over time as a consequence herd immunity is less effective and periodic outbreaks can still occur finally if immunity is unevenly distributed within a population clusters of susceptible hosts that frequently contact one another may remain even if the proportion of immunized individuals in the population as a whole surpasses the herd immunity threshold these pockets of susceptible individuals are still at risk for local outbreaksthe ongoing sars-cov-2 pandemic has caused over 35 million clinically confirmed cases of covid-19 and has claimed more than 250000 lives worldwide as of may 4 2020 numerous clinical trials to evaluate novel vaccine candidates and drug repurposing strategies for the prevention and treatment of sars-cov-2 infection are currently ongoing however it is unknown whether these trials will produce effective interventions and it is unclear how long these studies will take to establish efficacy and safety although an optimistic estimate for any vaccine trial is at least 1218 months in the absence of a vaccine building up sars-cov-2 herd immunity through natural infection is theoretically possible however there is no straightforward ethical path to reach this goal as the societal consequences of achieving it are devastatingsince the onset of sars-cov-2 spread various studies have estimated the basic reproductive number r0 of the virus to be in the range of 2 to 6 from an initial cohort of 425 confirmed cases in wuhan china an r0 of approximately 22 was estimated meaning that on average each infected individual gives rise to 22 other infections li et al 2020 more recent estimates place the r0 higher at 57 although many estimates fall within this range sanche et al 2020 this variation reflects the difficulty of obtaining accurate r0 estimates in an ongoing pandemic and the current estimated sars-cov-2 r0 values likely do not indicate a complete picture of the transmission dynamics across all countriesassuming an r0 estimate of 3 for sars-cov-2 the herd immunity threshold is approximately 67 this means that the incidence of infection will start to decline once the proportion of individuals with acquired immunity to sars-cov-2 in the population exceeds 067 as discussed above this model relies on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneous population mixing and uniform sterilizing immunity in recovered individuals across demographic groups which are unlikely to hold true nevertheless this basic model can give us a rough idea of the number of individuals that would need to be infected to achieve herd immunity in the absence of a vaccine given an approximate herd immunity threshold and a countrys populationone important measure to evaluate the impact of sars-cov-2 spread is the overall case fatality rate cfr the cfr is the proportion of deaths attributed to a certain disease among all individuals diagnosed with that disease ie cases over a specified period of time it is worth noting that there is still significant uncertainty in the cfr for covid-19 due to variation in the testing capacity per country selection bias for which individuals receive testing and differences in how deaths are officially attributed to covid-19 further cfr is also sensitive to variation in the underlying age structure and distribution of comorbidities among populations consequently cfrs may differ considerably over time and between countries in the case of covid-19 the initial estimate of the cfr in a small cohort of 41 individuals with laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection was high 15 huang et al 2020 however this number has markedly decreased as more data have become available using data from all laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland china verity et al obtained an estimated overall cfr of 138 adjusted for censoring under-ascertainment and the underlying demography in china and similar estimates have been obtained from other groups verity et al 2020 wu et al 2020a like many other infectious diseases a non-uniform covid-19 cfr has been reported across age groups with the vast majority of deaths occurring among individuals 60 years old or greaterthe most relevant measure to evaluate the societal cost of achieving global sars-cov-2 herd immunity is the overall infection fatality rate ifr the ifr is defined as the proportion of deaths caused by a certain disease among all infected individuals because some cases will not be reported especially among asymptomatic hosts or individuals with mild symptoms the ifr will inherently be lower than the cfr if we combine infection fatality data with an estimate of the number of individuals that need to develop immunity to reach the herd immunity threshold we can project the expected number of deaths as a consequence of meeting this threshold because of the uncertainty in the covid-19 ifr we use three different point estimates in our analysis 1 an ifr of 02 2 an ifr of 06 that is in line with the ifr determined by verity et al and 3 an ifr of 1 figure 2c assuming a uniform herd immunity threshold of 67 r0  3 and an ifr of 06 the absolute number of expected deaths across the globe would exceed 30 million people figure 2c notably this analysis assumes that ifrs do not vary across countries and it does not consider factors that lead to heterogeneity in ifrs including differences in access to healthcare resources and variation in the prevalence of comorbiditiesin reality cfrs and ifrs vary dramatically across countries as highlighted by the current estimates of unadjusted cfrs across the globe italy 137 united states 577 south korea 233 the centre for evidence-based medicine 2020 although testing biases and differences in age demographics across countries account in part for these elevated regional cfrs additional factors likely play a role most notably a strain on local healthcare systems in italy a sudden influx of covid-19 patients in march led to a shortage of intensive care unit beds and other essential medical resources causing a substantial burden on hospitals this outbreak underscores the importance of taking into account the limits of local healthcare infrastructure and how exceeding these limits can exacerbate negative outcomes of covid-19particularly in the context of attaining herd immunity to sars-cov-2 a regard for finite healthcare resources cannot be overstated as this policy inherently relies on allowing a large fraction of the population to become infected unchecked the spread of sars-cov-2 will rapidly overwhelm healthcare systems a depletion in healthcare resources will lead not only to elevated covid-19 mortality but also to increased all-cause mortality this effect will be especially devastating for countries in which hospitals have limited surge capacity where minimal public health infrastructure exists and among vulnerable communities including prison and homeless populationsbecause sars-cov-2 is a novel pathogen many features of its transmission and infection dynamics are not well characterized thus our above analysis provides only a sense of the potential ramifications given a scenario in which we attain herd immunity via natural infection we do not consider numerous complexities of viral spread and infectivity including variation in r0 across time and populations heterogeneity in the attack and contact rates across demographic groups and inter-individual variation in communicability and disease severity although these aspects are essential to understand the full picture of sars-cov-2 community spread while these epidemiological factors have important implications in the context of herd immunity currently they are difficult to estimate given the limited data availabledifferences in population density cultural behaviors population age structure underlying comorbidity rates and contact rates across groups influence transmission dynamics within communities so the assumption of a uniform r0 across populations is not realistic further variation in transmissibility between individuals may play a major role in sars-cov-2 spread superspreading events occur when circumstances favorable for high rates of transmission arise these events involve a single index case infecting a large number of secondary contacts and are known to be important in driving outbreaks of infectious diseases including sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and measles lloyd-smith et al 2005 reports of sars-cov-2 superspreading events have been documented suggesting that heterogeneity in infectivity may significantly impact the dynamics of its transmission liu et al 2020 finally the factors that influence inter-individual heterogeneity in covid-19 susceptibility clinical pathology and disease outcome are not well understood reported differences in sex- and ethnicity-specific cfrs suggest that genetic environmental and social determinants likely underlie variation in susceptibility to covid-19 and the severity of covid-19 complications although future studies are needed to explore this further nasiri et al 2020the ability to establish herd immunity against sars-cov-2 hinges on the assumption that infection with the virus generates sufficient protective immunity at present the extent to which humans are able to generate sterilizing immunity to sars-cov-2 is unclear a recent study assessing the possibility of sars-cov-2 reinfection in a small cohort of rhesus macaques found that reinfection was not able to occur 1 month after the first viral challenge suggesting at least short-term sterilizing immunity in these animals bao et al 2020 in a cohort of 175 recovered covid-19 patients sars-cov-2-specific serum neutralizing antibodies nabs were detected at considerable albeit variable titers in most n  165 individuals wu et al 2020b indicating that the production of nab against sars-cov-2 is relatively commonwhereas these findings are promising other important questions to consider are whether nab titers will wane over time and how long acquired immunity will last previous studies in confirmed sars patients have demonstrated that nab responses against sars-cov persisted for several months to 2 years although all individuals displayed low titers after about 15 months mo et al 2006 further elevated concentrations of specific antibodies to coronavirus 229e one of the viruses responsible for the common cold were found 1 year after infection although these titers were not sufficient to prevent reinfection in all individuals callow et al 1990 together these studies suggest that protection against reinfection with coronavirus species tends to diminish given sufficient time although longitudinal serological studies are needed to assess the duration of sars-cov-2 immunity if this proves to also be true for sars-cov-2 persistent herd immunity may never be attained in the absence of recurrent vaccination indeed modeling of the transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 predicts that short-term immunity 10 months would give rise to annual outbreaks while longer-term immunity 2 years would lead to biennial outbreaks kissler et al 2020 mass serological testing is now needed to determine how many individuals have been infected how many individuals are immune and how far we are from reaching the herd immunity threshold that said even if reinfection can occur after sterilizing immunity wanes enduring memory cells of the adaptive immune system would likely facilitate immune control of the virus and limit disease pathology which would hopefully decrease the clinical severity of subsequent infectionsin a sufficiently immune population herd immunity provides indirect protection to susceptible individuals by minimizing the probability of an effective contact between a susceptible individual and an infected host in its simplest form herd immunity will begin to take effect when a population reaches the herd immunity threshold namely when the proportion of individuals who are immune to the pathogen crosses 1  1r0 at this point sustained transmission cannot occur so the outbreak will decline however in real-world populations the situation is often much more complex epidemiological and immunological factors such as population structure variation in transmission dynamics between populations and waning immunity will lead to variation in the extent of indirect protection conferred by herd immunity consequently these aspects must be taken into account when discussing the establishment of herd immunity within populations there are two possible approaches to build widespread sars-cov-2 immunity 1 a mass vaccination campaign which requires the development of an effective and safe vaccine or 2 natural immunization of global populations with the virus over time however the consequences of the latter are serious and far-reachinga large fraction of the human population would need to become infected with the virus and millions would succumb to it thus in the absence of a vaccination program establishing herd immunity should not be the ultimate goal instead an emphasis should be placed on policies that protect the most vulnerable groups in the hopes that herd immunity will eventually be achieved as a byproduct of such measures although not the primary objective itselfat present humanity is threatened by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 pandemic the risk of severe infection with the virus depends heavily on physical factors of the infected persons and the quality of the medical system according to a recent study the estimated infection fatality ratio ifr averaged over all age-groups including those who dont have symptoms is between 02 and 16 with an average of 066 verity et al 2020 these numbers look small and the fatality risk may seem acceptable and therefore the danger is often marginalized this is surprising considering that the apollo crew the space shuttle astronauts and the allied soldiers during the 2003 iraq war took a deadly risk of this magnitude only very few people take such risks voluntarily and with full consciousness for comparison the lethal risk of a fatal accident with a commercial aircraft was 17700000 in 2008 and even such a small risk is not taken by some people considering that the ifr of the seasonal flu is about 00401 centers for disease 2010 or even much lower wong et al 2013 the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 appears to be significantly higher than for influenza flu although the numbers for sars-cov-2 are quite preliminary and the estimates may drop over time verity et al 2020 faust et al 2020 it is quite clear that the strategy of herd immunization of the population is not an option as the number of victims would be far too high great hopes for coping with the pandemic currently rest on the development of a vaccine unfortunately it is completely uncertain when an effective and well-tolerated vaccine will be generally available to contain the pandemic drugs such as chloroquine remdesivir lopinavir and ritonavir are also considered to be great sources of hope in the fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 grein at al 2020 however even if one of the drugs should prove to be effective there is no guarantee that the drug can be made available to the world population in sufficient quantities in addition it is possible that despite the use of drugs going through a severe course of disease can lead to lifelong neuropsychiatric sequelae troyer et al 2020 zandifar  badrfam 2020 or cause other diseases ackermann et al 2020 varga et al 2020containing the pandemic is therefore the only viable way to quench the spread of the virus but containing the pandemic is a difficult task as about 44 of sars-cov-2 infections are caused by people with a presymptomatic and asymptomatic course of infection he et al 2020 therefore due to the absence of symptoms many people do not know that they are infected and are spreading the virus and these people make it very difficult to trace the transmission chains furthermore about 10 of infected people are responsible for 80 of infections kupferschmidt 2020 lloyd-smith et al 2005 people who have many social contacts at work or in their private lives and who do not protect themselves and others sufficiently by observing the rules of distance and hygiene or who consider the risk of the virus to be low appear to be a serious problem in the actual pandemic for these reasons the government must act at various levels to avert great harm to the population the effectiveness of the containment strategy depends on1how societies are able to protect themselves personally against infection through hygiene social distance and technical aids such as protective masks glasses gloves2how well the infrastructure is in place to identify the infection chains and effectively contain the spread eg through mobile data collection isolation or a lockdown3how well the seriously ill can be treated in hospitals
in view of these prospects it seems necessary for the time being to prevent the spread of the virus and to treat those infected as well as possible in order to ensure the latter the capacities of the health system must not be overloaded but it is clear that this condition means that the pandemic will last for years without a vaccine to not overload the medical system governments are pursuing the concept of containment by means of a lockdown because it proved successful in st louis during the spanish flu of 1918 this approach is quite effective when the population obeys the rules but the impact on the state economy and society is devastating when the lockdown lasts longer than a few weeks therefore this concept is not a viable way to contain the pandemic in the long term consequently it is necessary to fight the infection where it occursunderstanding the transmission pathways is the key to finding effective measures to block the infection and to reliably protect healthcare workers and the population contact infection were initially assumed to be the main transmission route of sars-cov-2 today hygiene measures and the avoidance of shaking hands effectively prevent this path of infection droplet infection is currently assumed to be the main transmission route over short distances wang et al 2020 since this path of infection is via the air the rules of distance are effective soper 1919 and wells et al 1936 but it is also known that sars-cov-2 can remain infectious in aerosols for more than 3 h at least under laboratory conditions at high humidity van doremalen et al 2020 and pyankov et al 2018 it is therefore conceivable that infections can also occur under special conditions over long distances provided that the local virus concentration reaches the minimum infection dose due to poor air exchange in roomsa significant proportion of the aerosol exhaled by humans has a diameter of less than 10 m johnson et al 2011 when breathing speaking singing and coughing it is also known that the size and number of droplets increases with the volume of the voice asadi et al 2019 loudon  roberts 1968 and it is known that upper respiratory tract diseases increase the production of aerosol particles lee et al 2019 water droplets of this size evaporate within a few seconds at normal humidity liu et al 2019 and rensink 2004 droplets with a diameter of 10 m for instance are evaporated after about 1 s at 50 relative humidity and larger droplets sink quickly to the ground and evaporate marin et al 2016 2019 rossi et al 2019 if the viruses are released as naked viruses together with the salt after the droplets have evaporated the spatial concentration decreases rapidly over time as the viruses no longer move in a correlated manner but quickly separate due to the chaotic turbulent flow motion the viral load thus decreases rapidly in time and space making infections over long distances or long periods of time increasingly unlikely for this reason it is most important to understand the transmission of the virus over short distanceshygiene regulations and social distancing are very effective in blocking short distance infections during the lockdown the distance rules can usually be adhered to but what happens when the actual lockdown is over and the people meet again in a confined space then additional effective and efficient protection is essential to stabilise infection rates since the viruses are spread by contact and droplet infection technical devices are required that effectively intervene in the chain of infection and effectively block infection an effective protection is the respiratory mask as known since 100 years soper 1919 the sars outbreak in hong kong suggested that the use of simple face masks may have contributed to an overall reduction in the incidence of viral respiratory infections leung et al 2003 lo et al 2005 another study has shown that even a simple surgical mask can effectively reduce sars infection seto et al 2003 these results are supported by recent articles chu et al 2020 howard et al 2020 leung et al 2020b zhang et al 2020it was surprizing that for months who the cdc and many public health professionals in europe advised against wearing face masks unless someone has covid-19 or cares for someone who has covid-19 feng et al 2020 leung et al 2020a this recommendation was based on three allegations first it was said that there is no scientific evidence that face masks can protect against dropletaerosol infections second it was argued that the population will not be able to wear the masks properly third the statement that people will feel safe when wearing masks and then become careless and take risks was frequently made at the same time these experts have stressed that health professionals urgently need face masks to protect themselves effectively this contradiction has created uncertainty among the population and called into question the credibility of the experts it is a fact that particle filtration masks are recognized as legal occupational safety equipment and that the wearing of these masks in contaminated areas is required by labor law there is therefore no doubt that these masks when used correctly provide effective protection within the specification range the effectiveness of simple mouth-and-nose covers and surgical masks is less well accepted the international council of nurses icn estimates that on average 7 of all confirmed cases of covid-19 are among healthcare workers icn 2020 this illustrates that surgical masks may not provide the reliable protection against droplet infection as anticipated it is therefore very important to distinguish clearly between the different mask types when talking about their protective function unfortunately this was not done sufficiently by the virologists and politically responsible persons in the initial phase of the pandemic also the second argument is questionable why should the people of western societies not be able to protect themselves as many people in east asian countries have long been doing many people in east asian countries have already recognized through numerous pandemics that proper masks work effectively it does not seem right to regard the western population as unteachable or even incapable the third argument is also false because the opposite is true according to scientific studies kimberly et al 2020 scott et al 2007 and ruedl et al 2012 if people protect themselves personally they have dealt with the danger and therefore they benefit from the protection of the safety device and from the less risky behaviour due to insight the reason why these facts were not appreciated by the experts is due to the attempt to prevent competition for protective masks between medical personnel and the publicin the meantime the general perception of the protective effect of face masks has become generally accepted in the usa the cdc has changed its guidelines and recommended that the public wear fabric face masks in other countries too it is now recommended to protect themselves with suitable masks however it is recommended by governments and professionals to wear only simple mouse-and-nose covers that can be manufactured by the people themselves or surgical masks to avoid distribution battles with medical staff for certified and comfortable particle filtration masks but the big question is how effectively these homemade mouth-and-nose covers and surgical masks can protect against droplet infection the answer is highly relevant to guide public behaviour leung et al 2020 one study suggests that a surgical face mask and masks made of dense cotton fabrics apparently cannot effectively prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 into the environment through the coughing of patients with covid-19 bae et al 2020 another study suggests that any mask no matter how efficiently it filters or how well it is sealed has minimal effect unless used in conjunction with other preventive measures such as isolation of infected cases immunization good respiratory etiquette and regular hand hygiene kwok et al 2015 these findings contradict the results in leung et al 2003 lo et al 2005 seto et al 2003 due to the contradiction it is understandable that experts in the media have expressed the opinion that there is no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of masks and therefore the wearing of masks in public was not recommended for a long time the fallacy of politicians and virologists however was to generalize the results obtained with simple mouth-and-nose covers to all masks without differentiationin order to clarify whether or to what extent these masks offer effective protection against droplet infection and to understand why research results differ on this simple scientific question we have carried out these tests first we analyse the flow blockage caused by surgical masks when coughing as this is essential for the protection of others and because coughing is a typical symptom of covid-19 second we qualify the effectiveness of different filter materials and masks to determine the protection ability against droplets finally we prove the effect of gap flows at the edge of surgical and particle filtrating respiratory masks in contrast to the medical studies cited we apply engineering research methods of fluid mechanics the use of this research approach has several reasons firstly the detachment of droplets in the lungs and throat and their convective transport through the mouth into the atmosphere until inhalation as well as the deposit and evaporation of droplets is a purely fluid mechanical process secondly the effective blocking of the flow with suitable masks is a research subject of fluid mechanics thirdly the filtering of particles from an air stream with the aid of suitable materials is also a purely fluid mechanical problem as well as the gap flow finally this approach also has the advantage that the results are reproducible in a statistical sense since the boundary conditions are well defined we are not studying whether an infection really occurs in a special case but whether an infection is physically possible in generalin the first sets of the experiments outlined in section 31 the flow field generated by coughing without and with a surgical mask is examined as coughing sets the air strongly in motion and because coughing is a typical symptom of covid-19 to measure the flow field quantitatively in space and time we use particle image velocimetry piv raffel et al 2018 for the measurements a 8 m long testing room with a cross section of 2 m  2 m was seeded with dehs di-ethyl-hexyl-sebacat tracer particles with a mean diameter of 1 m khler et al 2002 dehs was used as these droplets do not evaporate as quickly as water droplets the tracer particles provided by a seeding generator pivtec gmbh germany were illuminated in a light-sheet generated with a frequency doubled ndyag laser spitlight piv 100015 innolas laser gmbh germany the light-sheet was oriented normal to the mouth opening and parallel to the symmetry axis of the body and the longitudinal axis of the room the light scattered by the tracer particles were recorded with back illuminated scientific cmos cameras pcoedge 55 pco ag germany equipped with zeiss distagon t lens with a focal length of 35 mm and 50 mm the triggering of the system components was achieved with a programmable timing unit lavision gmbh germany the recorded series of images were evaluated with a commercial computer program davis lavision gmbh germany these quantitative piv measurements allow to determine the area that can be contaminated due to the exhaled air the velocity of the exhaled droplets and the turbulence properties of the flowin the second set of experiments discussed in section 32 common household materials currently used by the population and some medical staff to make simple masks at home were tested but also a surgical mask and a ffp3 mask to visualize their filtering properties the tested materials are given in table 1
 for the investigation a test set-up was installed which largely fulfilled the officially prescribed test conditions in europe din en 149 2009 the materials were installed one after the other in a fixed position in front of the inlet of a rectangular flow channel with a cross-section of 01 m  01 m as shown in fig 1
 the material was held in place with a special clamping device that seals tightly to the duct to avoid leakage flows to explore the filtering performance of the different materials the movement of small aerosol droplets passing through the media was observed visually in front of and behind the filter material with a digital camera we only use droplets whose diameter is less than 2 m since the removal of the smallest droplets in an air stream is the greatest challenge in mask development if these droplets can be effectively filtered out effectively then all droplets larger than 2 m can also be filtered the droplets were generated from dehs with an aerosol generator agf 20 palas gmbh dehs was used again as these droplets are long lasting consequently bias errors due to evaporation effects can be neglected a ndyag double-pulse laser evergreen 200 quantel france was used to illuminate the droplets the output beam was fanned out with a few lenses to form a 1 mm thin light-sheet the light-sheet was located in the middle of the flow channel parallel to the flow direction as indicated in fig 1the scattered light emitted by the illuminated aerosol in the light-sheet plane was recorded with a highly sensitive pco edge 55 scmos camera equipped with a zeiss distagon t lens with a focal length of 50 mm the triggering of the system components and the data recording was realized again with the software davis from lavision the flow velocity was driven by the pressure difference between the atmosphere and the flow box the flow rate through the filter material was adjusted approximately according to the din en 149 2009 test standard 90 lmin the volume flow rate and the movement of the droplets through the filter material was measured optically with high spatial and temporal resolution using piv to calculate the volume flow rate the average flow velocity within the light-sheet plane in the flow channel was measured and it was assumed that this velocity is homogeneous over the cross section of the channel this assumption is justified as the filtering materials are homogeneous and the inflow condition is constant across the filtering material with the know size of the cross section the volume flow rate can be calculated the pressure drops provided in table 1 are calculated from the measured pressure drops and the volume flow rate it is assumed that the pressure loss is proportional to the square of the volume flow rate the pressure drop across the filter material was measured with a testo 480 testo se  co kg germany pressure transducer with an uncertainty of about 3 pafor the third set of experiments analysed in section 33 simple flow visualizations using smoke were performed in order to demonstrate the effect of the gap around the mask edge a person exhaled air seeded with tracer particles while wearing surgical and ffp2 masksin the first series of experiments one person performed a single severe cough while the piv system was measuring the flow field data the video in the supplementary material shows the temporal evolution of the process the results displayed in this subsection show instantaneous velocity fields of various independent time-resolved flow field measurements color-coded is the magnitude of the local flow velocity and the vectors indicate the direction of the flow movement at a given time step in areas where the flow movement remains close to zero over the whole recording time blue color no droplets can penetrate as only the flow can move the particles to other areas large droplets with a diameter of 1 mm or more such as those produced when sneezing lok 2016 can fly ballistic over long distances and occasionally ballistic flying droplets are produced when certain sounds are spoken but sneezing is not a typical covid-10 symptom so that this will not we considered here the small droplets that are normally produced when breathing speaking singing and coughing are immediately slowed down and then move with the flow velocity of the ambient air it is therefore important to study the air set in motion by exhalation furthermore the small droplets are particularly dangerous because they can be inhaled deep into the lungs
fig 2
a shows that the spread of the exhaled air forms a cone like shape similar to a free turbulent jet see video the flow velocity is reaching values up to 1 ms near the mouth but due to the widening of the cone caused by the turbulent mixing and entrainment reuther  khler 2020 the flow velocity decreases in streamwise direction the widening of the area in motion reduces the viral load significantly with distance a single strong cough sets the air in motion over a distance of less than 15 m in the experiments distances of more than 15 m can be considered safe according to these results since no droplets can reach such large distances when accelerated by a single cough however if the cough lasts longer greater distances can be achieved as shown in fig 2b for this reason it is important to dynamically increase the distance to a person if the coughing stimulus is about to last longerthe results in fig 2c illustrate how the spread of the airflow from the mouth during coughing is very effectively inhibited by a surgical mask physically the mask ensures that the directional jet like air movement with high exit velocity from the mouth is converted into an undirected air movement with low velocity behind the mask this is because the exhaled air increases the pressure inside the mask compared to the atmosphere outside and the pressure difference creates a flow movement in all directions this effect is of utmost importance for limiting the virus load in the environment the results show that even a simple mouth-and-nose cover or a surgical mask can effectively protect other people in the vicinity because the mask prevents the droplets from spreading over a wide area a simple mask with sufficient flow resistance therefore provides very effective protection for people in the surrounding area when infected and wearing the mask wearing a mask is therefore absolutely useful to protect others according to our quantitative measurements
fig 2d shows the spread of exhaled air when speaking it can be clearly seen that a greater spread of the exhaled air appears than when coughing with a mask consequently wearing a mask during normal face-to-face conversations and of course also when talking on the smartphone in a human environment is extremely useful to stop the transmission of the sars-cov-2 infection via droplets it must also be taken into account that persons with a presymptomatic or asymptomatic course of infection will infect other persons most likely during face-to-face conversations a mask will therefore make an effective contribution to suppressing this significant path of infectionin this section we want to find out if the material of simple mouth-and-nose covers surgical masks and ffp3 masks can protect the user from droplet infection if the surrounding air is contaminated with sars-cov-2 in this case the mask material must have good filtering properties to stop small droplets that typically occur when speaking singing and coughing since large droplets are easily filtered out by simple materials we focus on small droplets in the range between 03 and 2 m because they are produced in large fractions when speaking singing and coughing and they can penetrate deep into the lungs the droplets were distributed approx 400 mm in front of the filter materials in order to make the motion of the droplets and the filtering ability of the materials clearly visible an inhomogeneous droplet distribution was generated the flow direction is from left to right and the flow state of the incoming air is laminar if the intensity of the scattered light emanating from the droplets is large in front of the filter material left image and close to zero behind the filter material right image the droplets are almost completely filtered out through the material if on the other hand no significant reduction in intensity can be detected behind the filter material the filter effect is negligible the area of the filter mount and the channel edges are not shown in the following images since no relevant flow and droplet information is visible in these areas the results presented are qualitative but intended to be this way to provide readers with visual evidence of the particle penetration through different candidate filter media a better impression of the filter efficiency is obtained by viewing the second video in the supplementary materialthe comparison of the two pictures in fig 3
left shows that almost all droplets pass the tested surgical face mask unhindered consequently this mask does not provide serious self protection against droplet infection only a mixing of the droplet distribution takes place due to the porosity of the filter material it is fatal that medical personnel are often so poorly protected by these masks but it is also fatal for patients if clinical staff with a presymptomatic or asymptomatic course of infection uses these maskseven worse than the surgical face masks is the hygiene mask see fig 3 right this mask is designed for catching larger objects such as hair and spook but tiny droplets such as those produced when talking singing and coughing cannot be filtered out of the air stream by the hygiene mask it should also be noted that the flow resistance of the hygiene mask is so low that even the protective mechanism described in subsection 31 does not function effectively fig 4
reveals the effectiveness of particle filtering with toilet paper with 4 layers paper towel coffee filters and microfibre cloth which also offer no serious protection against droplets in this size range only very large droplets are retained by these materials and therefore these materials are suitable for their intended use but not as filter material for small droplets it is therefore strongly discouraged to make masks from these materials with the aim of protecting oneself from infectionfurthermore a very strong fleece was tested which serves as a protective coating on ironing boards the material is 4 mm thick completely opaque and has a pressure drop of about 35 pa however a filter effect is not visible as indicated in fig 5
left the droplet clouds flow almost unfiltered through the fleece even several layers of a dense fabric do not have a proper filtering effect on the considered droplet sizes which escape mainly when breathing speaking singing and coughinggood results could only be achieved with the material of a vacuum cleaner bag with fine dust filter properties see fig 5 right despite the small droplets used in these tests almost all droplets are reliably filtered out consequently also no larger droplets will be able to pass through the material according to the manufacturer swirl the material filters 999 of fine dust down to 03 m diameter this vacuum cleaner bag with fine dust filter therefore has better filtering properties than all tested materials and masks and even an ffp2 protective mask has poorer filtering properties as it only has to filter out 94 of the fine dust down to 06 m to meet the specifications uvex 2020 the material of vacuum cleaner bags with fine dust protection is therefore very well suited as a self-protecting mask if only the filter effect is considered however because vacuum cleaner bags are not certified clinical products they may contain unhealthy ingredients that kill bacteria and harmful fibers that may leak from the bag material it is therefore uncertain whether this material is suitable in practice as a material for a respirator mask
fig 6
left illustrates the filtering capabilities of an ffp3 mask under the test conditions nearly all droplets are filtered out as expected therefore this mask type is very well suited to protect people from an infection by means of aerosols even when the environment is strongly contaminated with infectious droplets recently some hospitals in the usa make use of halyard h600 material to protect their employers from aerosol infection the test result of the material is displayed in fig 6 right it is clearly visible that the filtering capacity of the material is not sufficient to protect people from infection by aerosols if the environment is contaminated with the sars-cov-2 fig 7
shows with different resolution microscopic images of the halyard h600 material it is composed to fibers but the density might not be sufficient to filter the particles used in our investigation there are also tiny holes in the pockets visible which could be the reason why the aerosol passes through the material as the flow resistance at the holes is low compared to the other parts of the materialthe flow tests clearly show that apart from the vacuum cleaner bag and the ffp3 mask the filter effect of the tested materials is not sufficient to protect against droplet infection reliably if the environment is contaminated with sars-cov-2 even masks routinely used by medical staff in hospitals and doctors offices have almost no significant filtering effect on the droplet sizes typically produced when breathing speaking singing and coughing the results are therefore in good agreement with the results from leung et al 2020 and davies et al 2013 and kwok et al 2015 but why has wearing these masks been shown to provide effective protection against infection with the virus in the sars epidemic as shown in leung et al 2003 lo et al 2005 and seto et al 2003 because a mask is important not only because of its filtering ability but to limit the droplet propagation as discussed in section 31 so in combination with distances these mask can protect if only a few people are infected in the surrounding the results in bae et al 2020 leung et al 2020 are correct but they do not consider the full performance of masks but only a partial aspect therefore the conclusions in the articles are not universal the findings in leung et al 2003 lo et al 2005 seto et al 2003 are understandable when the full performance of masks in blocking infections is consideredunfortunately wearing a simple mouth-and-nose cover may be less comfortable than wearing a particle filtering face mask in effect this can promote a smear infection since all these transmissions of infection are possible in daily life wearing a comfortable mask is essential to block human-to-human transmission by smear and droplet infection to ensure the best possible protection a particle filtering mask should be used if the number of infected persons in the environment and the viral load in the room is unknown at present social distancing practices and universal masking wearing seem to be the best methods of containing viral pandemic without stricter lockdown policies and without vaccinessome recent studies show that even the simple materials we have tested have some filtering ability davies et al 2013 drewnick 2020 konda et al 2020 and van der sande et al 2008 we do not question these results although the pressure drops in one study is anomalously low see supporting information in konda et al 2020 but we state explicitly that a material that does not have an adequate filtering ability equivalent to an ffp2n95kn95 mask cannot be recommended as a filter material for self-protection against droplet infection statistically speaking every loss of performance leads to an increase in the number of infected people and thus to an increase in the number of death it is therefore very dangerous to recommend materials with some filtering properties as possible materials for self-protection masks but there is another important aspect that will be discussed nextaccording to the previous section one might argue that a mouth-and-nose cover or surgical mask made of a good filter material would provide good protection against infection when infected people are in the vicinity or the room is contaminated with viruses but that will not usually be the case air takes the path of least resistance as these masks do not seal tightly enough with the face droplets can flow unhindered past the edge of the mask when inhaled and exhaled and reach the lungs or the environment if the mask does not fit properly this will even be the rule this is illustrated in fig 8
were a person is exhaling air during an easy exhalation without physical exertion left strong breathing during physical exertion middle and when coughing right the first video in the supplementary material shows the animated sequencesthe analysis shows that it is very important do differentiate between mouth-and-nose cover surgical mask and particle filtering respirator mask because they differ substantial in their fundamental protection properties face masks can offer three fundamental different kind of protection1they effectively prevents a smear infection as the wearers of the masks no longer perform their habitual grip on the face and thus no longer bring the virus from the hand into the mouth or nose howard et al 20202the flow resistance of the mask greatly limits the spread of viruses in the room this significantly reduces the risk of infection in the vicinity of an infected person protection of third parties3the inhalation of droplets containing viruses can be prevented by using a tight-fitting mask with particle filtering properties self-protection
the first fundamental protection mechanism can be reached by all face masks if they fit well and sit comfortably if not the user will touch the face even more than usual to correct the fit of the mask as this can increase the risk of smear infection a good fit of the mask is very important the first and second fundamental protection mechanisms are fulfilled by all masks that have sufficient flow resistance if the mask is worn and a candle can easily be blown out despite the mask the mask does not fulfil this function and should not be used all three fundamental protection mechanisms can be only achieved with ffp2n95kn95 or better particle filtering respirator masktypical materials currently used by the public to build masks reduce the risk of smear infection and effectively prevent the widespread spread of viruses in the environment therefore the use of these mouse-and-nose covers and surgical masks are very important to prevent smear infection and droplet infection to others if the distance is not too close as these masks do not have a significant particle-filtering protective effect against droplets that are typically produced when breathing speaking singing coughing and sneezing they should not be used if the environment is contaminated like in hospitals even when the distance rules are followed to achieve effective self-protection in a virus-contaminated environment masks with particle filtering properties ffp2n95kn95 are absolutely necessary from our point of view if a large number of infected persons are present and distance rules cannot be achieved a very good particle filtration mask ffp3 or better is strongly recommendedif these general rules are followed and all people use suitable particle-filtering respirators correctly the transmission of viruses via dropletsaerosols can be effectively prevented otherwise these types of masks would never have received certification nor would they be a core component of the personal protective equipment in hospitals and other environments therefore proper face masks can save lives while maintaining social life and securing the economy and the statebut universal masking alone is not enough for two reasons first many people are not very good at following rules consistently therefore it is advisable to observe the rules of hygiene and distance and to be careful even when wearing a mask in the event of a car accident the occupants are also protected by various devices bumpers crumple zone safety belts airbags head and legroom autonomous assistance systems  second some people are extremely bad at following rules either because they do not want to or because they simply cannot these people can become super spreaders therefore the early detection of sources of infection and their isolation remains important beside universal masking and the rules of hygiene and distancecoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 belonging to the coronavirus family an infected person may experience symptoms after an incubation period that could vary from about 2 to 14 days there have rarely been cases of incubation periods of 29 days during which time the person could still be contagious to limit transmission precautions should be taken such as adopting careful personal hygiene washing hands frequently and wearing masks coronavirus mainly affects the lower respiratory tract and causes a number of symptoms described as flu-like including fever cough shortness of breath muscle pain tiredness and gastrointestinal complaints such as diarrhea in severe cases pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome sepsis and septic shock could occur up to the death of the patient among the collective preventive measures it should be noted that in 2003 during the sars epidemic the major collective catering companies in china and hong kong adopted the obligation to wear surgical masks for their service personnel to protect both the workers of companies and the public this professional category is particularly exposed to potentially infectious contacts both active and passive in the same way a person in charge of equipment who is not equipped with the appropriate personal protective equipment ppe will find themselves exposed to contact with the dirty dishes and recent food remains of a large number of customers further interventions in the restaurant sector may include a prohibition on the distribution of buffets for both food and dishes 1234in recent weeks there has been about a great deal of discussion about the contamination and decontamination of inanimate surfaces in fact the duration before inactivation of the covid-19 virus on surfaces liquid solid or gaseous is still debated in most cases the spread between people occurs through the respiratory droplets emitted by an infected individual through coughing or sneezing which are subsequently inhaled by a healthy person who is nearby this also caused an initial diffidence on the part of people in purchasing products of any kind coming including by post from the areas affected by the epidemic leading to economic damage it is possible to become infected by touching surfaces or objects where the virus is present and then bringing your hands towards your mouth nose or eyes 5678910 in ideal conditions the virus can in fact persist on different surfaces for hours or days the surfaces most exposed to this type of transmission include for exampledoor handleslift or light buttonsmobile phonespublic transport handholds 11121314the viral titration viral assay or viral count is the count made in the laboratory of the number of viral particles of a given virus under examination present in a biological sample it is used in microbiological research diagnostics and in the production of antiviral vaccinesall situations that require knowledge of the amount of virus being analyzed or used we used tissue-culture infectious dose tcid per milliliter for covid-19 persistence evaluation 1516171819the aim of this article is to evaluate through the analysis of the current literature how long this virus can remain active on different surfaces it is too early to be able to carry out a review with meta-analysis of the literature given the incredible relevance of this topic but it is certainly a step to clarify this pandemicthe following questions were used to develop the study framework according to the pico populationinterventioncomparisonoutcomes guidelineswhat is the persistence of sars-cov-2 on surfaceswhat is the mean persistence of coronaviruses compared to sars-cov-2an investigation methods protocol was used according to the prisma statement the aim of the prisma statement is to help authors improve the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses it can be used as a basis for reporting reviews of other types of research the use of checklists like prisma is likely to improve the reporting quality of a systematic review and provides substantial transparency in the selection process of papers in a systematic review furthermore pico guidelines have been used to prepare summary questions 202122the full texts of all studies related to the main revision topics were obtained for comparing the inclusion parameterssars-cov-2 features

studies were obtained after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria only the remaining 5 articles were further analyzed then articles were manually selected and finally 4 articles were obtained figure 1 results of individual studies were shown after an accurate analysis in table 1 the aim of this table is to summarize coronaviruses persistence timevan doremalen et al 26 evaluated the stability of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 in aerosols and different surfaces they evaluated these viruses decay rates using bayesian linear regression they conducted their experiment using aerosols  5 m containing sars-cov-2 10525 50 tissue-culture infectious dose tcid50 per milliliter or sars-cov-1 10675-700 tcid50 per milliliter generated by a nebulizer ten different experimental conditions involving sars-cov-1 or 2 were evaluated results on infectious titer reduction are shown in table 1 the data were expressed as 50 tissue-culture infectious dose tcid50 it is important to specify that the limit of detection for this experiment was 333  1005 tcid50 per liter of air for aerosols 1005 tcid50 per milliliter of medium for plastic steel and cardboard and 1015 tcid50 per milliliter of medium for copper kampf et al 27 showed how different coronaviruses could persist on different types of inanimate surfaces they also evaluated some environmental characteristics such as temperature or humidity they showed how human coronavirus could be influenced by temperature as 30 or 40 c reduced the duration of persistence of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces however at the temperature of 4 c the persistence could be greater than or equal to 28 days another important result is that the persistence was longer with higher inocula warnes et al 28 evaluated coronaviruses persistence on metal and non-metal samples they inoculated 103 plaque forming units pfu on different materials polyfluorotetraethylene teflon ptfe polyvinyl chloride pvc ceramic tiles glass and stainless steel coronaviruses persistence was at least 5 days and 3 days for silicon rubber at 21 c despite this it could be rapidly inactivated by brass and copper nickel surfaces in less than 60 min copper nickel surfaces were effective but less than brass copper in these cases the inactivation time was up to 5 min in the fingertip contamination model warnes et al demonstrated how a higher percentage of copper could lead to superior antiviral properties another important factor reported in this study was that the release of ions from copper and the formation of reactive oxygen species ros take part in the deactivation of the virus furthermore the authors report that following an analysis carried out with a transmission electron microscope tem the virus was normally present on common surfaces such as stainless steel but on copper surfaces it appeared to be damaged and intact particles were fewit was not possible to conduct a bias risk analysis according to the prisma statement as specified in the previous section unfortunately the limited number of articles obtained does not allow for the realization of a systematic review the individual studies were analyzed and the experiments leading to the results shown in table 1 were rigorously conducted and are repeatable analyses 29the literature concerning the characteristics of these viruses is still scarce especially if one considers only covid-19 the aspects related to the persistence of the virus on surfaces not only represent an environmental and public health problem concerning schools roads offices it is a much bigger problem if hospitals operating theaters and sanitary waiting rooms are considered especially in the new and continuously increasing covid departments knowing how the virus behaves in contact with surfaces and with different disinfectants could be important for the sanitization of medical environments in particular some authors deal with the optimization of infection control in operating rooms some devices are used in hospital operating rooms for single use only but other devices surfaces handles and cords could be transmission vehicles 30 ong et al 2020 31 evaluated the presence of coronavirus in a hospital room of covid-19 patients some surfaces such as the toilet bowl and the sink were positive room air samples and samples collected after cleaning were negative the time span varied according to the characteristics of the type of surface the less-porous ones like plastic and steel were the worst because they absorb droplets less easily preserving the active virus additionally the different environmental conditions could affect the amount of ventilation of the rooms and the humidity 26 according to van doremalen et al 26 aerosol and surface virus transmission is plausible since it can remain viable and infectious for hours or days kampf et al 27 showed how human coronaviruses can remain infectious on surfaces for up to 9 days at room temperature this is an important factor about coronaviruses spread from this it is easy to see that if someone tends to touch the environment oftenespecially if not properly disinfectedthe possibility of becoming infected increases furthermore the droplets present in the form of an aerosol of an infected patient can not only easily spread but also easily settle and last for several hours on a surface kampf et al 27 investigated different biocidal agents on coronaviruses they demonstrated how ethanol 7895 2-propanol 70100 the combination of 45 2-propanol with 30 1-propanol glutardialdehyde 0525 formaldehyde 071 and povidone iodine 02375 readily inactivated coronavirus infectivity by approximately 4 log10 or more sodium hypochlorite required a minimal concentration of at least 021 to be effective hydrogen peroxide was effective with a concentration of 05 and an incubation time of 1 min an important finding is the ineffectiveness of chlorhexidine within 10 min a concentration of 02 revealed no efficacy against coronavirus it is a result that does not support some guidelines for dentistry 32 kampf et al 27 concluded that these viruses can remain on surfaces up to 9 days and that surface disinfection could be performed with 01 sodium hypochlorite or 6271 ethanol for 1 minute according to warnes et al 26 coronavirus persists in an infectious state on surfaces for several days warnes et al 26 demonstrated the survival of coronaviruses on different surfaces for up to 5 days concerning the persistence of the virus on different surfaces and in particular on metals containing copper these findings are interesting and could lead to the development of new surfaces with viricidal or bactericidal properties in confined environments especially if poorly ventilated viral particles of less than 01 m in size may remain in the environment as a secondary aerosol studies on the topic indicate that a sneeze could release up to 2 million droplets into the air less than a million from a cough and about 3000 from speaking out loud the droplets eliminated from the airways if larger than 100 m from a height of 2 m settle on flat surfaces in 36 s and reach horizontally about 15 m away then evaporate rapidly dry and become solid material this material reaches a size of 23 m studies on tuberculosis have shown that this material maintaining its infectious capacity could be inhaled and thanks to its size reach the most peripheral parts of the lungs becoming a secondary biological aerosol 26 there has not been much discussion about the importance of ventilating environments to prevent sars-cov-2 infection and although the viral particles have not been studied sufficiently for their ability to achieve dangerous concentrations from a distance in confined environments increased ventilation in an environment is believed to reduce the cross-infection of airborne diseases therefore existing recommendations could be amended to include ventilating public spaces including means of transport with suitable means it is essential to focus on preventing infection by using ventilation suitable to reduce the infectious capacity of the coronavirus it has been widely demonstrated that natural ventilation causes better air exchange compared to mechanical ventilationup to 69 changes per hour of rooms when the windows are completely open 33 most international guidelines recommend about 12 changes per hour for isolation rooms in case of infections medical and dental staff will have to work safely and this is complicated by the fact that there are still no official guidelines that tell them how to behavemoreover as suggested by spagnuolo et al dentists should avoid the scheduling of any patient only such urgent dental diseases can be considered during the covid-19 outbreak the waiting time of patients in dental offices could highly predispose patients to be infected when dentists treat patients they should intercept potentially infected persons before they reach the operating areas for example identifying those with a fever measuring 375 c and posing a few questions about the patients general health status in the last 7 days and about the risk of having been in contact with other infected persons dentists as well as medical office employees should always be covered by facial masks and they should remind patients to maintain the 1-m distance with each other during their waiting time 3435disinfecting surfaces is one of the aspects to which to give greater attention being done with the detergents already in use today along with the washing of hands and the use of suitable ppe in regards to ppe surgical masks must be used by those who could transmit the virus but those who work in contact with the patients aerosol must use ffp2 and ffp3 filtering facepiece particles masks there should only be one patient in waiting rooms this is also true in clinical areas in the case of minors who need an escort the escort must be at a distance from operators and must wear a surgical mask at the end of each session the surfaces will then have to be cleaned and the air exchanged the same procedures should be adopted in the waiting room and in other areas where the patient might pass or touch objects certainly some tools such as quick tests once validated can become useful in the hands of the doctordentist to understand if the patient or some member of their team is potentially infectedwe are aware of the limitations of this article it is not possible to make a review of the literature due to the lack of data so this is only a summary of the available information further studies are needed in order to verify the persistence times of coronavirus on surfaces more precisely however we have considered proceeding with the creation of this summary while respecting the guidelines of systematic reviews and also not having sufficient numbers the reason for this choice lies in the incredible topicality and reliability of the data obtained with the hope that this work could be widely and immediately used to contain the pandemicthe purpose of this summary is to draw a line and clarify the characteristics of sars-cov-2 with regard to its persistence on surfaces this article is of great interest and could be used to write new guidelines by epidemiologists having a clear summary of the current situation from our analysis it is possible to deduce some aspects the virus can reach surfaces in the form of an aerosol therefore following nebulization through people sneezing or coughing or electromedical machinery infection via surfaces should be considered since the latter could remain viable and infectious for hours or days on average the different coronaviruses persist in an infectious state on surfaces for several days even up to nine surface disinfection could be performed with 01 sodium hypochlorite or 6271 ethanol for 1 minute copper has shown antiviral propertiesso much so that the virus appears damaged or altered on copper surfacesother experiments are certainly needed on different surfaces or even on biological surfaces to better understand the persistence times of this virus and promote adequate standardsin behavior analysis behavior under the control of direct environmental contingencies is distinguished from behavior under the control of rules hayes barnes-holmes  roche 2001 relational frame theory rft can offer important insights into rule-governed behavior allowing researchers to develop functional-analytic interpretations of how rules are understood ohora  barnes-holmes 2004 rule-governed behavior in accordance with rft is an increasingly popular research avenue kissi et al 2017 ruiz surez-falcn barbero-rubio  flrez 2019 stapleton  mchugh 2020 that is of particular interest during the current coronavirus covid-19 pandemic as authorities implement new public health measures to reduce the spread of covid-19 it is extremely important to understand how individuals respond to these new rules particularly whether they are likely to followbreak themthis paper describes why an individual may understand the rules and restrictions in place during the covid-19 pandemic but still choose not to comply determining why a rule may be understood but not followed is important if we are to influence behavior i will begin by presenting a brief overview of rule-following in accordance with rft illustrated using a covid-19 specific example next drawing from rft research cognitive neuroscience social psychology and health literature i will present reasons why a rule may be understood but not followed with suggestions for reducing the probability of rule-breaking in the context of pandemic restrictions presented throughout it is important to note that this paper adopts the rft perspective of rule-governed behavior wherein rules include verbal antecedents hayes gifford  hayes 1998 i use the term rule as a general means to orient readers towards a particular behavioral class i use speaker to refer to the rule-giver and listener to refer to the rule-recipient although these can be the same person adherence and compliance are treated as translational concepts tied to rule-followingconsider the following scenario an individual hears a representative from the world health organization advise that if we are to reduce the spread of covid-19 we must maintain at least 1 meter of distance between ourselves and others the individual listens and understands this rule as i must engage in social distancing in order to reduce the spread of covid-19 consequently because the individual wants to reduce the spread of covid-19 they avoid crowds and getting too close to others in this instance the individual is both understanding and following a rule delivered by the world health organizationthe account of rule-governed behavior in accordance with rft provides insight into how this rule was understood specifically via relational frames organized into a network word classes eg covid-19 are framed in coordination ie the same as with some event classes eg the actual covid-19 virus and distinction with others ie the actual act of social distancing reducing covid-19 is framed conditionally ie if-then with engaging in social distancing this rule alters the functions of getting close to others with transformations of stimulus function connecting the act of social distancing to the consequence of reducing the spread of covid-19 when the individual is in close proximity with others if the individual accurately discriminates their behavior in that moment then it is no longer the same experience its function has been transformed due to its participation in a relational network the individual has built based on the rule that the world health organisation delivered see figure 1
in this example the individual understood the rule and the required response was already established in their behavioral repertoire ie the individual knew how to engage in social distancing however a rule may be understood the required response may be established in the listeners repertoire and yet the listener may choose to not follow the rule hayes et al 1998 barnes-holmes et al 2001 list ways to approach an individuals decision to not follow a rule despite having the relevant behaviors available in their repertoire similarly based on the literature underpinning the cognitive neuroscience of habits vahey bennett and whelan 2017 describe features of instrumental behavior which make it particularly likely to become habitual given that this bank of habit research is compatible with rft vahey et al 2017 offer important insights into why a listener may not adhere to guidelines aiming to reduce the spread of covid-19 drawing on barnes-holmes et al 2001 and vahey et al 2017 i will now present a brief overview of why an individual may understand the rules and restrictions in place during the covid-19 pandemic but opt to not follow the rules despite their importancea rule is less likely to be followed if it is provided by someone that the listener perceives as having little credibility barnes-holmes et al 2001 trneke et al 2008 credibility may be acquired directly or verbally with formal or relational means of generalization from one speaker to another barnes-holmes et al 2001 for example if a listener perceives a speaker as knowledgeable then they are more likely to follow rules delivered by this speaker because being knowledgeable is perceived as an apparent predictor of rule accuracythe influence of speaker credibility on rule-following has been observed in the literature on compliance and obedience for example milgram 1974 observed that when a uniformed experimenter was replaced by an ordinary member of the public confederate obedience drastically decreased one of many interpretations for this finding is that participants likely perceived the ordinary member of the public as less credible ie participants perceived rules delivered by ordinary members of the public as less accurate than rules delivered by a uniformed expert beyond the compliance literature recent research has shown health information source credibility significantly impacts the way individuals receive the message with greater perceived credibility associated with greater intention to act on the advice lin hwang  lai 2017 wang walther pingree  hawkins 2008 there is some preliminary rft evidence supporting the existence of variability in rule-following in accordance with speaker credibility specifically despite employing a similar methodology baruch kanter busch richardson and barnes-holmes 2007 and mcauliffe hughes and barnes-holmes 2014 observed different patterns in rule-governed behavior in the former study rules were delivered by a graduate student whereas in the latter rules were delivered by a catholic priest and teacher at the participants school while baruch et al 2007 and mcauliffe et al 2014 differed in other important ways eg the use of raffle ticket reinforcers versus guaranteed reinforcers speaker credibility would appear to impact rule-governed behavior ie students likely perceived the teacher as highly credible based on their learning histories and therefore adhered to their rulesin the context of rule-following during the covid-19 pandemic if an individual does not perceive the speaker delivering health advice as credible then they are less likely to adhere to the recommendations why should i do as they say what would they know for example you may be more likely to adhere to regulations presented by a representative from the world health organization than your aunt on your facebook timeline therefore in order to promote adherence to rules speakers must be established as credible it is important to note that overemphasizing credibility can promote rigid rule-following villatte villatte  hayes 2016 in an ideal world a speaker would be established as credible by encouraging the listener to track whether their rules are accurate luciano valdivia-salas  ruiz 2012a rule is less likely to be followed if the listener believes the speaker has limited capacity to mediate consequences barnes-holmes et al 2001 specifically rule deviations can stem from listeners perception of limited speaker ability and willingness to mediate consequences andor their verbally ascribed powers of authority trneke et al 2008 for example in the context of ability to mediate consequences a child may follow rules delivered by their parent but not their sibling because reinforcers are delivered by the former trneke et al 2008 in the context of authority a child may not adhere to rules delivered by their stepdad i dont have to do as you say youre not my real dad although linked to speaker credibility this approach to understanding why listeners may not follow rules differs in that it is not the apparent accuracy of the rule but perceived availability of consequences that is of interestreturning to the compliance literature authority and perceived ability to mediate consequences do appear to impact rule-following an alternative interpretation of the aforementioned milgram 1974 uniform variation study is that participants believed the ordinary member of the public was less able to enforce consequences for rule compliancenon-compliance therefore the participant is less likely to comply with rules delivered by the confederate than those delivered by the experimenter similarly bickman 1974 reported that individuals were more likely to comply with rules delivered by a guard than a civilian or milkman this could be due to participants perceiving guards as having a greater capacity to enforce consequences eg enforcing a fine for non-compliance in the context of authority both the milgram 1974 and bickman 1974 examples could be interpreted as participants believing they must do as experimentersguards say within the rft literature authority does appear to impact rule-following donadeli and strapasson 2015 found that monitoring increased the probability that the participants would follow rules with participants exposed to verbal reprimands maintaining rule-following even when it was no longer advantageous to do so in this study the presence of an authoritative figure ie the experimenter who knew whether rules were being followed and would reprimand participants increased rule-followingin the context of rule-following during the covid-19 pandemic if a speaker does not have the authoritydoes not appear to be able to mediate consequences for following the rule then a listener will be less likely to adhere to their rules what right have you to enforce these rules what will you do if i dont follow these rules for example an armed guard telling you to wear personal protective equipment will likely be more effective in producing rule-following than your younger sibling telling you the same thing ie the guard has authority and an ability to deliver consequences that your younger sibling does not therefore in order to promote adherence to rules speakers should ensure the listener believes they have authority and can deliver consequences for non-compliance for example a government official presenting restrictions for social distancing in line with recommendations from the world health organisation ie they have authority may refer to guards patrolling the streets to monitor individuals rule-following ie they can enforce consequencesa rule is less likely to be followed if the listener perceives it as implausible barnes-holmes et al 2001 simply put if a rules relational network is contradictory or incoherent with the listeners learning history it is less likely to be followed trneke et al 2008 for example consider the rule if you want to predict and influence behavior then you must adopt a mechanistic approach and focus on describing behavior for functional contextualists this rule would be incoherent with their existing relational networks and thus is unlikely to be followed related to rule plausibility is perceived self-efficacy wherein the extent to which the listener believes they can follow the rule impacts whether it is followed barnes-holmes et al 2001 simply put if an individual believes they are incapable of successfully engaging in the behaviors specified in the rule then they are less likely to follow the rulethe influence of rule plausibility has been addressed in treatment adherence literature for example if a physician wants to improve an individuals adherence to a regimentreatment plan then the physician must acquire an understanding of the individuals knowledge and perception of the proposed treatment martin williams haskard  dimatteo 2005 patient involvement and participatory decision making can increase rule-following by allowing physicians to address perceived incoherencies martin et al 2005 similarly this approach allows the individual to examine perceived self-efficacy and work with their physician to tailor regimens as required moreover individuals with higher levels of health literacy report greater adherence than those with lower health literacy miller 2016 one interpretation of this finding is that rules regarding treatment are more coherent ie plausible for individuals with high health literacy meaning they are more likely to be followed within the rft literature there is tentative support for the influence of rule plausibility on rule-following consider experimental work on pliance and tracking involving contingency insensitivity eg oconnor byrne ruiz  mchugh 2019 during these experiments reward and punishment contingencies are systematically modified ie responses that were previously reinforced are no longer reinforced while responses that were previously not reinforced are now reinforced during contingency shifting phases participants may begin to form new rules about what will maximize their access to reinforcers however these new rules are incoherent with the previous rules and therefore are less likely to be followed right awayin the context of rule-following during the covid-19 pandemic if a rule is contradictory or incoherent with the listeners learning history then it is unlikely to be followed for example even if an authoritative figure tells you that injecting disinfectant may kill the virus you are unlikely to attempt this if your learning history allows you to frame ingesting disinfectant in opposition to staying alive therefore in order to promote adherence to evidence-based rules to reduce the spread of covid-19 speakers must ensure their rules are sensical within listeners learning histories extending listeners relational networks as required this will be particularly important when professionals are communicating with the public about covid-19 immunity eg covid-19 is not the same as the chickenpox so claims about immunity may be incoherent for some regarding perceived self-efficacy a listener must believe they can follow the rule this could be achieved by reassuring listeners of their capabilities modifying the rule based on listener feedback or even teaching the listener how to follow the rulea rule is less likely to be followed if it does not feature adequate motivative augmentals barnes-holmes et al 2001 motivative augmentals change the reinforcing value of consequences specified in the rule temporarily altering the degree to which established consequences serve as reinforcers or punishers ju  hayes 2008 trneke et al 2008 simply put motivative augmentals alter our interest in existing consequences villatte et al 2016 this is often achieved by bringing distant consequences to the present via language or encouraging clients to contact natural and social reinforcers barnes-holmes et al 2001 ju  hayes 2008 villatte et al 2016 connecting a rule to an individuals valueswhat matters to them makes it more likely to be followedthe influence of motivation on rule-following has been addressed in treatment adherence literature with greater motivation linked to greater adherence to rules varming hansen andrsdttir husted  willaing 2015 vermeire hearnshaw van royen  denekens 2001 in the context of health when appropriate physicians can establish motivative augmentals by ensuring patients perceive their medical conditions to be serious and understand that they are at risk if they do not change atreja bellam  levy 2005 consider the following example of an individual aged 65 who has chronic lung disease in the context of the covid-19 pandemic when first advised to cocoon ie stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact they did not comply due to low perceived self-efficacy i cant cope with being cooped up for that long however after speaking to their physician they were informed that unless they cocoon they are in immediate danger following this the individual began cocooning despite previous failed attempts to do so in this example the individual evaluates the immediate effects of following the rule less negatively by valuing the consequences of following the rule more highly ie coping with being cooped up is less aversive than being in immediate danger in line with this within the rft literature researchers have demonstrated that consequences may be altered in accordance with comparative framing whelan barnes-holmes  dymond 2006in the context of rule-following during the covid-19 pandemic a rule is less likely to be followed if it is not linked to what the listener cares about why should i stay at home im not going to die if i get sick for example individuals may break lockdown restrictions to meet up with friends if they do not believe they are at risk to reconnect rules to what matters to listeners speakers should set up appropriate motivative augmentals for example imagine now that the individuals breaking lockdown are reminded that they are putting their family members at risk you may not get sick and die but you could infect your family and they could get sick if this reminder changes the probability of these individuals breaking lockdown then it is functioning as an adequate motivative augmental it is important to note that listeners likely endorse different values which means that the motivative augmentals that function for one group will not necessarily work with another eg reminders that family members are at risk if you break lockdown are only likely to reduce rule-breaking if you care about your family membersa rule is less likely to be followed if the behavior specified in the rule is not habitual for example if i want to reduce my risk of contracting covid-19 i must avoid touching my face from a cognitive neuroscience perspective habitual behavior is emitted regardless of shifts in the contingencies that originally influenced it bouton winterbauer  todd 2012 with habits arising from an overall history of reinforcement for emitting the particular response vahey et al 2017 wood  rnger 2016 simply put habits are cognitively efficient automatic and inflexible vahey et al 2017 therefore if the behaviors specified in the rule directly conflict with the listeners habits then the listener may be less likely to follow the rule in favor of cognitive efficiency particularly if performing a secondary task ruh cooper  mareschal 2010drawing on cognitive neuroscience literature vahey et al 2017 describe features of habit behavior that elucidate how habits may interfere with rule-following specifically cognitive neuroscience data suggest that instrumental behaviors are particularly likely to become habitual when they are relatively straightforward and reinforced consistently in a stable environment where intensive reinforcement is delivered for a prolonged time period ostlund  balleine 2008 vahey et al 2017 wood  rnger 2016 these features appear to relate to plausibility and reinforcer availability in addition vahey et al 2017 suggest that instrumental behavior is particularly likely to become habitual when subject to variable interval schedules of reinforcement and the individual is disinclined to deliberate about the behavior the latter of these could relate to authorityone of the most successful strategies for reducing interference from habits in daily life and experimental tasks involved attending to slip-ups and thinking dont do it quinn pascoe wood  neal 2010 this worked not by decreasing habit strength but by enhancing cognitive control ie the ability to focus on task-relevant information while inhibiting non-task-relevant information quinn et al 2010 another successful strategy involved tying inhibitory plans to cues that activate habits adriaanse et al 2010 conscious self-monitoring is central to reducing interference from habits in the context of rule-following during the covid-19 pandemic a listener may struggle to follow a rule which requires behavior that conflicts with their habits for example consider the rule if i want to reduce the spread of covid-19 then i must not shake hands at work meetings if shaking hands had become habitual for the listener they may need to consciously replace that action with a response that opposes the muscle movements required to shake hands eg waving instead providing people with suggestions for alternative opposing actions to replace habits will reduce habit interference and likely increase rule-followingcounterpliance is typically defined as rule-governed behavior under the control of socially-mediated consequences that are contacted by behaving in opposition to the behavior specified in the rule barnes-holmes et al 2001 hayes zettle  rosenfarb 1989 trneke et al 2008 functionally counterpliance is a form of pliance that can become problematic when generalized villatte et al 2016 simply put compliance and rebellion are two sides of the same coin but how socially mediated consequences are delivered may differ hayes et al 1989 it is important to note that while counterpliance often involves a listener behaving in direct opposition to the given rule this need not be the case an individual can not do as they are told without behaving in opposition per se for example consider the im not touching you game that is popular among siblings in this game the individual avoids touching their sibling but intentionally comes close to doing so this typically annoys their sibling who asks them to stop touching the individual is technically not touching their sibling and is technically adhering to their siblings request however the individual is aware that their sibling meant for them to stop almost touching them in a similar vein counterpliance may be understood as rule-governed behavior under the control of a history of socially-mediated reinforcement for a lack of correspondence between the rule and relevant behavior simply put counterpliance occurs when a listener intentionally does not follow the rule they believe the speaker intendedwhile there has been a dearth of rft research on counterpliance it is highly relevant to rule-following and rule-breaking in the context of rule-following during the covid-19 pandemic a listener may not adhere to rules based on a history of peer support for behavior that explicitly deviates from established rules for example an adolescent may intentionally break rules around personal protective equipment removing their mask in public and fake coughing in order to receive negative attention the social psychology literature provides important insights into ways to manage counterpliance referred to as reactance in this body of literature from this perspective reactance serves to reestablish an individuals sense of freedom steindl jonas sittenthaler traut-mattausch  greenberg 2015 and is extremely similar to counterpliance reactance is less likely to occur when rule-following is monitored and the contingencies for rule-following are stronger than those for rule-breaking hayes et al 1989 steindl et al 2015 this appears to relate to authority and reinforcer availabilityin the context of rule-following during the covid-19 pandemic reynolds-tylus 2019 is particularly useful reynolds-tylus 2019 presents features of persuasive health communications that are likely to impact reactance freedom-threatening language message sensation and other-referencing messages are of particular importance in the pandemic context regarding freedom-threatening language while messages with the objective of enacting behavior change must be direct in advocating for specific actions explicit messages are more likely to incite reactance due to their freedom threatening nature reynolds-tylus 2019 regarding message sensation messages that are high in sensation value ie are dramatic exciting and novel are perceived as more persuasive with high sensation and low controlling language perceived as most effective xu 2015 regarding other-referencing messages ie messages that emphasize the influence of individuals choices on others relative to self-referencing messages other-referencing messages incited less reactance with participants responding more favorably to both the message and advocated health behaviors gardner  leshner 2016 therefore when attempting to reduce counterpliance while communicating rules to reduce the spread of covid-19 speakers should ensure messages have a high sensation value and are other-referencing in nature speakers should also ensure to balance freedom-threatening language with the need to explicitly advocate for specific behaviorsas authorities establish rules and restrictions to reduce the spread of covid-19 it is important to understand what makes adherence more probabilistic rft allows us to understand how listeners interpret and respond to rules barnes-holmes et al 2001 drawing on work from barnes-holmes et al 2001 vahey et al 2017 cognitive neuroscience social psychology and health literature this paper identified important considerations for implementing public health measures to reduce the spread of covid-19 specifically speakers should attend to their credibility authority and ability to mediate consequences rule plausibility establishing adequate motivative augmental control whether the behavior specified in the rule opposes habits and whether the message incites counterpliance these guidelines may be of use to applied researchers developing public health interventions to promote rule-following while strict rule-following in every single context is undoubtedly problematic in the context of a global pandemic we must be able to promote adherence to rules based on guidelines and evidence from appropriate organizationsnonethis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectorsit seems to be conventional wisdom that genetically homogeneous populations suffer from more severe pathogen outbreaks than diverse populations elton 1958 sherman et al 1988 schmid-hempel 1998 altizer et al 2003 infection is more likely to be transmitted between genetically similar hosts anderson and may 1986 and upon encountering resistant hosts parasites would likely die fail to successfully reproduce anderson and may 1986 or otherwise be removed from the population keesing et al 2006 as such the risk of infection especially by virulent pathogens may select for outcrossing over uniparental forms reproduction such as self-fertilization or parthenogenesis jokela et al 2009 king et al 2009 morran et al 2011 resulting in an overall increase in genetic diversity king et al 2011 there may not seem to be an escape from disease but genetic diversity in host populations may reduce the risk of infectionthe empirical link between disease spread and genetic diversity has its origin in agricultural research agricultural fields represent environments in which plants are selected for high yield and may therefore exhibit less genetic polymorphism than those in the wild it is well known that disease epidemics have devastated agricultural monocultures for example rice blast zhu et al 2000 and that monocultures are typically more susceptible to outbreaks than diverse mixtures of crops mundt 2002 this association between low diversity and high disease incidence is called the monoculture effect for example elton 1958 leonard 1969 garrett and mundt 1999 zhu et al 2000 pilet et al 2006 here we examine how genetic diversity affects the spread of disease in natural populations we also consider the theoretical basis for the monoculture effect in host populations and suggest that there may be a diversity threshold for disease spreadthe most notable examples of the monoculture effect in natural populations come from the dramatic epidemics in small populations of endangered species particularly mammals for example obrien et al 1985 thorne and williams 1988 genetic bottlenecks have reduced the genetic variability in cheetahs particularly at the major histocompatibility complex and endangered populations of these animals have been decimated by coronavirus epizootics obrien et al 1985 similarly the endangered black-footed ferret may have been extirpated from its natural habitat because low genetic diversity aided the spread of a virulent canine distemper epizootic thorne and williams 1988range expansion and habitat isolation caused by human activities can also generate small founder populations with low genetic diversity newly-colonised western populations of italian agile frogs rana latastei are genetically depauperate and they have an increased susceptibility to a novel emerging ranavirus pearman and garner 2005 similarly dam construction in the senegal river basin likely permitted the rapid expansion of snails biomphalaria pfeifferi  which serve as the first-intermediate host for the human disease schistosomiasis campbell et al 2010 recently established biomphalaria snail populations are genetically homogenous compared with those in natural habitats in zimbabwe they are also more susceptible to infection and this increases the opportunity for parasite transmission to humans campbell et al 2010by reducing individual-level and population-level genetic heterozygosity inbreeding can increase host susceptibility to infectious parasites dwyer et al 1997 acevedo-whitehouse et al 2003 spielman et al 2004 ellison et al 2011 in wild populations acevedo-whitehouse et al 2003 found that heavily inbred california sea lions were more infected and consequently may act as pathogen reservoirs spreading parasites in sea lion populations but is increased susceptibility directly due to reduced diversity or does inbreeding depression have an effect by compromising host condition by manipulating the levels of inbreeding in drosophila melanogaster in laboratory experiments spielman et al 2004 confirmed that the increase in disease susceptibility resulted from a lower frequency of resistance alleles in the population and not by generalized inbreeding effects inbreeding effects were similarly excluded as a reason for why offspring from inbred populations of daphnia a freshwater crustacean were more susceptible to a vertically-transmitted parasite than those from outbred populations ebert et al 2007 finally kerstes and wagner 2012 found that inbreeding increased parasite-induced mortality in the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum by prolonging development time but it did not increase susceptibility to infectionfounder populations provide the opportunity to examine the effects of inbreeding and small population size on the link between genetic diversity and parasite resistance for example in a comparison of founder versus ancestral mainland populations of deer mice meagher 1999 found that inbred island populations in lake michigan had higher infection levels and lower genetic diversity the link between diversity and parasite spread has even been revealed when comparing large and small founder populations hawks colonizing smaller galpagos islands possessed lower genetic diversity produced low antibody titer and had a higher abundance of parasites than more outbred populations on larger islands whiteman et al 2006uniparental forms of reproduction such as self-fertilization or parthenogenesis should have similar consequences for parasite resistance as biparental inbreeding along these lines self-fertilizing populations and inbred sexual populations were both found to have higher infection rates by a trematode parasite compared with outbred sexual populations of topminnows poeciliopsis monacha lively et al 1990 in another species of partially-selfing fish kryptolebias marmoratus ellison et al 2011 found that outcrossing increased the genetic diversity of wild populations and decreased their susceptibility to multiple parasitesmating systems can also directly affect genetic diversity and parasite resistance busch et al 2004 williams et al 2011 for example in eusocial insect colonies queens can mate with a single male or with multiple males polyandry which determines the level of relatedness among individuals within a colony high relatedness among individuals in a population can enhance the evolution of cooperation hamilton 1964a 1964b 1987 but the genetic similarity between individuals may also facilitate the spread of parasites shykoff and schmid-hempel 1991 schmid-hempel 1998 as such multiple mating has been suggested as an evolutionary response to parasite pressure hamilton 1987 sherman et al 1988 which may counteract the high risk of parasite transmission and increase the overall productivity of the colony schmid-hempel 1994 schmid-hempel and crozier 1999 brown and schmid-hempel 2003numerous studies on ants and bees have indeed found that multiply mated queens form more resistant colonies baer and schmid-hempel 1999 2001 tarpy 2003 hughes and boomsma 2004 tarpy and seeley 2006 seeley and tarpy 2007 and that offspring fathered by different males do vary in susceptibility to infection baer and schmid-hempel 2003 ultimately the balance between the costs for example within-colony conflict reduced offspring output and benefits for example resistance to a range of parasites associated with heterogeneity in colonies may determine the optimal level of polyandry baer and schmid-hempel 2001 van baalen and beekman 2006 polygyny the presence of multiple queens within a single colony can also decrease the relatedness among individuals and increase the variety of resistance alleles in the colony studies in which the number of founding queens was experimentally manipulated have confirmed that colonies founded by multiple queens have lower parasite loads liersch and schmid-hempel 1998 reber et al 2008 in addition workers from polygynous colonies of an ant cardiocondyla obscurior were better at detecting disease and removing infected individuals from the nest than workers from nests having a single queen ugelvig et al 2010increases in infection prevalence in the wild is associated with genetic bottlenecking and inbreeding induced by founder effects or mating systems thus host population genetic diversity seems to have an important role in buffering populations against epidemics but how exactly does genetic diversity reduce disease spreadan association between genetic diversity and disease spread might be detected by categorizing populations as being either genetically homogenous or diverse this comparative method can tell us that diversity matters but does not indicate the amount of genetic diversity required for a population to be resistant or the diversity threshold recently two insightful empirical studies have quantified the effect of genetic diversity on resistance in host populations altermatt and ebert 2008 and ganz and ebert 2010 conducted semi-natural mesocosm and lab experiments respectively whereby monoclonal and polyclonal daphnia populations were exposed to microparasites parasites spread significantly faster altermatt and ebert 2008 and infection rates are higher ganz and ebert 2010 in host monocultures compared with polycultures of several genotypes with higher allelic diversity these studies suggest that the relationship between host diversity and infection may not be complex and that a handful of host genotypes in the population can be enough to hamper parasite transmissionthe benefits of host genetic diversity however may also depend on the genetic diversity of the parasite population boomsma and ratnieks 1996 van baalen and beekman 2006 ganz and ebert 2010 if the parasite population is genetically homogenous increases in host population genetic diversity might boost the opportunity for parasites to encounter a susceptible host boomsma and ratnieks 1996 van baalen and beekman 2006 alternatively in a diverse parasite population there is a high probability that one of a diverse set of parasite genotypes can infect a homogeneous host population van baalen and beekman 2006 and genetically diverse host populations are at an advantage consistent with these ideas ganz and ebert 2010 found no difference in infection levels among experimental daphnia monocultures and polycultures when populations were exposed to a single-parasite genotype however polycultures were more resistant when populations were exposed to multiple parasite genotypesthere has been surprisingly little theoretical work on the effect of genetic diversity on disease spread two models suggest that genetic variation in host susceptibility would not affect infectious disease spread springbett et al 2003 yates et al 2006 but it might reduce the severity of infection springbett et al 2003 in these models hosts varied in susceptibility to a single pathogen strain but no host genotype was completely resistant to infection in contrast lively 2010a found that host genetic diversity could reduce the risk of disease spread assuming that each host genotype was susceptible to a different parasite genotype this assumption is consistent with the matching-alleles model for infection frank 1993 otto and michalakis 1998 the matching-alleles model is a useful framework for studying selfnon-self-recognition systems in animals and it is supported by studies on invertebrate immunity grosberg and hart 2000 carius et al 2001 dybdahl et al 2008 duneau et al 2011 luijckx et al 2011 in addition the framework seems robust to the assumption of single-genotype specificity agrawal and lively 2002 engelstaedter and bonhoeffer 2009the more recent model suggests that increases in the genetic diversity of host populations could have a large effect on disease spread and prevalence at equilibrium lively 2010a the model assumes that there are no co-infections and that each parasite genotype can only infect one genetically determined resistance phenotype in the host population which is the standard assumption of the matching-alleles model for infection the results suggest that r0 for each parasite genotype i depends on total host density as well as the frequency of the matching host genotype where matches between host and parasite genotypes yield an infection thus disease transmission is both density and frequency dependent the effect of host density on r0 is asymptotic on bgi where gi is the frequency of the matching host genotype and b is the number of parasite propagules produced by each infection that make contact with a host lively 2010a thus b is equal to the total number of propagules produced by an infection multiplied by the frequency of propagules that contact a host for large host populations n200 the effect of further increasing the host population size has little effect but increasing the number of host genotypes has a large effect because increasing the number of host genotypes decreases the frequency gi of each genotype under parasite-mediated frequency-dependent selection the frequency of each host genotype would be expected on average to be approximately 1g where g is the total number of host genotypes in the population under these conditions r0 for large populations is approximately bg this result suggests that experimentally doubling the number of host genotypes in the population would reduce r0 by one half and that this would be roughly true even if the experiment increased the total number of hosts in the population assuming the population is already large the analytical results also suggest that the parasite would die out following the addition of genetic diversity to the host population provided that the frequency of each host genotype declines to less than 1bwe used computer simulations to examine the gist of these ideas the simulations assumed a haploid host with two loci coding for resistance each locus could have up to three alleles for a total of nine different genotypes each of the host genotypes could be infected by one of nine different parasite genotypes consistent with the matching-alleles model for infection in these simulations birth rates of the host were density dependent and infection reduced the intrinsic birth rate by 30 the parameters where chosen for illustrative purposes the details of the simulation are given in lively 2010bwe began the simulation with two alleles at one locus and three alleles at the other locus giving six possible host genotypes an uninfected host population was initiated at carrying capacity k40 000 where the number of hosts of each genotype was determined by randomly assigning allele frequencies at the two loci at generation 1 one host of each genotype was introduced as infected thereafter the infected hosts of each genotype were introduced into the population with a probability of 002 per generation to simulate immigration of infected individuals we started by assuming b9 meaning each infection produced nine propagules that contacted a host from the analytical results we would expect under that the average value for r0 would be bg9615 where g is the number of genotypes as such the pathogen would be expected to spread in the population as was indeed the case figure 1a after an initial oscillatory period the gene frequency dynamics stabilized figure 1a and the prevalence of infection also stabilized for the parameter values considered here figure 1b r0 converged on the predicted value of 15 figure 1cwe then introduced a third allele at the second locus at generation 100 which increased the number of possible genotypes from six to nine the allele quickly spread as it conferred resistance on three of the nine possible genotypes for which there was no matching parasite genotype figure 1a average r0 quickly dropped to below 1 as the allele spread in the population figure 1c and the frequency of infection declined sharply figure 1b matching parasite genotypes were introduced into the population by migration at a rate of 002 per genotype per generation which lead to selection against the new allele after it became common as well as to a slight increase in r0 figure 1c this resulted in sufficient selection to equalize allele frequencies so that the frequency of each genotype approximated 1g at this point r0 was equal to one bg991 and parasite prevalence fell close to zero but was maintained at a low level by immigration figure 1bthe point is that introducing a single novel allele in the host population increased the number of possible genotypes by 50 this lead to virtual elimination of the parasite as the prevalence of infection plummeted from about 60 to near zero a reduction in prevalence occurred despite the fact that matching parasite genotypes were also introduced into the population and that the host population size remained large that is close to 40 000 individuals results not shown clearly under the assumptions of the present model small increases in allelic diversity can cause dramatic reductions in parasitism even in very large host populations in addition elimination of the pathogen is not necessarily followed by a loss of genetic diversity in the host population as the different host genotypes are selectively neutral in the absence of parasite pressure figure 1athe available data and the model are consistent with the idea that genetic diversity in host populations can reduce the spread of disease however a practical question arises would the beneficial effect of adding hosts with novel genotypes in order to increase local genetic diversity outweigh the positive effect of increasing population size on r0 a possible answer is also suggested by the model which suggests that the effect of increasing population size on r0 shows diminishing returns with host density such that r0 is asymptotic on bg figure 2 as such while increasing host population size does strongly affect r0 in small host populations it has a small effect in large host populations figure 2 this suggests that increasing genetic diversity can still reduce parasite prevalence even though host population size is also increased the results in figure 2 suggest that boosting genetic diversity could overcome the effect of increasing host population size even when the latter is increased by fourfoldcritically the diversity threshold does not work by simply reducing the population size of the individual genotypes the threshold in fact was calculated by assuming an infinite host population size rather it works by reducing the probability of successful infection by reducing the frequency of matching host genotypes for each parasite genotypeconsistent with results from agricultural populations the existing literature suggests that high genetic diversity could buffer host populations against disease spread although observational studies from natural populations of vertebrates for example cheetahs sea lions fish and frogs may have limitations they strongly suggest that diversity matters and their results are consistent with experimental studies on freshwater crustaceans and social insects however several questions remain
does a diversity threshold exist in other words can parasites be eliminated by increasing host genetic diversity above some threshold valuewhat are the relative effects of host density and host genetic diversity on disease spreadwhat are the effects of genetic diversity in the parasite population versus that of the host populationwhat is the heritability of parasite resistance in natural populations very little is known about the heritability for resistance in natural populations it should be high in populations where genetic diversity is maintained by parasite-mediated frequency-dependent selectionthese issues would be best addressed by data from natural populations if parasites take hold or die out depending on how much host genetic diversity exists relative to the threshold determining whether diversity thresholds exist in natural populations may have great value this may be particularly helpful for conserving endangered species and mediating vectorhumanparasite transmissionthere were no data to depositthe world is experiencing the expansive spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in a global pandemic that was first reported on december 31 2019 in wuhan china what began as cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology was identified as a novel coronavirus on january 7 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the illness that comes from sars-cov-2 was named a pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 1 by that time it had ravaged much of china the epidemic is accelerating the time from the first reported case to the first 100000 cases was 67 days it took 11 days for the next 100000 cases 4 days for the following 100000 cases and 3 days for the subsequent 100000 cases as of march 31 2020 there are 858669 cases and 42151 deaths in the world attributed directly to covid-19 188530 cases and 3889 deaths in the united states a 503 and 685 increase respectively in 2 days we should remember that 1 month ago on march 1 there were only 30 cases in the united states 2 every region of the globe is currently impacted by covid-19 3the enormous strain this pandemic is placing on health care systems across the world is palpable from testing capacity to supply chains for personal protective equipment ppe specimen collection swabs and supplies and equipment including ventilators for those requiring hospital care new approaches are needed to scale up testing for covid-19 to reduce the needs for ppe and specimen collection swabs and to allow testing for sars-cov2 outside of health care facilitiesnew cases of covid-19 infection and casualties continue to multiply and mixed messages abound as the public health world has urgently recommended covid-19 prevention measures they are being questioned as being too vast hard to follow invasive to our lifestyle and damaging to the economy public health experts have either been sidelined in the covid-19 response decisions or have found themselves at odds with much of the information being presented by political leadership in the united states the country currently with the largest number of covid-19 cases president trump extended the initial 15-day national slow down and called for social distancing until april 30 2020 in an attempt to reduce the spread of the virus 45 states like california illinois and new york have implemented state-wide stay-at-home ordinances while other states have implemented less restrictive measures or no statewide measures at all 6-8 determining the proper scale and timing of these measures is critical to controlling the spread of covid-19 and the numbers of lives lost we believe that the best public health evidence must inform activities in three priority areas to stop this pandemic 1 coordinated and consistent stay-at-home orders across multiple jurisdictions including potential nationwide mandates 2 rapid scale-up of sars-cov-2 testing and 3 improved health care capacity to respondthere is public health consensus that limiting the number of contacts between persons can slow covid-19 transmission in a community and give time for health care systems to respond the most substantial of these approaches is a government order to stay at home except for food and medical needs although there are now multiple theoretical and practical models about how stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions could slow covid-19 transmission it is clear from all of them that consistency in implementation and communication is key these policies will only be effective if they are implemented in a coordinated manner across large geographic regions where people commonly move but there remain multiple examples of these public health interventions not being uniformly implemented for instance our city atlanta georgia quickly implemented several local variations of stay-at-home recommendations from multiple city and county levels that comprise our metropolitan area yet the state-wide recommendation was only implemented several weeks later this meant that people who are told not to come to work in one atlanta county had no such order where they lived and continued to congregate in public places this patchwork response is not unique to the united states and illustrates an underlying lack of understanding about how to use these public health measures to slow the transmission of infectious diseasesthis inconsistency in implementing public health measures has also created substantial amounts of public confusion and fodder for social media conspiracy theories hyperpartisanship and distrust of experts covid-19 is the first true global pandemic of the social media era offering new opportunities for rapid distribution of accurate public health information to millions of people unfortunately these critical public health communications about actions to take to protect oneself from covid-19 are not easy to differentiate from inaccurate or even dangerously wrong information having correct information that is well reasoned and delivered through consistent messaging are all pillars of behavior change including changing peoples transmission-related behaviors in response to covid-19 9 social media is now one of the most predominant ways that people get information and public health must find better ways to communicate about mitigation plans through these forumsdecisions about covid-19 mitigation policies must be informed by the best epidemiologic information which requires rapid scale-up of covid-19 testing this will require rapid development of new diagnostic tests laboratory capacity testing supply chains and health care personnel to collect the specimens novel testing strategies under development including the use of rapid diagnostic tests serological tests and self-collected specimens will improve our ability to screen a large number of people quickly and give us a new understanding of the extent of exposure disease and recovery this information will be vital to epidemiologic modeling to support information-driven decision making on the appropriate timing and scope of the response there are also a rapidly growing number of examples of innovative approaches to implementing covid-19 testing including some examples of successful large-scale screening programs like drive-up testing in south korea where thousands of tests were delivered each day 10changing the course of covid-19 disease in heavily impacted countries such as the united states will require a massive scale-up of testing compared to what has been conducted to date for instance in the united states the rate of total covid-19 testing up to this point is just under 3000 tests per 1 million people or 964865 overall since january 10 2020 11 that has been an admittedly dismal response to testing with a focus mainly on those who are most severely ill this rate of testing does not meet the needs of the health care sector response much less the needs to better understand covid-19 epidemiology in a way that will make control measures most effective we should be testing at least 1 million us residents every week 03 of the population during this phase of the pandemic additionally there is a need for shorter time from test to results to better guide care and isolation decisions and we must find new ways of reaching more people with testing without overburdening our already taxed health care systemsthe control of movement and scale-up of covid-19 testing will only be successful in truncating the covid-19 pandemic and reducing lives lost if there is an immediate commitment of resources to improve the capacity of the health care sector to respond reports from multiple countries already impacted by covid-19 predict that health care capacity will be rapidly exceeded as transmission grows under the current predictions of covid-19 transmission the ability of the health care sector to respond will certainly require coordination of efforts to increase the capacity of hospital beds ventilators protective equipment and the clinicians who use themprotecting the health and safety of health care workers is vital to the health of each of us and to the workings of our health care system there needs to be a high level of commitment to the safety of health care professionals by providing them with the tools to prevent nosocomial covid-19 infections although this implicitly means making sure all health care workers have appropriate ppes this can also come in the form of telemedicine and other virtual care trends such has chatbots that capitalize on advances in technology to provide care for patients outside of a hospital setting until the time hospitalization is needed this form of care protects our health care workforce and maximizes the scope of care that can be provided with less impact on the hospital settingour global public health response to covid-19 will only be successful if we rapidly generate the best data to inform decisions from our political leaders regarding resources and policies to slow transmission and improve our response this is an unprecedented global public health crisis that will require not only strong political commitment and courage but also innovation on a capacity and timing scale that was inconceivable 3 months ago what we do right now and how quickly we do it will directly change how long covid-19 is with us and how many people will die it is critical that science-based information guide our public health strategies and that leaders listen to our best informationmuch of public health is about making changes to improve human life but without much announcement it is impossible to determine the number of lives saved due to epidemiologic research yet it is unquestionable that our discipline has saved millions of lives through the implementation of interventions and preventative programs our training to understand and use data to protect our communities has not been needed more it is also our responsibility to use our skills wisely and in a steadfast way that does not bend to the whim of politics but instead affirms what we know loudly if needed and highlights what we still need to determine as quickly and accurately as possible to protect our worldpandemic is defined as an epidemic occurring worldwide or over a very wide area that crosses international borders and affects a great number of people 1 according to the world health organization who a pandemic is considered to have begun once a disease not encountered before in a population emerges and once the agent of the disease spreads easily and constantly among people and causes a virulent disease 2 the fact that a disease is prevalent and leads to the loss of a large number of people does not make it sufficient to be defined as a pandemic it should also be transmissible 2 a pandemic increases morbidity and mortality in a very large geographic area and provokes social and political deterioration it has a vital position throughout human history and in the development of civilizations due to profound socioeconomic problems caused by pandemics they have resulted in changes in the agenda of countries and put forward issues most particularly sanitation rules that people should pay attention to while coexisting throughout history there have been many epidemics like variola and tuberculosis one of the most destructive pandemics was the plague that killed an estimated 75200 million people in the 14th century considering that the world population was approximately 475 million in that century the fatal effect of the pandemic can be comprehended more easily 3 the plague had begun in china and central asia and spread to the whole world the transmission of plague to europe became possible by the chinese merchandise sold to europe by asian traders 4 it is known that the fleas and mice on the ship were effective in the spread of the disease in the meantime crimean tatars had invaded genoese harbor and thrown their dead bodies carrying the plague using catapults into the city and transmitted the disease to the italians 4 the first italian cities to encounter the plague were genoa messina and venice afterwards the plague arrived to paris in 1348 and affected london in 1349 and after having penetrated into scotland and scandinavia it reached to its origin the land of the tatars it caused death of one-thirds of people living in europe shortly after the spread of the pandemic people experienced psychological destruction nonetheless the aftermath of the plague saw a rise in the lack of confidence towards administrations cutback in social activities and communication and led people to distance themselves from one another and caused an increase in product and labor an economic collapse was seen in the world mainly in europe that had just started to recover from famine 4 millions of people were killed due to cholera pandemic in the 19th century 5 there were four influenza pandemics in the 20th and 21st centuries in 1918 the spanish flu led to the death of 2050 million people worldwide world population was approximately 18 billion during that time and estimated case-fatality rate was determined as 23 6 the 195758 pandemic known as the asian flu resulted in the death of 14 million people worldwide and the 1968-69 pandemic referred to as the hong kong flu caused the death of 14 million people worldwide estimated case-fatality rate of the 20092010 influenza a h1n1 pandemic was established as 002 the age group the pandemic affected the most was children and young adults it resulted in the death of 100400 thousand people worldwide 6 last year around the end of 2019 a novel coronavirus pneumonia case group was identified in the wuhan city of the province of hubei in china rapidly spreading around the country an epidemic arose and increasing number of cases started to be seen in other countries in february 2020 the world health organization defined covid-19 which meant 2019 coronavirus disease the virus causing covid-19 was referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 an interim guideline was published by the world health organization and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 78 covid-19 was announced as a pandemic by the world health organization in 11 march 2020 and the pandemic is still continuing during a pandemic steps include controlling and surveilling the outbreak finding the center bringing the source under control preventing human-to-human transmission ensuring social distancing and determining vaccination and treatment agents 9 in a model based on the 1918 flu pandemic analysis it is assumed that one-third of the transmissions occurred in houses one-third occurred in schools and workplaces and the other one-third among the general public in the united states of america thus an important control strategy would target the closing of schools and workplaces 10 it should be seriously questioned whether hospitals would have the extreme capacity to treat a large number of patients or not if not at sufficient capacity necessary planning should be made by local supporters and public health officials in order to meet the deficit other measures include planning healthcare services in alternative settings other than hospitals taking necessary infection control measures and drawing up clear guidelines in favor of public health for patient consent 11 it is necessary to form appropriate infrastructure and credible communication systems to coordinate public health intervention and plan and appoint leaders at national and local levels 12 the world health organization who recommends countries to make their own pandemic risk evaluations since incidence of human and animal cases in different countries in the world and the procedures to be done thereafter would differ who updated its pandemic influenza risk management guideline in 2017 this guideline can be used to inform and conform national and international pandemic preparations and interventions countries should review andor update their national flu preparation and intervention plans in order to reflect the approach taken in this guideline moreover roles and responsibilities of who regarding pandemic preparations were also stated in terms of supporting member countries in line with the crisis and risk management policies this guideline does not intend to replace national plans that should be developed by each country national pandemic influenza risk evaluation aims at determining the probability and outcomes of events affecting public health at a global national and local level it constitutes the basis to act against and decrease the negative consequences of public health risks 13 it is attempted to make predictions with statistical models on when the agent would penetrate into the country or cities in the event of a pandemic 14 pandemic influenza phases reflect risk assessment of the global status concerning each and every influenza virus with a potential to be pandemic and to infect people initially these assessments are carried out when these types of viruses are defined and afterwards updated according to virologic epidemiologic and clinical data obtained global phase represents the spread of the novel flu subtype to the world taking the disease it causes into consideration and separating it into interpandemic alarm pandemic and transition phases global phases are used by who to convey global status pandemic phase is the period of global spreading transitions between interpandemic alarm and pandemic phases can be rapid and gradual 13 as pandemic viruses emerge countries and regions face different risks at different times therefore it is strongly recommended for countries to develop their own national risk assessments by considering information provided by who hence decisions for national risk management of any country are expected to be based on local risk assessments but also to be informed by global risk assessments 13 who should be able to follow the development process of the pandemic and guide countries with appropriate methods like strengthened surveillance and active monitorization who should make suggestions in medical and nonmedical issues for this purpose who should announce data independently and in a transparent manner thus who requires accurate and rapid data flow from every government in order to fulfill its obligation 15 united nations un on the other hand is a much larger system un aids in countries to adapt themselves to necessary arrangements strengthening technical capacities of the countries during pandemics through the peacekeeping commission united nations development program and united nations childrens fund 16 risk assessment regarding pandemic influenza includes defining influenza viruses reviewing significant virologic and clinical information on each and every influenza virus and classifying these as regards pandemic potency and probable outcomes evaluation of exposure aims at identifying exposure to an upsetting flu virus individual groups with a probability to become ill and defining the sensitivity of these groups in terms of immunity and disease severity this process contains epidemiologic and sensitivity factors such as travel history incubation period and estimated transmission potential following risk and exposure assessments these two assessments are finalized with a content evaluation content evaluation is the assessment of the setting the event has taken or is taking place content evaluation includes social technological scientific economic ethical and political factors exposure and content evaluations are made and risk is characterized risk characterization seeks to regulate the probability and impact of every risk risk characterization uses these evaluations in order to assess if a specific flu virus has the potential to become pandemic and to what extent the society will be affected by such event and thus to judge the urgency and scope of risk management activities risk assessment is a constant process during risk management continuity for the evaluation of pandemic severity to be beneficial it should be performed when public health decisions are required 13to that end surplus information should be provided in order to answer all critical questions regarding the pandemic that has emerged questions on new cases and their progression and those regarding the type of diseases and complications encountered which group of patients would be severely ill and die ie age groups and groups at risk for severe outcomes whether or not the virus is susceptible to antiviral agents the number of people that would become ill and the impact of the cases on the use of healthcare services and workforce should be answered these questions will be of help in directing decisions on vaccination production and utilization strategy antiviral use mobilization of healthcare sources school closings and social distancing strategies data responding to each critical question will be addressed in the context of three indicators each of these indicators will contain information obtained from various data types including virologic epidemiologic and clinical data data will be grouped so that they would be more accessible and comprehensible by the public and policy-makers national action plans have been charted according to six categories of principal components of emergency risk management for health these include policy and resource management planning and coordination information and information management health infrastructure and logistics healthcare and related services and community emergency situation risk management capacities 13 research projects their budget and the number of researchers to work on these projects should also be carefully constructed cooperation with the government for these plans is crucial 17 pandemics require globally compatible actions pandemics are extremely destructive events that can cause serious social economic and political stress preparation demands the approach of all communities in order to enable the world to respond quickly and effectively to decrease morbidity and mortality in the next pandemic not only the healthcare sector but also all other sectors individuals families and communities play a role in lightening the effects of a pandemic nonpharmaceutical interventions can be the only effective measure in many countries during the onset of a pandemic there would probably be no pandemic vaccination that would be effective against the novel virus non-pharmaceutical interventions in the early stage of the pandemic should be implemented in order to slow down transmission and decrease its effect these interventions include social distancing staying home when ill coughing etiquette covering the mouth with a handkerchief while coughing or sneezing and hygiene rules such as washing the hands and cleaning the surfaces and objects touched extreme measures can be taken and implemented during severe pandemics including patients wearing masks surgical masks school closings and diminishing contact between people nonpharmaceutical interventions will help decrease the number of people exposed to and afterwards infected by the virus 6 since pandemics necessitate an approach for the whole community individuals and communities should be cared about listened to and relieved of anxieties people should be informed on how to protect themselves and stop the spreading of the virus 18 at the present time airports harbors and ports road transportation and entry points to the country may have a critical role in the international transmission the diseases via persons goods and vehicles therefore countries should be ready to detect and respond to any healthcare event that would cause international concern by bringing healthcare-based restrictions in international travel and trade thus developing necessary public health capacities in entry points of the country will limit the spread of public health hazards 6 particularly frequent travelers may have a part in accelerating the international spread of the virus during the early period of the pandemic hence in the event of the onset of the pandemic being at a countryside where international travel is scarce the transmission of the agent to frequent travelers will be much late and the spread of the pandemic will be much slower 19 international health regulations 2005 try to limit public health measures preventing unnecessary intervention to international travel and trade in order to reach this goal who regularly makes recommendations on trade and travel measures regarding public health events along with not interfering with measures related to specific trade and travel international health regulations 2005 mandate countries to inform who on the justifications of the time of interventions and important measures taken by the administration of the countries this is defined as the cause of a more than 24-h delay in the movement of international passengers luggage cargos containers vehicles and items by the international health regulations 2005 apart from providing information to countries on these measures who may demand from the implementing country to reevaluate these applications 13 world health organization continues to make recommendations against travel and trade restrictions for countries fighting with the covid-19 pandemic travel measures interfering significantly with international traffic can only be justified at the onset of a pandemic since countries may be allowed to rapidly implement preliminary measures even for a few days these kinds of restrictions should be based on meticulous risk assessment be proportional to public health risk not last long and be reevaluated regularly as the event advances travel ban to affected regions or rejection of entry of passengers traveling from affected regions is not effective in preventing case imports but may have important economic and social impact temperature scan at entry and exit points is not an efficient way to stop international spread since infected people may be within the incubation period and not show early symptoms during the disease for an adequate risk assessment and a follow of a probable case the patients should be provided with disease-preventing messages health statements should be collected upon entry and contact information of the passengers should be obtained which would be much more efficient 18 it is necessary to delay or prevent travel to affected regions for elderly patients and for those with underlying chronic diseases personal hygiene coughing etiquette and putting an at least one-meter distance between yourself and those showing symptoms are important for all passengers frequent hand hygiene after contact with particularly respiratory fluids is mandatory hand hygiene includes washing the hand with soap and water or cleaning the hand with alcohol-based liquids the mouth and nose of the person coughing or sneezing should be closed with a handkerchief or using the inner part of the elbow touching the mouth and nose should be avoided 18 unless a person shows symptoms she does not need to wear a medical mask since there is no evidence on any kind of masks protecting the noninfected person from the virus besides masks can be commonly worn in some cultures it is important to follow the best practice on how to wear remove and dispose of the mask and ensure hand hygiene if medical masks are to be worn 18 passengers returning from the affected regions should monitor the symptoms for 14 days on their own and also follow the national protocols of the receiving countries some countries may demand the returning passengers to be put in quarantine should symptoms such as fever cough and difficulty in breathing manifest it is recommended to the passengers to contact local healthcare providers preferably over the phone and inform them of their symptoms and travel history 18 it is suggested to follow the recommendations of who for designated passengers in entry points the management of ill passengers in the context of present covid-19 disease pandemic in international airports harbors and motorwayroad gates should include measures to be implemented according to the priorities and capacities of each country in order to detect ill passengers and determine the symptoms of covid-19 disease and the possibility of virus exposure interviewing with ill passengers reporting cases with suspected covid-19 infection isolation of those with suspected covid-19 infection and initial case management and referral are necessary 20 airport operators aircraftairplane operators airline and airport crew and ground personnel should be informed on how to recognize covid-19 signs and symptoms crew and ground personnel should be informed on and frequently reminded of measures preventing the spread of covid-19 including social distancing hand hygiene respiratory etiquette environmental cleaning waste disposal when and how to wear masks and avoiding contact with people showing respiratory symptoms medical face mask should be reserved for individuals with respiratory symptoms to prevent contamination with others the personnel should be trained for hand hygiene and how to wear and remove protective equipment personnel in close contact with symptomatic individuals should wear medical mask eye protection face shield or goggles gloves and gown 21 a number of factors should be taken into account to prevent the spread of covid-19 for countries that have decided to bring back citizens from affected regions these include scanning right before flight risk communication with the passengers and crew infection control resources for the flightjourney preparation of the crew for a possible infected passenger entry scan upon arrival and close-monitoring for 14 days after arrival 18 countries should intensify surveillance for severe pneumonia and uncommon flu-like disease pandemics and attentively monitor the development of covid-19 pandemics by strengthening epidemiologic surveillance countries should continue raising awareness in the public opinion healthcare specialists and policy-makers through effective risk communication regarding covid-19 and should refrain from actions of stigmatization and discrimination countries should share all related information on covid-19 for its timely evaluation and management as necessitated by the international health regulations 2005 18 countries implementing additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic need to share related scientific data for the implementation of these measures and public health justification with who within the first 48 h after the implementation who will share this information with other countries significant intervention generally means a more than 24-h delay in or rejection of international passengers luggage cargos containers vehicles goods and similar items 18 airline travel has the most important role in spreading pandemics in a study considering airline network in the prediction of the spread of pandemics rate and density of transmission have been detected with high accuracy 22 therefore making predictions in early periods of pandemics using these modellings can be effective in rapidly taking necessary measures 23 if a country decides to quarantine arriving passengers who do not show symptoms some factors should be taken into consideration there is no universal guideline regarding the infrastructure of the quarantine facility however an area that will not increase the potential contamination and those put in quarantine should be recorded to be followed in the event of potential disease accommodation and supplies sufficient food and water to passengers sleep arrangements and clothing protection of luggage and other items appropriate medical treatment necessary communication devices should be adequately provided for in a language they can understand medical mask is not required for those put in quarantine if masks are used the best practice should be followed quarantine period which lasts 14 days according to the currently known incubation period of the virus can be extended due to delayed exposure 24 social and economic life continues during pandemics a pandemic has the potential to affect all sectors in the event of declaration of disaster as regards the severity of the pandemic there is legislation oriented at covering fiscal charges however regulation should be made for pandemics that do not necessitate declaration of disaster in order to meet unexpectedunanticipated needs and additional financial needs should be met during a rapidly spreading pandemic vital setbacks can be seen in the transfer of goods and services the need for social support programs due to economic problems arising from the shutdown of businesses and interim unemployment 25 it is predicted that covid-19 pandemic will cost the world economy as much as an approximate 1 trillion dollars which is a much deeper and worse global crisis compared to that of 2007-2008 institutions like the un are run with the aid of developed countries in particular it is feared that a serious crisis will be felt in un resources as part of the effect of this pandemic and lead to weakness in the function of the un 26 pandemic diseases may result in acute short-term fiscal shocks and long-term damage in economic growth early period public health efforts such as monitoring contact implementing quarantine isolating contagious cases in order to cover or limit pandemics require significant human resources and personnel cost as a pandemic expands new facilities may be needed to be constructed to manage additional contagious cases and health system expenses will tremendously increase as a result of demand in medical supplies personal protective equipment and medicine decreasing tax revenue may deepen the fiscal stress caused by increasing expenses in low- and middle-income countries that have weak tax systems and severe fiscal restrictions this dynamic was seen in the western africa ebola pandemic in liberia in 2014 as costs increased economic activity slowed down and quarantines and curfews decreased the governments capacity to collect revenues during a mild-to-moderate pandemic high income countries that are not affected can balance fiscal crises in low income countries by providing official recovery support including direct budget support meanwhile high income countries may be faced with the same fiscal stresses and be unwilling to provide help during a severe pandemic low- and middle-income countries may cut back in government expenses negative economic crises are derived from workforce reduction due to disease and deaths and behavior change out of fear fear manifests itself with many behavioral changes the analysis of the economic effects of the 2014 western africa ebola pandemic has shown decrease in workforce shutdown in businesses delay in transportation closing of land borders by some governments restrictions implemented on citizens arriving from affected regions in entry to the country cancellation of commercial flights decrease in shipment and prevention in travel and trade these effects decrease the participation of the pandemic to workforce and constrict local and regional trade preventive behavior such as prevention of travel restaurant and public spaces and workplace discontinuity as prophylactics also has economic outcomes during a severe pandemic all sectors of the economy agriculture manufacture services encounter shortages rapid price elevation is basic necessities deterioration that causes economic stress for the household private firms and governments a severe pandemic may result in a significant and permanent economic damage 27 in order to take a pandemic under control coordination should be established flow of information should be regulated necessary health interventions case management algorithms vector control should be determined health systems hospitals healthcare personnel medicine should be strengthened the society should be informed and the community should be included in pandemic surveillance and controlalessandro vespignani although there are inherent limitations to predictions in complex socio-technical systems in recent years mathematical and computational models have successfully forecasted the size of epidemics and have been used to communicate the risks of uncurbed infectious disease outbreaks mathematical and computational models are ideal as forecasting tools and can also provide situational awareness when we lack good data or define counterfactual scenarios that help disentangle the impact of pharmaceutical interventions and public health policiespeculiar to the field of computational epidemiology is the distinction between two different kinds of work peace time research when there are no health emergencies or threats and what we call war time when there are emergencies like the covid-19 epidemic during war time we have to work with limited data a constantly changing landscape and a lot of assumptions the work must often be tactical and what has been produced the day before often must be completely revised the day after because a new piece of information has arrived at the same time the challenges faced during infectious disease threats set the questions and problems for the rigorous and foundational research that allows the field to advance after the emergency is gonehuaiyu tian and christopher dye as the covid-19 epidemic spread across china from wuhan city in early 2020 it was vital to find out how to slow or stop it we could not investigate the effectiveness of control measures in a controlled experiment or a clinical trial and instead had to rely on statistical and mathematical modelling however precise evaluation of particular interventions requires substantial data or assumptions not only accurate characterization of the epidemic process itself but also government actions and even human behaviours such as the three billion trips taken over the chinese new year holiday we therefore constructed models in conjunction with a growing geocoded database on coronavirus epidemiology human movement and public health interventionswe took two approaches to the analysis the first exploited natural variation in the distribution of covid-19 cases and in the type and timing of interventions on the basis of statistical tests of association carried out with general linear models we found that the unprecedented wuhan city travel ban affecting 11 million people slowed the dispersal of infection to other cities by 3 days1 delaying epidemic growth elsewhere in china we found too that chinese cities that pre-emptively implemented control measures  such as suspending intra-city public transport closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings  reported in the first week of their outbreaks one-third fewer cases than cities that started control later our second approach to analysis built these findings into a dynamic mathematical model from which we calculated that chinas national emergency response prevented hundreds of thousands of cases that we otherwise expected to see during the first 50 days of the epidemicjames o lloyd-smith as with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers before it the epidemiology of covid-19 has been punctuated by conspicuous superspreading events in which an infected person transmits the virus to many more people than average the average transmissibility of a pathogen is quantified by its basic reproduction number r0 which is a bedrock concept in infectious disease dynamics yet biological social and environmental factors  aided by a good dose of happenstance  give rise to significant individual variation around this average this holds true for all pathogens to varying degrees but evidence suggests that the emerging coronaviruses causing sars mers and covid-19 are systematically prone to superspreading23why do we care mathematically for a given r0 a pathogen with more superspreaders must also have more infected individuals who do not contribute to onward spread such individual variation makes transmission chains more likely to die out and outbreaks rarer but more explosive than if every case was an average transmitter2 this variation matters most when case numbers are small early in the pandemic or after successful outbreak suppression if the population remains susceptible as countries try to prevent establishment of community transmission health officials must guard against complacency recognizing that many importations will fade out by chance but a minority will ignite outbreaks that expand with shocking speedphysicists can help by working to learn the causes of superspreading events many involve alternative modes of spread such as airborne transmission but inferring such mechanisms from imperfect data in complex environments raises many technical challenges there are also unsolved mathematical and statistical problems in untangling the influences of individual biological variation and dynamic social contact networks that govern transmission opportunities by understanding these causes we can better target interventions to decelerate the spread of covid-19rosalind m eggo sars-cov-2 is a new pathogen with some key characteristics that many mathematical modellers were concerned could emerge together quite high mortality and efficient transmission between people as the virus has made its way around the world transmission models are proving invaluable to the response effort some models aim to provide answers that public health decision-makers need in real time how effective possible interventions are likely to be our group recently modelled a classical intervention against infectious diseases contact tracing and isolation4 in which the contacts of known cases are found and if they show symptoms are isolated quickly doing so therefore decreases the average number of new infections that each infected person creates a quantity modellers call the reproduction number by developing a model for this system we were able to determine what fraction of a cases contacts must be found and isolated to control a new outbreak based on the best-possible information on transmission and disease available at that time however for some parameters such as for how much transmission occurs before the onset of symptoms there was little information for these parameters we provided scenarios of a range of values so that decision-makers could see the effect under different regimes and so that if that information became available in the future the model would still be informativemunik shrestha and samuel v scarpino while firefighters in australia were bringing the devastating 20192020 bushfires under control a novel coronavirus was spreading rapidly through china transitioning from a local outbreak into a global pandemic remarkably the mathematical models scientists use to study the spreading of both fires and pathogens share many features an important similarity is that in both cases models and data show that the economic and health costs do not increase linearly with the number of people infected or hectares burned instead they explode going from imperceptibly small to unimaginably large in what seems an instant herein lies the central challenge of studying such systems both involve random multiplicative processes characterized by exponential growth and discontinuous phase transitions where the equilibrium number of cases can go from nearly zero to infinitely many in actually an instant accordingly their mathematical properties depend on rare exponentially costly and hard-to-study eventshowever there is at least one crucial difference between fires and epidemics how readily the two systems can be monitored and measured whereas the effects of fires can often be seen with the naked eye public health records contain information on only the largest outbreaks as a result although ecologists can study the past effects of numerous fires both large and small epidemiologists rely primarily on data from rare population-spanning events why does this matter at the phase transition between local outbreak and global pandemic the proportion infected can be scale free meaning measuring only the large outbreaks leads to immeasurably large bias mathematical epidemiologists have developed models that can inform policy that saves lives but the need remains for more refined instruments to gather empirical observations and test those modelsbernardo gutierrez and moritz u g kraemer making accurate assessments about the spread of infectious diseases relies on the availability of robust epidemiological data a scarce commodity during growing epidemics and when resources are scarce official statistics are usually presented as aggregated data for instance newly reported confirmed cases by day and tend to be shared on a limited basis restricting access to the data by the scientific community at large although such information is important in tracking outbreaks it does not include the tremendous detail of epidemiological information that is available across different platforms such as news outlets social media and official government health reports furthermore epidemiological reporting standards vary considerably across these platforms and contain varying degrees of detail making automated data collection challengingas an alternative approach on the basis of experiences from past outbreaks the open covid-19 data working group opted for a crowdsourcing approach an international team of volunteers curate data sources by hand and compile the data in a standardized format this format presents epidemiological data at an individual case level which allows the extraction of remarkably detailed information on case demographics travel histories and high-resolution geographical distributions5 more importantly the constant screening of various information sources in real time adds value to this approach and makes it an important tool for disease surveillance a key aspect to guarantee its utility is the focus on data sharing through google sheets and the software development platform githubdata are openly accessible and updated daily6 and can be viewed herejoseph wu kathy leung and gabriel m leung rapid and reliable assessment of the clinical severity of pandemic pathogens such as sars-cov-2 the virus that causes covid-19 is a top priority in pandemic response in particular characterization of the infectionfatality risk the probability of dying among infected individuals and symptomatic casefatality risk the probability of dying among those who develop symptoms relies on accurate estimates of the true epidemic size reported case counts are inevitably biased by the proportion of infections that are symptomatic care-seeking behaviour and the availability of tests although these biases could be partially addressed by developing transmission models to analyse all available epidemiological and clinical data a synergistic and complementary solution is to use seroepidemiological studies these use measurements of antibody response across a population to infer infective exposure to and by extension immunity against the pandemic pathogen and provide the most direct and reliable data for estimating true epidemic size integrating seroepidemiological data into transmission models can greatly reduce the uncertainty in the parameter estimates of clinical severity and transmission dynamics at the time of writing serological tests for covid-19 are being developed and validated long-term longitudinal serological follow-up of recovered individuals is crucial for characterizing the underlying immunodynamics for instance it can reveal the strength and duration of protective immunity and thus the probability of reinfection as such large-scale serosurveys should be conducted regularly and prospectively planned over the course of the different waves of the pandemic and beyond to provide serological data from different age groupsa highly contagious atypical pneumonia first appeared in the guangdong province peoples republic of china in november 2002 this was not widely publicized and the condition remained isolated to china for the next 3 months on february 21 2003 a chinese physician from the guangdong province patient a in figure 1

it is important to understand the meaning of close contact it is defined as having cared for or lived with a person known to have sars or unprotected contact with body secretions from such a person this includes kissing embracing sharing utensils or bedding performing a physical examination or other direct physical contact between persons it does not include sitting across a waiting room for a brief period walking by a person with sars or other casual contactchest radiographs of patients with sars show patchy focal infiltrates or consolidation often with a peripheral distribution which may progress to diffuse infiltrates pleural effusions have not been reported early findings may be subtle and initial findings on chest radiographs may be normal in up to 25 of patients6 computed tomography ct may be more sensitive than plain films highresolution ct scans have shown abnormalities in patients with suspected sars who have normal findings on plain films10 the characteristic ct finding is bilateral peripheral airspaceground-glass consolidation mimicking that seen in bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonialaboratory findings in patients with sars include thrombocytopenia and leukopenia in particular lymphopenia elevated creatine kinase lactate dehydrogenase and transaminase levels have been noted a high peak lactate dehydrogenase level and an initial elevated white blood cell count may carry a poor prognosis7
the etiologic link of a coronavirus with the sars epidemic was established by peiris et al11 in hong kong several diagnostic laboratory methods were used to initially recover and then characterize coronavirus infection in various specimens obtained from patients with sars these included inoculation and recovery of the virus in cell cultures characterization of morphologic features by electron microscopy serologic antibody determination and molecular amplification and sequencing of the target rna of the agent overall 45 of the 50 patients these investigators studied had 1 or more laboratory tests serology 32 rt-pcr 22 culture 2 that supported a coronavirus etiology the results of this initial report were quickly confirmed and expanded by collaborative studies in several major public health centers and medical institutions throughout the world coordinated by the world health organization12 13 molecular sequencing analyses have indicated that the virus is only distantly related to previously sequenced coronaviruses based on serologic studies it appears that this virus has not previously circulated in humans and is now referred to as sars-cov14 15
coronaviruses are enveloped rna viruses that cause disease in humans and animals the previously known human coronaviruses are a major cause of the common cold and can occasionally cause pneumonia research teams in hong kong and shenzhen china recently detected several coronaviruses closely related genetically to the sars-cov in 2 animal species masked palm civet and raccoon-dog and antibodies against the sars-cov in 1 additional species chinese ferret badger these and other wild animals are traditionally considered delicacies and are sold for human consumption in markets throughout southern chinathis study provides the first indication that the sars-cov exists outside a human host studies are needed to determine how widespread the sars virus might be in animals in guangdong and elsewhere and if these animals can excrete the virus in an amount sufficient to infect humans and through what route such transmission occursthe sars-cov appears to be transmitted primarily by large droplet spread although surface contamination and possibly airborne spread may play a role recent data suggest that the virus may remain viable for considerable periods on a dry surface up to 24 hours hence transmission through fomites may occur the outbreak in an apartment complex in hong kong that accounted for more than 300 cases has been attributed to fecal spread a patient with sars who had diarrhea stayed with his brother in this building it is thought that infection spread from him to other residents in the building through a leaking sewage drain which allowed aerosolization of virus-containing material sewage also backed into bathroom floor drains in some apartments and may have accounted for some of the transmission the sars-cov is stable in feces and urine at room temperature for at least 1 to 2 days the virus is more stable up to 4 days in stool from patients with diarrhea which has a higher ph than normal stool16
it is presently unclear at what stage of the disease viral shedding occurs or whether someone who is infected but asymptomatic can infect others as our knowledge of sars and the etiologic coronavirus evolves we will be able to address these important issuessome close contacts have reported a mild febrile illness without respiratory signs or symptoms suggesting the illness might not always progress to the respiratory phase others have not become ill at all in contrast super spreaders have been described who have infected 10 or more contacts including hcws family and social contacts or visitors to the health care facilities where patients were hospitalized a similar phenomenon has been described with some other diseases such as rubella laryngeal tuberculosis and ebola virus and might be the result of a combination of host environment and virus interactions in singapore 5 super spreaders were responsible for a total of 170 suspect and probable cases of sars17 additional data on the natural history of infection are needed to understand factors that might be associated with this phenomenon regardless of whether it is the result of other transmission routes inadequate infection-control measures or more viral shedding by certain patients the fact remains that transmission of the sars virus is highly efficient in some circumstancesthe initial diagnosis of sars is one of exclusion hence common causes of respiratory illnesses should be sought initial diagnostic testing for patients with suspected sars should include chest radiography pulse oximetry blood cultures sputum gram stain and culture and testing for other respiratory pathogens notably influenza a and b respiratory syncytial virus and legionella table 2
 clinicians should save any available clinical specimens respiratory blood serum and stool for additional testing until a specific diagnosis is madeacute and convalescent 21 days after onset of symptoms serum samples should be collected from each patient who meets the sars case definition paired sera and other clinical specimens can be forwarded through state and local health departments for testing at the cdc specific instructions for collecting specimens from suspected sars patients are available from the cdc18 laboratory diagnostic tests used at the cdc to test clinical specimens for evidence of sars-cov include serology pcr testing and viral culturesserologic testing for coronavirus antibody consists of indirect fluorescent antibody testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays that are specific for antibody produced after infection patients seem to seroconvert at a mean of 10 days after onset of symptoms the cdc has made reagents for sars antibody testing available to state public health laboratoriesan rt-pcr test specific for rna from the sars-cov has been positive within the first 10 days after fever onset in respiratory specimens from most patients considered probable cases of sars who have been tested and in stool samples in the second week of illness the duration of detectable viremia or viral shedding needs further study12 13
despite the fact that several thousand specimens from patients with sars have been processed in laboratories worldwide to date there have been no reported clusters of illness in laboratory workers nevertheless reasonable precautions should be taken in handling these specimens the cdc recommends that specimens from patients with sars be labeled accordingly and that the laboratory be alerted before the samples are sent laboratory workers who handle these specimens should use standard precautions in a biosafety level 2 laboratory any procedure with the potential to generate fine particulate aerosols should be performed in a biological safety cabinet19
there is no specific treatment currently available for sars management consists of supportive care and appropriate infection control measures to prevent spread because the diagnosis is uncertain empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia should be administered by using antibiotics with activity against both typical and atypical respiratory pathogens including influenza when appropriate in all series of sars cases described to date therapy has involved broad-spectrum antibiotics including a fluoroquinolone or macrolide the antiviral drug ribavirin has been used in most patients treated in hong kong and in toronto without evidence of efficacy7 10 the adverse effects of ribavirin are significant particularly hemolytic anemia and electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia hence empirical therapy with ribavirin is not warrantedanecdotal evidence suggests that corticosteroids may be beneficial particularly in patients with progressive pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia various regimens have been used in different centers with dosages of methylpred-nisolone ranging from 40 mg twice daily similar to therapy for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to 2 mgkg per day similar to late-phase therapy for ards to pulse doses of 500 mg intravenously per day20 because corticosteroids have potential adverse effects clinicians should carefully assess the risk vs the benefit on a case-by-case basisearly identification of patients with sars in health care facilities and appropriate isolation are essential in preventing large outbreaks the cdc has recommended that in health care settings patients should be screened with targeted questions as soon as possible after arrival or while the patient is on the telephone making an appointment we have been using a simple screening tool figure 2
 to screen all patients in our facility patients who have positive findings on the initial screen are given a mask separated from other patients placed in an examination room a negative-air room if available and evaluated further by a physician with airborne n-95 respirator and contact gown gloves precautions if during this evaluation the patient fits the cdc case definition for sars and needs admission the patient is admitted to a negative-air room if admission is unnecessary but further testing is required the patient is escorted to appropriate areas for laboratory tests radiological studies etc and testing expedited so that exposure of other patients is minimizeddiagnosis of sars does not automatically necessitate admission patients who do not otherwise need to be admitted to a hospital should be managed as outpatients as long as they can limit interactions outside the homepersons being managed as outpatients should be instructed to wear a surgical mask when in the presence of household members and they should contain respiratory secretions in facial tissue and place these in lined containers for disposal with household waste they should wash their hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer especially after touching respiratory secretions and other body fluids sharing of eating utensils towels and bedding between patients with sars and others should be avoided until these items have been washed with soap and hot water such patients should stay away from work school or other activities in a public place for 10 days after the resolution of fever provided that cough and other respiratory symptoms have resolved or have improved a plan will need to be formulated to decide how these outpatients will obtain food and other supplies such as surgical masks during the period of isolation and how arrangements will be made for travel to and from necessary medical appointmentshousehold members or other close contacts of patients with sars should be advised to wear disposable gloves for any direct contact with body fluids from the patient and to practice good hand hygiene such people should be vigilant for the development of fever or respiratory symptoms and if these occur they should seek health care evaluation they should inform their health care provider in advance of arriving for the evaluation that they have had close contact with a patient with sars so that arrangements can be made as necessary to prevent transmission to others in the health care setting in the absence of fever or respiratory symptoms they need not limit their activities outside the homepatients who require hospitalization should be admitted to a negative pressure specially ventilated room visitors should be discouraged the number of hcws involved in the patients care should be limited all hcws should use personal protective equipment appropriate for standard contact and airborne precautions ie hand hygiene gown gloves and n-95 respirator in addition to eye protection while caring for these patients procedures that result in coughing and aerosolization of respiratory secretions should be avoided if bronchoscopy is considered essential for patient care it should be performed by experienced personnel using maximum infection control precautions table 3
an important feature of the sars outbreaks in canada singapore and hong kong has been the fact that several hcws have developed sars after caring for patients with sars transmission to hcws appears to have occurred after close unprotected contact with symptomatic individuals this has placed additional strain on health care systems that have already been stressed by outbreaks of sarsactive surveillance for fever and respiratory symptoms eg daily screening should be conducted in hcws with unprotected exposure for 10 days after the exposure including checking the temperature when the employee reports to work and taking a history of respiratory symptoms workers with unprotected exposure who develop fever andor respiratory symptoms should not come to work they should stay home and report symptoms to infection control or the employee health service immediately health care workers with unprotected exposure during aerosolgenerating procedures intubation suctioning bronchos-copy etc should be quarantined for a 10-day period at home because these procedures pose a higher risk of disease transmissioncase definitions of sars are currently based on the presence of epidemiological risk factors close contact with patients with sars or travel to sars-affected areas and a combination of fever and respiratory symptoms with or without chest radiographic changes however if sars spreads into the general population our ability to distinguish it from other community-acquired pneumonias based on such epidemiological linkages will fail if this happens sars will need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of any community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia a typical history suggestive laboratory values and failure to respond to conventional antibiotics should raise suspicion diagnostic tests will be crucial in the future both to ensure that patients are isolated rapidly and to provide appropriate therapysars has resulted in important challenges for the medical community in affected areas policies are changing daily as more information about the virus and the disease is obtainedthe resurgence of cases in toronto in early may 2003 shows the difficulty of maintaining control over a new disease characterized by many puzzling epidemiological and clinical features the continued alertness of singapore which most recently broke the chain of sars transmission shows the importance of maintaining a high level of vigilance and preparedness to ensure that a single imported case does not reignite an outbreak currently control depends on prompt detection and isolation of cases good infection control in hospitals and the tracing and quarantine of contactssevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a novel coronavirus that has provoked the global pandemic of covid-19 first reported in the city of wuhan china its emergence quickly triggered a lockdown within wuhan and the surrounding cities 1 requiring people to remain at home only leaving for essential journeys since then the virus has spread rapidly worldwide leading the world health organization to declare a global pandemic on the 11th of march globally the outbreak has spread to 210 countries and territories with 3007194 confirmed cases 207265 deaths and 883298 recovered individuals as of the 27th of april viewed on april 27 2020 1042 gmt 2 3containment of the virus has proven challenging although some patients will require intensive care others have unreported mild symptoms with as many as 179 of infected individuals possibly being asymptomatic 4 those with compromised immunities underlying health conditions and of old age are most at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and subsequent respiratory failure necessitating the use of mechanical ventilators in a dedicated intensive care unit icu 5 this mass spread of infection and increasing pressure on hospital capacity has led the uk to follow the example of neighboring european countries by officially implementing a lockdown as of march 23rd while this appears to have slowed the spread of infection the cost to the economy of such measures is considerable with the first 15 months of lockdown estimated to have cost the uk 34 of its gdp 6 with a viable vaccine still several months or years away lockdown measures will eventually need to be lifted but this must be done without risk of overwhelming the health service if all restrictions are lifted universally this could trigger a rapid resurgence of infections and cause further deathhere we consider a two-way balance which aims to i maximize the number of people able to work outside of lockdown while ii ensuring that the number of people with covid-19 requiring medical help at no point crosses a threshold beyond which hospitals are unable to cope as an immediate termination of lockdown for all is likely to trigger a surge in infections a graded easing of lockdown restrictions is likely required the focus of our analysis is to understand the optimal pathway by which to release people as safely as possible back into a general and growing non-quarantined set of workersto understand how to restart the economy yet avoid the saturation of health services we present decision-making as a problem in optimal control to determine an optimal solution requires two definitions the first is a system of process-based differential equations whose boundary conditions or other attributes can be varied by policy decisions the second definition is an objective function metric which depends on the balance and extent to which our two conditions are fulfilled the aim is to solve the differential equations and find decisions affecting their boundary conditions that are optimal and maximize the objective function our equation set is based on a standard susceptible exposed infected recovered seir model framework 7 each of the four compartments has a modeled population and as time evolves people move through each class toward recovery or death the novel part of our analysis is that the seir equations are solved for two groups ie communities the first community is a non-quarantined group and during the full lockdown this represents the essential workers required to maintain health provision or essential services the second community is those in quarantine the main distinction between the non-quarantine and quarantine groups is that in the latter lockdown causes a much lower rate of virus transmissionseir-based equations are solved for non-quarantine and quarantine groups connected by modeled release strategies from lockdown that is we allow different fractions of the quarantined group to move into the non-quarantined group and at different times for each potential strategy of movement between the two groups an objective function is calculatedsome metric describing the desirability of such a strategy this is high when many people are removed from quarantine as they are available to worka desirable outcome however its value switches to a near-infinite negative should the health service threshold be crossed due to high infection numbers our model calculates the highest possible objective function the optimal strategy and returns the number of release dates their time of occurrence and the number of people at each time for comparison we perform parallel simulations where we release all in quarantine to the non-quarantine pool but allow the return to quarantine later if necessary should infections risk exceeding the capacity of the health services we herein refer to this as a lockdown on-off release strategy and again find optimal timings and number of releasesno mathematical model especially for something as complicated as virus transmission and human behaviors can make predictions accurate to within a small margin of error however models are especially useful in two circumstances and that we exploit first although simulations may lack absolute precision predictions will have some level of robustness such predictions give strong indications of expected responses to a range of different boundary conditions ie alternative release scenarios numerical model flexibility and speed of operation enables what if questions to be asked of alternative forms of graded lockdown release second by repeated operation of a model it is possible to scan across ranges of parameter values after governments start to release people changes to infection levels can be compared against ensembles of simulations with perturbed parameters data-model comparison allows selection of the most appropriate parameter value an approach sometimes referred to as adaptive learning the trajectory for that value becomes a more reliable forecast for the days and weeks beyond the available data evidence this approach is feasible is illustrated in data of infections in countries before and during a lockdown although there is substantial geographic variation all curves have similar forms amenable to parameterization indeed politicians have frequently described a mathematical functional form with the expression flattening the curve used to explain why lockdown is essential to avoid overwhelming health servicesour aim is to generate dynamical predictions and help inform the debate as to future lockdown release options each simulation can be readily understood in terms of policy decisions and mathematically this implies careful parameterization our model is parameter sparse yet sufficiently complex to capture a broad range of options critically each parameter is related to understandable quantities characterizing infection levels or lockdown decisions a central part of our analysis in the absence of much knowledge of the sars-cov-2 virus is to vary our fundamental parameters to determine their effect on the optimal strategy this identification of sensitivity aids understanding and can identify research priorities crucial to enhancing our understanding and ability to manage the covid-19 pandemicour model considers two parallel seir susceptible exposed infected recovered systems one describing the spread of disease in the quarantined lockdown population and the other capturing the spread amongst those at work the key difference between our two seir pools those in lockdown and those who are not is that transmission of the disease is assumed to be lower for those in a state of lockdown due to the self-isolation measures in place this means that the susceptible population sq are still able to become infected moving to eq as they leave their homes for essential trips or from people they share homes with albeit at a greatly reduced rate relative to those not in a state of lockdown s under full lockdown the latter pool contains only front-line workers who are unable to adopt social-distancing measures this is captured by the following system of ordinary differential equationswhere nt  stetitrt and nqt  sqteqtiqt  rqt and the subscript q denotes that an individual is currently under lockdown conditionsour equations describe the movement of individuals through four stages from being initially susceptible to the disease s sq contracting the disease but not yet being infectious e eq becoming infectious i iq and finally recovering from the disease r rq at which point we assume an individual becomes immune to future infections figure 1 the function ut describes the release strategy employed controlling the movement of individuals between the quarantined and released groupsthe lowercase greek letters in equations 18 represent our rate parameters firstly  represents the transmission rate of the disease significant work early in the pandemic used available data to quantify the rate of sars-cov-2 transmission and a range of estimates have already been reported in the literature kucharski et al 8 calculated an r0 of 115477 when fitting to data from the initial outbreak in wuhan this corresponds in our case to a  ranging from roughly 025106 similarly when fitting to data from the initial outbreak in italy giordano et al 9 estimated a total transmission rate of 1048 split between the four different infected classes they considered these data-fit estimations risk failing to capture the impact of asymptomatic or unrecorded individuals especially for the wider-ranging classes of our model with a vision toward informing policy for this reason our sensitivity analyses below also consider transmission rates up to twice as high as these values note that we consider the population of both i and iq to impact the spread of disease as the quarantined group are still assumed to mix occasionally with the population for instance when leaving their homes to shop for essential items the parameter c is a scalar between 0 and 1 that captures how effective the self-isolation ie lockdown measures enforced are in reducing the rate of sars-cov-2 transmission represents the natural background death rate of the population regardless of the impact of covid-19 and can have important implications for the strength of herd-immunity effects on disease dynamics as this is the only mechanism in our model through which the recovered population is reduced the parameter  represents the rate of death directly attributed to sars-cov-2 while the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 has been demonstrated to vary substantially between age classes 1012 in its current form our model does not incorporate age-structure and we therefore adopt an age-invariant mortality ratethe parameter  represents the incubation rate the exposed population classes e eq capture the effect of the lag between people becoming infected and incubating the disease for several days and becoming infectious understanding the size of this effect is of great importance when assessing strategies in which a second lockdown may be enforced because efforts to monitor the subsequent spread of infection must consider the upcoming but lagged threat posed by the exposed class lastly  represents the recovery rate and describes how long individuals remain infectiousin the present work we used the population of the united kingdom as an example to inform our initial proportion of the population in quarantine using labor force survey data from 201819 the institute for fiscal studies estimate that 71 million adults across the uk are in the set of key-worker guidelines set out by the uk government 13 we define this 1042 of the population as not currently being in lockdown and initiate the model with the remaining population in lockdown initial numbers of individuals in each class were calculated using estimates presented by flaxman et al 14 with the assumed values valid as of the 28th of march 2020all model variables parameters and the values used for these are presented in table 1 the full set of parameter estimates obtained with links to the original sources have been collated and made available in appendix 1 to aid the modeling efforts of other research groupsfirstly the extent and longevity of immunity to sars-cov-2 and its effect on the dynamics of the pandemic remain open high priority research questions 22 23 recent modeling efforts have however thus far shown little difference when incorporating the impact of waning immunity 9 we therefore assume that once developed immunity provides complete and indefinite protection against sars-cov-2the parsimonious nature of our model was chosen to enhance the ease of interpretation of our results and most importantly to enable the model to be quickly adapted to non-uk populations different countries currently provide varying levels of epidemiological detail in their reporting of covid-19 cases by reducing the number of classes and parameters considered our model is amenable to a wider range of countries and scenarios than the more specific model structures currently published 9 24 the result of this modeling choice is that our system captures the broad-scale dynamics of the disease resulting from different lockdown exit-strategies rather than making accurate predictions of the number of infected individuals which will require continuous data-driven adaptations applied to our frameworkwhile the model parameters are obtained from current research estimates see table 1 these values will continue to evolve as the scientific community updates and improves these estimates in light of new data and understanding as such our model code was designed with usability in mind such that all simulations can be quickly re-calculated to reflect any new research in light of this present uncertainty our current results are shown as a series of sensitivity analyses so that the underlying infection dynamics in response to each release strategy and parameter-dependence are cleara gradual release strategy aims to end the lockdown of the public from quarantine through multiple staggered releases expressed mathematically we seek to release m1 people at time t1 while ensuring that i  iq  ithresh at all times we iterate across a large mesh of potential values for m1 and t1 and for each trial we calculate the objective functional c1  m1  t1  ji iq where ji iq is a penalty function that heavily penalizes any iteration that results in it  iqt  ithresh for any t formallytherefore the optimum choice of m1 and t1 are those which maximize c1 in short this approach calculates how to release as many individuals as possible as early as possible without breaking the infection carrying capacity after this optimum solution is found a second release of m2 people at time t2 can be similarly calculated after the first release if people still remain in quarantineto calculate these outputs we used ode45 a fourth-order runge-kutta solver in matlab to solve the system of equations 18 using the initial conditions in table 1 for t from 0 to t1 at this point we subtracted m1 individuals proportionally from sq eq iq and rq and added these to s e i and r the system was then solved again from these new points for t from t1 to 400 days to allow understanding of the effect of different values of some of the parameters presented in table 1 we operate our model for a range of parameter values specifically this was performed for a range of different transmission rates  infection thresholds ithresh and transmission reduction c figure 2 depicts an illustrative example of a gradual release scenariothe on-off release strategy considers releasing the quarantined population all at once with the aim to then return everyone to lockdown when required should the number of infected exceed a threshold which threatens to overwhelm medical services formally we seek i pairs of tioff and tion a time at which to end quarantine and a time to re-instate it respectively consistent with the gradual release strategy we iteratively trial multiple potential values of tioff and tion where tiontiofffor each choice of tioff and tion we calculate an objective functional cition-tioff-tioff-jiiq where ji iq is as defined above the optimum choice of tioff and tion is the pair that maximizes c in short we seek the longest possible duration out of quarantine as soon as possible without breaking the infection carrying capacity we plot an example of an on-off release scenario in figure 3 belowthe number of people to be released from quarantine m1 was divided into a mesh of 1000 equally-spaced points ranging from 0 to the total quarantined population nq0 each one of these trial values for m1 was simulated against a mesh of 1000 equally-spaced points ranging from 0 to 400 for an associated release time t1 once an optimum solution was found a second optimum release pair m2 individuals released at time t2 was also found unless specified otherwise the base values used are ithresh4106 c  005   235 180365   01961   000657 and   02222 these values are the same as presented in table 1 the optimum solution was found for a range of values of  c and ithresh to observe how these uncertainties affect the optimum solution these solutions are presented in figure 4 where the top row plots ac display the total quarantined population nq under the optimum release strategy and the second row displays the associated total infected population i  iqfrom figure 4 we see that varying the infection threshold ithresh or the lockdown effectiveness c has the greatest impact on mi the number of people released while the time of initial release ti remains mostly unchanged this suggests that an increase of 1000000 to ithresh can allow 4000000 more people to be released from quarantine changes to transmission  instead primarily adjusts the time at which releases are made with the number of people released remaining relatively consistent figure 4b shows that for each trialed transmission value 50 of the quarantined population can be released once the current infected population reaches a sufficiently low level in each case there is approximately a 2-weeks period between when the peak in infected individuals has ended and when individuals are released from quarantine figure 4c shows that for less-effective lockdown measures more individuals are able to be released from quarantine once the initial peak has ended this seemingly counter-intuitive result is due to the reduced lockdown effectiveness meaning that a greater proportion of the quarantined population have been infected while in quarantine and have since entered the recovered class this means they can be re-added to the working pool without substantial risk of further infections this result however clearly depends on the strength of any acquired immunityadditional to the graphical sensitivity analysis presented in figure 4 a quantitative sensitivity analysis was also conducted on each model parameter for each parameter we calculated the total sensitivity index 25 sti a variance-based sensitivity metric that shows how important a model parameter is in affecting a certain model outcome in this study the model outcome considered is the objective function c for our optimum strategy defined formally the total sensitivity index for parameter i is sti1-veyxivy where y is the model outcome monitored and xi is the parameter considered xi here represents fixing all parameters except for parameter i the total sensitivity index is equal to 1 minus the variance in the expected outcome when all parameters except the one in question are fixed divided by the variance if no parameters are fixedin essence for each model parameter a value between 0 and 1 is calculated that describes how sensitive the optimum release strategy is to that parameter with a value nearer unity being more sensitive total sensitivity indexes were calculated for     c and ithresh in descending order these were estimated through monte carlo sampling to be   04978   03928 ithresh  01994   00958 c  00018   00006 we therefore find that our optimum release strategy is not strongly dependent on the values of the disease-induced death rate the lockdown effectiveness or the incubation rate  c or  and that in monitoring the effectiveness and outcome of a release strategy the recovery rate and transmission rate of the disease should be most closely studiedto determine the optimal timings for an on-off lockdown release strategy both the times at which quarantine was ended tioff and the times at which it was reinstated tion were iterated on a mesh of 500 evenly spaced points across a timespan of 0400 once one optimum release pair was found the process was repeated up to two further times to identify subsequent optimum releases as necessary unless otherwise stated the base values used were ithresh4106 c  005   15 180365   01961   000657 and   02222 which are again the same values listed in table 1 a lower base value of  was used as it was considered unlikely that the population would be released from quarantine without certain social-distancing policies being implemented the optimum solution was found for a range of different values of  c and ithresh these solutions are presented in figure 5from figure 5 we see that in all scenarios it is never optimal to leave the entire population out of quarantine for long notably we see in every instance that the optimum solution results in quarantine only being lifted for periods of 12 weeks this presents a very narrow window of time to be able to monitor the rise in infections there was no distinguishable change in dynamic behavior between the different parameters sampled we see in figure 5b that increasing the transmission of the disease required the initial quarantine to be ended later and for subsequent quarantines to be enforced for a longer duration all optimum solutions do however result in rapidly increasing herd immunity by moving a large number of individuals to the recovered class this difference can be seen by noting the difference in timescale on the horizontal axes of figures 4 5just as with the gradual release strategy total sensitivity indices were calculated via the same method for our optimum on-off strategy in descending order and for the on-off strategy these now become   06371 ithresh  03775   02973   02821 c  00478   00045 we see that the order of sensitivity is roughly the same as for the gradual release strategy however all values except for  show increased sensitivity on the optimal result the impact of the incubation period is the most substantially different and this is due to the shorter durations of time people are out of quarantine in the optimum solution meaning small changes to the incubation period may have large unexpected impacts on the surge in infected individualshere we have investigated the optimal release of individuals from a state of lockdown the primary conclusion of our work is that a gradual release strategy is preferable to an on-off release strategy we conclude this from the finding that a population-wide instantaneous release would cause the number of infected individuals to rise dramatically in a short period of time any decision to begin easing lockdown measures will require constant monitoring and a high-level of population testing to track the likely rise toward a second-peak of infections we show that employing a gradual release strategy where groups of the population are slowly released from quarantine sequentially will slow the arrival of any subsequent infection peaks compared to an on-off strategy where lockdown is ended for all individuals imminently and reinstated when subsequent infections begin to increase in all considered instances ie parameter variations it will not be possible to end lockdown for the entire population for any longer than 2 weeks as the number of infected individuals is then expected to quickly overwhelm the health service following such a release by ensuring that the increase in the number of infected individuals is as slow as possible this will enable health officials to monitor more accurately the evolving situation and provide more time to respond to unexpected increases in the number of infected individuals we note that our approach does not consider the ethical responsibilities that will also impact any policy decision if enough hospital provision was available many more people can return to employment but we recognize this will result in increased risk of further mortalities as many governments state however a functioning economy is more able to provide health provision to those with life-threatening illnesses unrelated to covid-19for a gradual release strategy our simulations broadly suggest that a large section of the population should be released from lockdown initially after the first peak of infections has fully passed the rest of the population may then be released 34 months later following a likely second peak in infections again in a general context it is optimal to wait for 12 weeks after the end of an infection peak before releasing any of the population from lockdown while it is desirable to return the population to work as early as possible our optimal calculation states that this 12 weeks wait period is crucial in ensuring that the number of infected individuals is as low as possible when ending any lockdown measures to reduce the growth of new cases after this sufficient cautious wait period has ended people should then be released from quarantine with the knowledge that as many as 1 in 100 of them under the worst-case scenario may require critical care 10 in the coming months it is expected that a second peak in infections may be observed 12 months after this release date and that the remaining population in quarantine should remain so until once again several weeks of low newly infected cases daily have been observedwhat we have not undertaken here is to investigate or advocate any particular forms of changed behaviors that might be needed by those released although understanding them can allow parameters such as transmission rates to be adjusted in our framework additional measures proposed include reopening local connections before connecting cities further apart 26 differential release times based on age 2729 on-going social distancing 9 30 31 contact tracing using mobile applications 32 and behavior monitoring 33 case-finding 34 and cyclic schedules eg short working weeks 35 36placing our analysis in the context of other studies mulheirn et al 34 provide a particularly broad and qualitative assessment of ranges of possible exit strategies from lockdown these include release times potentially dependent on age sector or geographical region and the latter including metrics of local health capacity such measures can be in tandem with strong policies to shield the most vulnerable the authors note that with varied approaches to lockdown release by differing countries there is an opportunity to learn from this by intercomparison undoubtedly all countries leaving lockdown however implemented will heavily scrutinize data for any evidence of an emerging second wave of infections noted is the potential for raised levels of testing in tandem with contact tracing for anyone found to be infected to slow the spread of covid-19 while at least a partial restarting of society occurs for all of the options considered by mulheirn et al 34 if the related parameters can be estimated with at least some certainty then we believe our flexible model structure can adopt these hence our simulation framework provides a mechanism to place any suggested lockdown plans on a quantitative basis furthermore where flexibility exists in release times then for a given strategy calculation of an optimal solution is possiblethe nearest analysis to ours found in the literature based on both a seir framework and applied to covid-19 is by german et al 28 their version of the seir equations place more complexity into the infection component differentiating between alternative levels of seriousness with which a person has the illness ie from asymptomatic through to requiring intensive care they also allow for uncertainty as to whether people who recover are immunean issue likely to be resolved once antibody tests become routinely available hence people post-infection can in the model be returned to the susceptible pool german et al 28 conclude that without retaining some constraints on the population after the termination of lockdown then there would be an overwhelming increase in infections such constraints include social distancing isolation of infectious people and contact tracing they further stress the importance of a considerable increase in the testing of individuals to best inform any release decisions their conclusions align with many of our findings however rather than assessing constraints applied to the entire population as released simultaneously our primary focus is to consider additional flexibility to constrain infection levels by a gradual release from lockdownwhilst we believe that our model framework does have predictive capability we do raise a couple of caveats we recommend exploring our findings within a variety of other model frameworks stochastic frameworks may be better suited to model the exact time periods when populations are first reintroduced so as to better calculate the range of time frames until a second wave of infections in a probabilistic setting likewise compartmental infection models such as those presented by giordano et al 9 will be able to provide more accurate estimations on any expected hospital intake our model is broad enough to allow it to be applied to countries outside of the uk simply by initializing at the alternate initial conditions and setting some parameters that will be country-specific this however must be supported by an agreed uniform definition of our basic model parameters and case confirmation definition to ensure that model validation is compatible with the respective countryin preparing to monitor the situation upon easing lockdown measures our sensitivity analysis highlights that the recovery rate of the disease  above is the most critical parameter in understanding the magnitude of any subsequent peaks in infection our calculations can be trusted further if that value is well-understood for example if new hospitalized patients of covid-19 appeared to be remaining symptomatic and infectious for longer than previously estimated it is plausible to assume within the general community that the disease is therefore being transmitted faster than previously expected this knowledge could trigger preparations for a potential need to reinstate lockdown measures hence further research efforts into the infectious period should also therefore be prioritized in a similar vein the parameter to which results are second-most sensitive is transmission rate  and so also worthy of precise researcha potential benefit of the on-off release strategy is that it greatly increases the number of people subsequently moved to the recovered class rapidly bolstering the acquisition of herd-immunity this in theory would enable the full re-opening of the economy at an earlier date however it makes the critical assumption that recovered individuals would remain immune to the disease the nature of immunity to sars-cov-2 is an open question and efforts are being made to understand its strength and longevity but currently the who advises that there is no evidence yet to suggest that recovered covid-19 patients have ongoing immunity to a second infection 37 in light of this the more cautious gradual release strategy remains even more preferable as the scientific community continues its efforts to develop a viable vaccinein conclusion using an optimal control methodology we have shown that a gradual staggered release of individuals out of lockdown is recommended to ensure that health systems are not overwhelmed by a surge in infected individuals it has been well-observed that older individuals are more likely to require critical care as a result of covid-19 10 although our analysis does not as yet differentiate by age who should be in any partial lockdown releases this does indicate that potentially the younger population could be the first to be released from lockdown this would further ease any subsequent strain on the health system and potentially further bolster a herd-immunity effect we stress however that any decision to gradually release a proportion of the population by demographic criteria must be supported by periodical biomolecular investigation into the infectivity of such a group as any sector released from quarantine will immediately be at increased risk and may infect others ongoing population testing following a release from lockdown will be critical in ascertaining whether the infected population is growing in accordance with model projections if large differences are observed early re-initializations of the model should be performed similarly our analysis does not model the capability of businesses and individuals who have the infrastructure and availability to continue to work remotelythe ongoing threat of covid-19 will require continual monitoring and study in the coming months it is important to ensure that infections are kept to a minimum and that the government and relevant services are given enough time to prepare for increases in infections the findings of this study stress that gradual and cautious action must be taken when easing lockdown measures to save resources and lives while adding to the evidence base of
