severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged for the first time in wuhan china in december 2019 it is a type of highly pathogenic human coronavirus hcov that causes zoonotic diseases and poses a major threat to public health the vast majority of patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 have had a good prognosis but there were still some critical individuals and even deaths1
most of these critically ill and dead patients did not develop severe clinical manifestations in the early stages of the disease some of the patients only showed mild fever cough or muscle soreness the conditions of these patients deteriorated suddenly in the later stages of the disease or in the process of recovery acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple-organ failure occurred rapidly resulting in death within a short time2 cytokine storm is considered to be one of the major causes of ards and multiple-organ failure3 it plays an important role in the process of disease aggravation4 clinical studies have detected a cytokine storm in critical patients with covid-19 therefore effectively suppressing the cytokine storm is an important way to prevent the deterioration of patients with covid-19 infection and save the patients lives5 this article reviews the mechanisms by which hcov infection induces cytokine storm and the options to inhibit the cytokine storm in order to provide a reference for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of covid-19coronaviruses covs are single-stranded positive-strand rna viruses belonging to the coronaviridae family nidovirales order the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv classifies the covs into four categories    and  under the electron microscope the virus particles display a rough spherical or multi-faceted crystal shape the surface of the viruses has prominent club-shaped projections composed of its spike protein inside the virus particle is the viral genome wrapped in a nucleocapsid the viral genome contains approximately 26000 to 32000 bases covs are the largest known rna viruses the positive-strand viral rna consists of a cap structure at the 5 end and multiple polya tails at the 3 end it serves as messenger rna mrna allowing the translation of replicasetranscriptase and viral structural proteins the replicasetranscriptase genes account for approximately 23 of the 5-end rna sequence and are composed of two overlapping open reading frames orfs orf1a and orf1b the orfs encode 16 non-structural proteins the remaining 13 of the rna sequence encodes four classical viral structural proteins namely spike s protein envelope e protein membrane m protein and nucleocapsid n protein in addition genes encoding some viral accessory proteins are interspersed in the coding regions of the viral structural proteins the coding sites and number of these accessory protein genes are an important basis for cov classification covs can infect a variety of host species including birds humans and some other vertebrates these viruses mainly cause respiratory and intestinal infections and induce a variety of clinical manifestations6

coronaviruses have long been recognized as important pathogens that infect the respiratory tracts of domestic and companion animals and are the causes of mild and severe respiratory diseases in humans7

8 so far seven hcovs that can invade humans have been identified including the -type hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 the -type hcov-hku1 sars-cov mers-cov and hcov-oc43 and 2019-ncov causing the present epidemic according to their pathogenicity hcovs are divided into mildly pathogenic hcovs including hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku and highly pathogenic covs including severe acute respiratory syndrome cov sars-cov9 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 10

11 and sars-cov-2 the mildly pathogenic hcovs infect the upper respiratory tract and cause seasonal mild to moderate cold-like respiratory diseases in healthy individuals in contrast the highly pathogenic hcovs hereinafter referred to as pathogenic hcovs or hcovs infect the lower respiratory tract and cause severe pneumonia sometimes leading to fatal acute lung injury ali and ards the pathogenic hcovs have high morbidity and mortality and pose a major threat to public health12 13 14
it has long been believed that cytokines play an important role in immunopathology during viral infection a rapid and well-coordinated innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infection however dysregulated and excessive immune responses may cause immune damage to the human body15 16 17 the relevant evidences from severely ill patients with hcovs suggest that proinflammatory responses play a role in the pathogenesis of hcovs in vitro cell experiments show that delayed release of cytokines and chemokines occurs in respiratory epithelial cells dendritic cells dcs and macrophages at the early stage of sars-cov infection later the cells secrete low levels of the antiviral factors interferons ifns and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin il-1 il-6 and tumor necrosis factor tnf and chemokines c-c motif chemokine ligand ccl-2 ccl-3 and ccl-518 19 20 like sars mers-cov infects human airway epithelial cells thp-1 cells a monocyte cell line human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and dcs and induces delayed but elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines21

22 after mers-cov infection plasmacytoid dendritic cells but not mononuclear macrophages and dcs23 are induced to produce a large amount of ifnsserum cytokine and chemokine levels are significantly higher in patients with severe mers than patients with mild to moderate mers24

25 the elevated serum cytokine and chemokine levels in mers patients are related to the high number of neutrophils and monocytes in the patients lung tissues and peripheral blood suggesting that these cells may play a role in lung pathology24 25 26 similar phenomena have been observed in patients with sars-cov infection27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 the production of ifn-i or ifn- is the key natural immune defense response against viral infections and ifn-i is the key molecule that plays an antiviral role in the early stages of viral infection35

36 delayed release of ifns in the early stages of sars-cov and mers-cov infection hinders the bodys antiviral response36 afterward the rapidly increased cytokines and chemokines attract many inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and monocytes resulting in excessive infiltration of the inflammatory cells into lung tissue and thus lung injury it appears from these studies that dysregulated andor exaggerated cytokine and chemokine responses by sars-cov-infected or mers-cov-infected cells could play an important role in pathogenesis of sars or mersanimal models can well elucidate the role of cytokines and chemokines in mediating pulmonary immunopathology after hcov infection despite of similar virus titers in the respiratory tract sars-cov-infected old nonhuman primates are more likely to develop immune dysregulation than the infected young primates leading to more severe disease manifestations37 it seems that the excessive inflammatory response rather than the virus titer is more relevant to the death of the old nonhuman primates37 similarly in balbc mice infected with sars-cov disease severity in old mice is related to the early and disproportionately strong upregulation of the ards-related inflammatory gene signals38 the rapid replication of sars-cov in balbc mice induces the delayed release of ifn- which is accompanied by the influx of many pathogenic inflammatory mononuclear macrophages15 the accumulated mononuclear macrophages receive activating signals through the ifn- receptors on their surface and produce more monocyte chemoattractants such as ccl2 ccl7 and ccl12 resulting in the further accumulation of mononuclear macrophages these mononuclear macrophages produce elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines tnf il-6 il1- and inducible nitric oxide synthase thereby increasing the severity of the disease depleting inflammatory monocyte-macrophages or neutralizing the inflammatory cytokine tnf protected mice from the fatal sars-cov infection in addition ifn- or mononuclear macrophage-derived proinflammatory cytokines induce the apoptosis of t cells which further hinders viral clearance15 another consequence of rapid viral replication and vigorous proinflammatory cytokinechemokine response is the induction of apoptosis in lung epithelial and endothelial cells ifn- and ifn- induce inflammatory cell infiltration through mechanisms involving fasfas ligand fasl or traildeath receptor 5 dr5 and cause the apoptosis of airway and alveolar epithelial cells39 40 41 apoptosis of endothelial cells and epithelial cells damages the pulmonary microvascular and alveolar epithelial cell barriers and causes vascular leakage and alveolar edema eventually leading to hypoxia in the body therefore inflammatory mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of ardsards is the leading cause of death in patients infected with sars-cov or mers-cov42

43 it is now known that several proinflammatory cytokines il-6 il-8 il-1 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and reactive oxygen species and chemokines such as ccl2 ccl-5 ifn-induced protein 10 ip-10 and ccl3 all contribute to the occurrence of ards44 45 46 these results support such points of view that following sars-cov infection high virus titers and dysregulation of cytokinechemokine response cause an inflammatory cytokine storm the inflammatory cytokine storm is accompanied by immunopathological changes in the lungshigh levels of expression of il-1b ifn- ip-10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp-1 have been detected in patients with covid-19 these inflammatory cytokines may activate the t-helper type 1 th1 cell response47 th1 activation is a key event in the activation of specific immunity48 however unlike sars patients patients with covid-19 also have elevated levels of th2 cell-secreted cytokines such as il-4 and il-10 which inhibit the inflammatory response the serum levels of il-2r and il-6 in patients with covid-19 are positively correlated with the severity of the disease ie critically ill patients  severely ill patients  ordinary patients49 other studies have found that compared with covid-19 patients from general wards patients in the intensive care unit icu display increased serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ip-10 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein-1a and tnf- the above studies suggest that the cytokine storm is positively correlated with disease severity47
a report on the severe new-type coronavirus-infected pneumonia showed that 37 patients 712 required mechanical ventilation and 35 patients 673 suffered ards moreover the mortality of the elderly patients with ards was significantly elevated50 the core pathological change in ards is the pulmonary and interstitial tissue damage caused by nonspecific inflammatory cell infiltration51 local excessive release of cytokines is the decisive factor that induces this pathological change and clinical manifestation52 in covid-19 the inflammatory cytokine storm is closely related to the development and progression of ards the serum levels of cytokines are significantly increased in patients with ards and the degree of increase is positively correlated with mortality rate53 the cytokine storm is also a key factor in determining the clinical course of extrapulmonary multiple-organ failure54 this partially explains the signs of extrapulmonary organ failure such as elevated liver enzymes and creatinine seen in some covid-19 patients without respiratory failure suggesting that the inflammatory cytokine storm is the cause of damage to extrapulmonary tissues and organsin summary the new-type coronavirus infection causes an inflammatory cytokine storm in patients the cytokine storm leads to ards or extrapulmonary multiple-organ failure and is an important factor that causes covid-19 exacerbation or even deathhigh virus titer and the subsequent strong inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses are related to the high morbidity and mortality observed during the pathogenic hcov infection the experience from treating sars and mers shows that reducing viral load through interventions in the early stages of the disease and controlling inflammatory responses through immunomodulators are effective measures to improve the prognosis of hcov infection55 56 57 58
ifn- primarily activates epithelial cells and reduces the mononuclear macrophage-mediated proinflammatory activity of ifn-59 in addition ifn- inhibits the recruitment of neutrophils to the sites of inflammation60 sars-cov and mers-cov mainly infect alveolar epithelial cells aec ifn- activates the antiviral genes in epithelial cells thereby exerting antiviral effects without overstimulating the human immune system therefore ifn- may be an ideal treatment some studies have applied pegylated and non-pegylated interferons for the treatment of hcovs but the efficacy varied significantly due to the application of different treatment regimens early administration of interferons has certain benefits in reducing viral load and improves the clinical symptoms of patients to a certain extent however it fails to reduce mortality rates61 62 63 with the exception of early administration the use of interferons at other time periods will not bring more benefits than placebo treatment63
corticosteroids are a class of steroid hormones that have anti-inflammatory functions corticosteroids are commonly used to suppress inflammation during the 2003 sars epidemic corticosteroids were the primary means of immunomodulation timely administration of corticosteroids often leads to early improvements such as reducing fever relieving radiation infiltration of the lung and improving oxygenation64 65 66 a retrospective study of 401 patients with severe sars revealed that proper administration of glucocorticoids in patients with severe sars significantly reduced the mortality rate and shortened the hospital stay moreover secondary infections and other complications rarely occurred in these glucocorticoid-treated patients67 however there are studies showing that administration of corticosteroid therapy during human sars-cov infection led to adverse consequences early treatment of sars patients with corticosteroids increased plasma viral load in non-icu patients resulting in the aggravation of the disease64
in treatment of patients with covid-19 the use of glucocorticoids has again become a major conundrum for clinicians68 the timing of administration and the dosage of glucocorticoids are very important to the outcome of the severely ill patients a too early administration of glucocorticoids inhibits the initiation of the bodys immune defense mechanism thereby increasing the viral load and ultimately leading to adverse consequences therefore glucocorticoids are mainly used in critically ill patients suffering inflammatory cytokine storm inhibition of excessive inflammation through timely administration of glucocorticoids in the early stage of inflammatory cytokine storm effectively prevents the occurrence of ards and protects the functions of the patients organs for patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation indicators rapid imaging progress and excessive inflammatory response the use of glucocorticoid in the short term 35 days is appropriate and the recommended dose is no more than equivalent to methylprednisolone 12 mgkgday69 it should be noted that large doses of glucocorticoid may delay the clearance of coronavirus due to immunosuppressionchen et al analyzed the treatment of 99 wuhan patients with covid-19 and found that 27 of these patients had received ivig treatment70 ivig therapy has the dual effects of immune substitution and immunomodulation its practical application value in treatment of covid-19 needs confirmation in future studiesduring the cytokine storm the three most important cytokines in the il-1 family are il-1 il-18 and il-334 studies that focus on the inhibition of il-1 to reduce the cytokine storm have attracted most attention anakinra an antagonist of il-1 can be used to treat the cytokine storm caused by infection it significantly improved the 28-day survival rate of patients with severe sepsis71 there is currently no clinical experience with applying specific il-1 family blockers to treat covid-19 their effects need to be verified through in vivo animal experiments and clinical trialstocilizumab is an il-6 antagonist that suppresses the function of the immune system currently tocilizumab is mainly applied in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis72 tocilizumab itself has a therapeutic effect on the infection-induced cytokine storm73 serum il-6 level is significantly increased in severely ill patients with covid-19 clinical studies from china have shown that tocilizumab is effective in treating severely ill patients with extensive bilateral lung lesions who have elevated il-6 levels the first dose was 48 mgkg the recommended dosage was 400mg with 09 saline diluted to 100 ml the infusion time was more than 1 h for patients with poor efficacy of the first dose an additional dose can be applied after 12 h the dose is the same as before with a maximum of two cumulative dosetnfs are key inflammatory factors that trigger a cytokine storm they are attractive targets for controlling the cytokine storm a meta-analysis showed that anti-tnf therapy has significantly improved survival in patients with sepsis74 anti-tnf therapy has also achieved satisfactory outcomes in treatment of noninfectious diseases such as atherosclerosis75 studies in animal models have shown that tnfs contribute significantly to acute lung injury and impair the t cell response in sars-cov-challenged mice in mice neutralization of tnf activity or loss of tnf receptor provides protection against sars-cov-induced morbidity and mortality15

76 however it should be noted that at least in the later stages of infection tnf has not been detected in the serum of patients with sars at present tnf blockers have not been suggested in the treatment of patients with covid-19 but the efficacy of tnf blockers in treatment of patients with covid-19 deserves further explorationifn- limits viral replication by inducing ifn-stimulated gene however ifn- also exacerbates diseases through enhancing the recruitment and function of mononuclear macrophages and other innate immune cells although an early interferon response has a protective effect on mice infected with sars-cov delayed ifn- signaling causes an imbalance of the anti-sars-cov immune responses in humans this phenomenon indicates that the timing of ifn treatment is crucial to the outcome of diseases based on these results ifn- receptor blockers or antagonists should be administered in the later stages of severe disease to prevent excessive inflammatory responses16
chloroquine inhibits the production and release of tnf and il-6 which indicates that chloroquine may suppress the cytokine storm in patients infected with covid-1977 chloroquine phosphate has been used in the treatment of adults aged 18 to 65 in china78 the recommended dosage by diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia trial version 7 from china is as follows if the weight is more than 50 kg 500 mg each time 2 times a day 7 days as a treatment course if the weight is less than 50 kg 500 mg each time on the first and second days twice a day 500 mg each time on the third to seventh days once a dayulinastatin is a natural anti-inflammatory substance in the body it protects the vascular endothelium by inhibiting the production and release of inflammatory mediators ulinastatin is widely used in clinical practice to treat pancreatitis and acute circulatory failure ulinastatin reduces the levels of proinflammatory factors such as tnf- il-6 and ifn- and increases the level of anti-inflammatory factor il-1079 these activities of ulinastatin promote the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses in humans thus interrupting the cytokine storm induced by the vicious cycle of inflammation animal studies show that the anti-inflammatory effect of high-dose ulinastatin is equivalent to that of hormones80 however unlike glucocorticoids ulinastatin does not inhibit immune functions and is unlikely to cause sequelae such as femoral head necrosis therefore ulinastatin has great application prospects in the treatment of covid-19in a mouse model of influenza a virus iav infection oxpl increases the production of cytokineschemokines in lung macrophages through the toll-like receptor 4 tlr4tir-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon- signaling pathway thereby promoting the occurrence of ali81 eritoran is a tlr4 antagonist it does not have direct antiviral activity but has strong immunomodulatory functions eritoran effectively lowers the production of oxpl inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in iav-infected mice thereby reducing death82 pathogenic human coronaviruses also cause a high accumulation of oxpl in patients lung tissues resulting in ali81 thus it seems that eritoran and other oxpl inhibitors may also be able to alleviate hcov-induced inflammatory responsessphingosine-1-phosphate s1p is a signal lysophospholipid that promotes cytokine synthesis and secretion83 the s1p receptor signaling pathways significantly inhibit the pathological damage induced by the hosts innate and adaptive immune responses thereby reducing the cytokine storm caused by influenza virus infection84

85 in mouse models of iav infection sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 s1p1 signal transduction in respiratory endothelial cells modulates pathogenic inflammatory responses85 agonists targeting s1p1 inhibit excessive recruitment of inflammatory cells inhibit proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and reduce the morbidity and mortality of iav85

86 sars-cov-2 also mainly infects human lung epithelial cells and endothelial cells therefore s1p1 agonists may be potential therapeutic drugs for reducing cytokine and chemokine responses in those hcov patients whose cells generated excessive immune responses an s1p-receptor modulating drug siponimod was approved in 2019 to treat multiple sclerosis however clinical trials are needed to further verify whether siponimod is an ideal alternative for the treatment of cytokine stormas an important member of the stem cell family mesenchymal stem cells msc not only have the potential of self-renewal and multidirectional differentiation but also have strong anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory functions msc can inhibit the abnormal activation of t lymphocytes and macrophages and induce their differentiation into regulatory t cell treg subsets and anti-inflammatory macrophages respectively it can also inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 tnf- il-6 il-12 and ifn- thereby reducing the occurrence of cytokine storms87

88 at the same time msc can secrete il-10 hepatocyte growth factor keratinocyte growth factor and vegf to alleviate ards regenerate and repair damaged lung tissues and resist fibrosis89 therefore many functions of msc are expected to make it an effective method for the treatment of covid-19in addition the blood purification treatments currently used in clinic practice can remove inflammatory factors to a certain extent blood purification system including plasma exchange adsorption perfusion bloodplasma filtration etc can remove inflammatory factors block the cytokine storm to reduce the damage of inflammatory response to the body this therapy can be used for severe and critical patients in the early and middle stages of the disease the artificial liver technology led by academician li lanjuan can eliminate inflammatory factors on a large scale this technology has also been used to resist the cytokine storm of h7n9 and its application on covid-19 has also achieved certain efficacy90 early renal replacement therapy which is similar to the treatment principle of artificial liver technology seems to be an effective method to control cytokine storm91
an autopsy report of patients with covid-19 revealed a large amount of inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs of the deceased92 one potentially effective treatment approach is to reduce the recruitment of mononuclear macrophages to the site of inflammation through small interfering rna sirna-mediated silencing of c-c chemokine receptor type 2 ccr2 which has been demonstrated by animal experiments to improve the outcome of the disease93

94 toll-like receptor 7 tlr7 agonists stimulate mononuclear macrophages to undergo a strong inflammatory response at the time of infection with single-stranded rna ssrna viruses such as hcov therefore tlr7 antagonists may be able to alleviate the storm of inflammatory factors caused by sars-cov-2 infectionincreased vascular permeability is also a hallmark change that occurs in the process of a cytokine storm it was found in animal infection models of sepsis and h5n1 virus that activation of the endothelial slit-robo4 pathway with drugs improved vascular permeability thereby reducing the occurrence of a cytokine storm during infection95
inflammation is an essential part of an effective immune response it is difficult to eliminate infections successfully without inflammation the inflammatory response begins with an initial recognition of pathogens the pathogens then mediate the recruitment of immune cells which eliminates the pathogens and ultimately leads to tissue repair and restoration of homeostasis however sars-cov-2 induces excessive and prolonged cytokinechemokine responses in some infected individuals known as the cytokine storm cytokine storm causes ards or multiple-organ dysfunction which leads to physiological deterioration and death timely control of the cytokine storm in its early stage through such means as immunomodulators and cytokine antagonists as well as the reduction of lung inflammatory cell infiltration is the key to improving the treatment success rate and reducing the mortality rate of patients with covid-19 fig 1
the authors declare that they have no competing financial interestssince december 2019 the frequent incidence of pneumonia has become a distinctive feature of the infection caused by a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus2 sarscov2 in wuhan hubei province china
1
 on february 11 2020 the world health organization who officially named this pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 covid19
2
 as of may 7 2020 a total of 3672238 confirmed cases and 254045 deaths have been reported in more than 214 countries 86095 confirmed cases and 4643 deaths in china
3
 considering its worldwide reach and severity who declared the covid19 outbreak a global pandemicthe first pandemic sparked by a coronavirus
4
 in contrast to the global infection rate reached by sarscov2 severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus sarscov 20022003 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov 2012 were largely localized to china and saudi arabia respectively
5
 like sarscov2 the outbreak of sarscov and merscov were also caused by the zoonotic coronavirus crossing the species barrier the diseases caused by these three coronaviruses share similarities in clinical presentations such as progression toward severe acute respiratory syndrome
6
 yet covid19s clinical features remain distinct including unique pulmonary presentation on ct
7
 specifically with the sars epidemic dysregulation of the immune system resulted in acute fevers and decreased cd4 and cd8 t cell counts yet lacked any evidence of pulmonary changes upon imaging
8

the most common symptoms observed in covid19 patients are malaise dry cough and high fever symptoms of diarrhea hemoptysis and headache are not uncommon
9
 recently the centers for disease control and prevention usa expanded target symptoms of covid19 to include chills repeated shaking with chills muscle pain headache sore throat and loss of taste or smell disease can be mild or progress toward dyspnea andor hypoxemia or even acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and septic shock which then can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods
10
 the main reason for death outcomes following sarscov2 infection is respiratory failure with changes in heart and liver function as a secondary or related consequence of disease
11
 
12
 
13
 epidemiologic data does suggest certain groups are at particular risk for severe disease outcomes ie elderly select preexisting conditions although we know there is a link between disease severity viral production and a cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome crs it is still unclear which molecular triggers fuel the onset of the cytokine storm and why it can quickly advance to ards or mods with a fatal outcome in a subset of patients
14
 
15
 it remains unknown if the observed cytokine storm and resulting leukocyte changes impact high and lowrisk individuals in the same way and how these factors can turn an otherwise natural protective cytokine response against infection into a lethal pathogenic processin this article we summarize reports on blood cytokine levels and leukocyte activation to examine for differences in immunopathogenesis between mild and severe cases of covid19 in patients from china data were obtained from reports from april 2019 to april 2020 supporting information fig s1 we also discuss emerging concepts on the interphase between leukocyte biology and disease pathogenesis last we summarize findings from ongoing clinical trials in china and united states that seek to control the onset or damage caused by the cytokine storm to reduce both morbidity and mortalitythe release of cytokines in response to infection can lead to mild or severe clinical manifestations the hallmarks of a mildnonlethal cytokine release response to infection include increased local temperature heat myalgia arthralgia nausea rash depression and other mild flulike symptoms concurrent to immune activation the body launches compensatoryrepair processes to restore tissue and organ function the term cytokine storm was first coined in 1993 to describe a graft vshost disease
16
 the term has since been extended to describe the similar sudden cytokine releases associated with autoimmune hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis sepsis cancers acute immunotherapy responses and infectious diseases
17

 cytokine storm occurs when an immune system is overactivated by infection drug andor some other stimuli leading to high levels of cytokines ifn il chemokines csf tnf etc being released into circulation with a widespread and detrimental impact on multiple organs
21
 the severe inflammatory responses induced by a cytokine storm start locally and spread systemically causing collateral damage in tissues
22
 
23
 to date it is unclear what determinants of the host response to infection are responsible for triggering the inflammatory sequence leading to the clinical syndrome associated with high cytokine release in general it is believed to be caused by an imbalance in immunesystem regulation ie increase in immune cell activation via tlr or other mechanism decrease in antiinflammatory response etc although the specific dysregulated molecular causes are still unknown a cytokine storm is nearly always pathogenic because of its detrimental effects on the host on the other hand local and systemic cytokine responses to infection are essential parts of the hosts initial response to infection release of cytokines by natural killer nk cells and macrophages along with activated t cells and humoral responses can help resolve infection accompanied by effector mechanisms such as antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxicity adcc
24
 these responses are triggered to keep the pathogen in check for example the local cytokines such as ifn and il1 produced by epithelial cells can protect nearby cells by stimulating ifnstimulated gene expression and concurrently activating immune competent cells such as nk cells this increases the nk cells lytic potential and fuels the secretion of ifn
25
 in addition to nk cells once myeloid cells such as resident macrophages are activated by ifn it amplifies subsequent tlrmediated stimulation this includes the release of high levels of tnf il12 and il6 which in turn can further modulate nk cells
26
 although il12 acts to increase nk ifn secretion high il6 levels also may limit the immune response by its effects on the cytotoxic activity of nk cells via the downregulation of intracellular perforin and granzyme b levels
27
 as disease progresses t cell and antibody responses give rise to additional cytokine responses leading to greater or sustained antigen release and added tlr ligands from viralinduced cytotoxicity
28
 once these responses are in motion other host or pathogenrelated factors ie decreases in pathogen load antiinflammatory responses genetics work together to prevent a dysregulated response or a crs that if allowed to develop could itself cause tissue damage and organ failure for example a lack of a negative feedback mechanism by il10 and il4 would be expected to increase the severity of cytokine responses toward a pathogenic crs or cytokine storm
21
 on the other hand targeting treatment to disrupt the formation of cytokine storm by using pharmacologic agents such as tocilizumab antiil6 may stabilize the advanced cases from transitioning to a more critical state
27

at the onset of sarscov2 infection there typically is a preferential infection of the respiratory track as a consequence of dropletbased viral transfer however a recent study
30
 supports the theory that sarscov2 also could potentially infect intestine enterocytes directly through angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 ace2 is highly expressed on differentiated enterocytes and may help to explain why diarrhea occurs with acute infection as well as the observed fecal shedding consequently having a broader infection footprint may impact the source of inflammatory cascades to include tissues other than the lungin covid19 disease a cytokine storm is common in patients with severetocritical symptoms at the same time lymphocytes and nk cell counts are sharply reduced with elevations in levels of ddimer creactive protein crp ferritin and procalcitonin
31
 consequences of a lethal cytokine storm exhibit diffuse alveolar damage characterized by hyaline membrane formation and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes
32
 
33
 the collateral tissue damage organ failure and poor outcomes of people with covid19 and its accompanying uncontrolled inflammatory responses share similarities with sars and mers in severe sars patients the serum levels of ifn il1 il6 il12 tgf mcp1 and il8 were higher than patients with mildtomoderate symptoms
34
 
35
 il1 il6 and il8 levels also were increased in the patients severely infected by merscov
36
 leukocyte and cytokine changes with severetocritical sarscov2 infection are further detailed belowin humans both monocytes and macrophages express ace2 and consequently can be infected by sarscov and sarscov2
39
 which results in the activation and transcription of proinflammatory genes
40
 intriguingly infection caused by sarscov2 appears to markedly downregulate the expression of ace2 on peripheral blood pb monocytes on a per cell basis which may be a secondary outcome to viral binding
41
 whether this downregulation of ace2 receptors is a surrogate to viremia remains to be determined in addition the expression of ace2 was found on cd68 and cd169 macrophages in spleen and lymph nodes of covid19 patients providing further evidence that sarscov2 infection may target ace2 positive myeloid cells throughout the body including the spleen and lymph nodes
42
 infected cd169 macrophages are mainly found in the red pulp section of spleens moreover macrophagerich areas at marginal sites of lymph nodes were more likely to test positive for viral nucleocaspid protein antigens of interest previous studies have demonstrated that cd169 macrophages are responsible for controlled levels of viral replication in support of developing immunity as a result of a refractory state to type i ifndependent activation
43
 this indicates that infection of cd169 macrophages might be a conduit for translocation of sarscov2 to spleens and lymph nodes this could be responsible for added systemic viral replication and may contribute to lower immunity see antigenspecific t cell section below human monocytic cell lines thp1 and u939 express ace2
41
 and thus may be useful in the in vitro study of myeloid modulation and role of tlr interactions in triggering activation before and after infection likewise hace2 transgenic mice should be harnessed as an animal model to study the biophysiology as well as the pharmacology of sarscov2 infection
44

monocytes from covid19 patients although normal in number show an activated phenotype as evidenced by their morphology fschigh and their capacity to produce il6 il10 and tnf
41
 activated monocytes present in the pb of covid19 patients were characterized by surface expression of cd11b cd14 cd16 cd68 cd80 cd163 and cd206 activation of the pb monocytes was particularly associated with disease severity and a poor prognosis
41
 expression of cd163 and cd206 by pb monocytes from covid19 patients suggest a bias toward a m2 or regulatory phenotype which could impact adaptive antiviral effector t cell responses apart from immune effects expression of cd163 in activated monocytemacrophage has also been associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome
45
 which could potentially contribute to the hyperproduction of cytokine and immunologic pathogenesis in covid19 patients
46

wen et al
47
 also observed that an abundance of inflammatory cd14il1 and ifnactivated monocytes existed in the pb of covid19 patients in addition sarscov2 was found to trigger macrophages through ace2 generating il6 expression in the spleen and lymph nodes and il6 tnf il10 and pd1 expression from the alveolar macrophages
47
 
48
 this added mechanism might promote lymphocytopenia and contribute to a cytokine storm initiating in the lung as viral levels rise
42
 
48

autopsy reports indicated that inflammatory macrophages accumulated in the lungs of covid19 patients
49
 single cell rna sequencing confirmed that monocytederived fcn1
 macrophages were the predominant subset found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf of covid19 patients with ards which might be indicative of cells with high inflammatory and chemokine production
50
 the transcriptional analysis of balf and pb mononuclear cells from covid19 patients revealed high levels of ifninduced protein 10 ip10 and mcp1 which likely attracted the trafficking of macrophages to the site of infection a finding that is consistent with autopsy reports
51

orchestrated by delayed type i ifn signaling the activation and accumulation of inflammatory monocytemacrophage can result in a dysregulated inflammatory response and apoptosis of t cells
52
 the results of one ex vivo experiment in lung tissue
53
 showed that sarscov2 produced three times more infectious virus particles than did sarscov after 48 h however sarscov2 triggered fewer ifns and proinflammatory mediators than did sarscov this may contribute to the viruss ability to evade intrinsic innate responses at initial infection early type i ifns response may be particularly important preliminary reports showed ifn2b significantly reduced the length of time the virus could be detected in the upper respiratory tract this in turn reduced the duration of elevated blood levels for the inflammatory markers il6 and crp
54
 however the mechanism underlying sarscov2s ability to dampen initial innate responses at acute infection and suppress typei ifns to maximize viral release still needs additional studyas covid19 progresses the number of neutrophils in circulation gradually increase thus elevated neutrophil levels may be useful for predicting the severity of disease
55
 zhang et al
56
 reported that the neutrophiltolymphocyte ratio nlr combined with igg might be a better predictor than neutrophil count alone in predicting the severity of covid19 neutrophil extracellular traps nets which are extracellular webs of dnahistones released by neutrophils to control infections also are known to exacerbate inflammation

 previous studies have revealed that aberrant nets might contribute to ards cystic fibrosis excessive thrombosis and cytokine storm il1
59
 
60
 
61
 
62
 in severe cases of covid19 elevated levels of netosis with cellfree dna and myeloperoxidase mpodna have been noted frequently
63
 indeed when neutrophils from uninfected persons were exposed to serum from covid19 patients in vitro it triggered netosis indicating that patient sera may have the capacity to promote netosis in neutrophils
63
 
64
 apart from contributing to a cytokine storm increased netosis likely also impacts the onset of venous and arterial thrombosis in covid19 patients
65
 this finding raises the hypothesis that nets may be a central dysregulated pathologic mechanism driving cytokine release and multiorgan damage ultimately leading to respiratory failure and coagulopathy moreover the transcriptional analysis
51
 of balf and pb mononuclear cells from covid19 patients revealed that high levels of cxcl2 and cxcl8 may contribute to the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection further aggravating the pulmonary inflammatory response given these findings netosis may represent a viable therapeutic target for inhibiting crs and organ damage other important areas in neutrophil response such as interactions with humoral the role of iga and cd89 igg and cd16 etc or myeloid subsets remain unstudieddata on the nk cell response in covid19 is limited in sars nk cells were found to be useful in predicting disease severity and cd158b nk cells were associated with the presence of antisarscovspecific antibodies
66
 
67
 similarly a recent study showed that the number of nk cells in pb was decreased in patients infected with sarscov2 especially in severe cases
68
 but a separate report showed no difference in the number of cd16cd56 nk cells in mild vs severe cases
69
 therefore whether nk cells could be a predictor of covid19 remains to be determined additional studies are needed to determine whether nk cells can impact viral control ie directly or through adccmediated mechanisms or contribute to cytokine release during the disease course of covid19despite the role of dendritic cells and  t cells in respiratory infections
70
 
71
 there is currently no available evidence to show a link between sarscov2 infection and the modulation of myeloid or plasmacytoid dendritic cells nor reports of how  t cells may impact the disease
72

t cell subsets change as covid19 infection progresses from mild to severe a singlecell sequencing study found target inflammatory genes were highly expressed by cd4 t cells and cd8 ctls underwent clonal expansion in the recovery stage of covid19 patients
47
 however in patients advancing to severe disease the number of t lymphocytes remained low as compared with mildstage patients with the levels of helper t cell subsets including th1 th2 and th17 at belownormal levels
68
 indeed numerous clinical reports show that the decreased frequency of circulating lymphocytes including cd4 and cd8 t cells is closely related to disease severity of covid19
75
 
76
 wang et al
77
 found that elevated il6 levels occurred 12 d prior to decreases in cd8 and cd4 t cells liu et al
78
 observed that cd4 and cd8 t cell levels dropped to their lowest levels after 4 to 6 d of illness whereas il10 il2 tnf and other cytokines reached peak levels these studies suggest a negative relationship between high levels of cytokines eg il6 il10 il2 tnf and lower circulating t cells in severe patients infected by sarscov2 likely because of redistribution of cells in tissue andor activation of induced cell death
79
 sarscov2 infection might induce lymphocyte apoptosis by enhancing the p53 signaling pathway or the fas signaling pathway
42
 
51
 a decrease in circulating lymphocytes as a result of tissue redistribution is consistent with the development of interstitial pneumonitis which is caused by mononuclear cell infiltration in severe casesweiskopf et al
80
 reported that sarscov2specific cd4 and cd8 t cells were detected in the pb of covid19 patients with ards at 14 d after the onset of symptoms furthermore antigenspecific central and effector memory responses were detected in virusspecific cd4 t cells and cd8 t cells of ards patients respectively with regard to cytokine secretion they proposed that in cases of severe disease the cd8 cytotoxic t cells predominantly secrete ifn whereas virusspecific cd4 t cells secrete expected levels of th1 ifn tnf and il2 and th2 il5 il9 and il10 cytokines in addition zheng et al
81
 reported that the proportion of multifunctional cd4 t cells ifn tnf and il2 with more than two positive cytokines among them was reduced in severe covid19 patients when compared to those with mild or no infection as multifunctional t cells are associated with better outcomes after vaccination
82
 a decrease in multifunctional cd4 t cells might infer a poor clinical outcome in patients with severe covid19 in covid19 patients with ards a decrease in cd4 and cd8 t cells was associated with an increase in cd38 cd8 394 hladr cd4 347 t cells
32
 zheng et al
81
 and chen et al
83
 further reported that cd8 t cells in the pb of covid19 patients exhibited an overactivated phenotype which is indicative of a sustained adaptive immune response whether effective or not in addition to an innate immune response of interest activated cd8 t cell responses appear to be ineffective as patients advance to severe stages of disease as evidenced by the exhaustive phenotype of cd8 t cells hladrtigitcd8 t cells
81
 consistent with an onset of t cell exhaustion chen et al
83
 found that t cells in the pb of severe covid19 patients expressed high levels of pd1 and tim3 the expression levels of pd1 and tim3 on t cells also was positively correlated with disease severityactivated t cells could also add fuel to the cytokine storm by further stimulating inflammatory responses from innate immune cells for example it was shown that the expression of il1 csf1 and csf2 on t cells may bind to the il1r and colony stimulating factor receptor csfr expressed on monocytes and further stimulate the activation of monocytes
47
 th1 cells in patients with severe covid19 were reported to stimulate the production of il6 by inflammatory monocytes
39
 which together with th17 cells
84
 may directly join innate immune cells in sparking the release of proinflammatory cytokines further contributing to the cytokine storm and subsequent organ damage
47
 
84

regulatory t cells tregs play a critical role in dampening an excessive inflammatory response as well as in antiviral immune responses
85
 therefore tregs may be central to maintaining a balance between antiviral immunity and the harmful cytokine storm to date the reports regarding the treg cells in covid19 patients remain inconsistent some studies found upregulated treg cells in severe illness whereas others reported that the number of tregs was reduced or unchanged in covid19 patients
68
 
77
 
86
 therefore the role of treg cells in the pathogenesis of covid19 needs to be further clarifiedcirculating b cells appear to be restored to normal levels in patients upon recovery from covid19 and convalescent plasma cp infusion further discussed later has been shown to be a potentially effective treatment as reported in 6 severe covid19 patients
87
 these findings support the hypothesis that humoral immune responses that boost sarscov2specific antibodies are important in the hosts resolution of sarscov2 infection and likely would help protect against reinfection
51
 
88
 
89
 of interest this ability to develop neutralizing antibody production and memory after infection may not be the same in all recovered patients recent data suggests that as many as 30 of recovered patients who had a milder disease course may develop low titers of neutralizing antibodies which may convey a higher risk for reinfection
90
 indeed several studies have detected higher antibody titers after recovery from more severe disease when compared with milder cases ie higher antibody titer in recovered elderly patients as compared with younger patients that often have mild or asymptomatic disease this suggests a disease course with a stronger immune response may also lead to greater protection against reinfection
90
 
91
 it is important to note that binding antibodies can also play a role in antibodymediated phagocytosis and antibodydependent cytotoxicity it remains to be determined if patients with low total or neutralizing antibody titers will have higher reinfection ratessimilar to cd4 t cd8 t cells and nk cells b cells were also markedly decreased in severe covid19 patients as compared with mild patients and the counts of b lymphocytes were negatively associated with viral burden
51
 aside from protection it also remains undetermined if prior exposure may prime the bodys response leading to antibodydependent enhancement ade effects for greater infection or an amplification of inflammation cascades previously ade had been reported in other viral infections such as sarscov thus ade if present may hinder the hosts ability to manage inflammation in lung and other tissues
52
 an analysis of 173 covid19 patients analyzed for sarscov2specific igm and iggs found that those with severe or critical disease had a high titer of total antibodies as well as a high igg response which were associated with a poor outcome and prognosis
92
 whether the increase in antibody titers during disease represents a secondary outcome of the hosts response to high viral titers or whether an ade mechanism could contribute to a sudden rise in viral load and onset of a cytokine storm remains undeterminedmany proinflammation cytokines such as il6 tnf il1 il2 il17 ifn gcsf mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 ip10 ifninduced protein 10 and others were found to be significantly elevated in severe covid19 patients table 1 and fig 1 a profile that is similar to that found in patients with sars and mers
36
 
93
 
94

as shown in table 1 the elevation of il6 was most frequently measured and detected in severe cases of sarscov2 infection zhou et al
39
 reported that the pathogenic gmcsfproducing th1 cells in severe covid19 patients induced il6 production from cd14cd16 monocytes and thus accelerated the inflammation associated with a cytokine storm elevated levels of il6 also were found in patients with exacerbating disease progression as evidenced by chest ct
95
 moreover chen et al
96
 reported that the serum sarscov2 viral load was closely associated with il6 levels in critical patients r  0902 high levels of il6 may also contribute to an increase in neutrophil cells and decrease in lymphocytes clearly il6 may impact the development of ards in covid19 patients
97
 and a rise in il6 may be a useful marker for severe disease onset furthermore as lungcentric coagulopathy can also play an important role in the pathophysiology in the severe covid19 patients
98
 il6 may contribute to this pathology by inducing coagulation cascades
99
 however hypercoagulability together with high levels of ddimers fibrinogen and crp in covid19 patients is distinct from the disseminated intravascular coagulation described in more severe inflammatory conditions
100
 
101
 further the levels of il6 can vary in covid19 patients relative to severity of disease
11
 
102
 it was recently shown that treatment with tocilizumab an antibody that blocks the il6 receptor resulted in poor outcomes in covid19 patients and did not prevent progression to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
103
 this suggests that il6 may be a major indicator but not the sole driver in the pathology of disease it is possible too that the stage of disease may impact the benefit of il6 blockage therapytnf is a master proinflammatory cytokine that is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis ra consequently antitnf biologics have become a firstline treatment for such diseases
104
 high levels of tnf often are produced in the initial response to infectious disease
105
 a recent study shows that the level of tnf 60130 pgml was higher than that of il6 1050 pgml in the plasma of severe covid19 patients
14
 therefore further investigation is warranted to define how tnf impacts immunopathology as well as the effectiveness of antitnf therapy in severe covid19 patientsin addition to examining il6 and tnf yang et al
93
 studied 48 cytokines in the pb from covid19 patients 14 of which were markedly increased among these 14 cytokines ip10 mcp3 and il1ra were identified as biomarkers for severity and fatal outcomes of disease they also found that the level of ip10 was markedly higher in patients with severe compared with mild disease a report from 10 covid19 patients with severe disease showed a marked elevation of ccl5 cc chemokine ligand 5 rantes importantly treatment with ccr5blocking antibody resulted in decreased il6 blood levels lower ifnrelated gene expression reduced sarscov2 viral load and a restoration of the immune homeostasis
106
 liu et al
107
 reported that 38 cytokines in the pb of covid19 patients were significantly increased and 15 cytokines il12 il1ra ip10 pdgfbb plateletderived growth factorbb tnf ifn mcsf macrophage csf il17 hgf gcsf il2 il4 il10 il1 and il7 were associated with severity of disease in addition some inflammatory markers such as crp and ddimer were also markedly elevated
102
 however unlike findings in sars patients
108
 covid19 patients showed increases in antiinflammatory cytokines such as il10 and il4
74
 indicative of an increased th2 response and subsequent pulmonary interstitial fibrosis last the results of singlecell rna sequence of early recovery patients infected with sarscov2 showed that il1 and mcsf may be novel mediators in the inflammatory response associated with a cytokine storm
47
 
77

a th17type cytokine storm caused by a mobilization of th17 responses has also been observed in both sars and mers patients
109
 
110
 it was reported that a high number of ccr4 ccr6 th17 cells which at least partially attributed to this immunopathology was also present in covid19 patient with ards
84
 markedly elevated cytokines ie il1 il17 tnf and gmcsf in covid19 patients have been associated with th17 responses
107
 these findings suggest that the th17type cytokine storm may lead or be associated with the onset of organ damage commonly observed in severe covid19 patients
84

taken together staging of sarscov2 infection are commonly divided into four stages mildcommonseverecritical all of which may have different magnitudes of cytokine release it is also possible that the qualitative features of the cytokine storm between disease stages may point to distinct host or pathogen triggers eg cytokine storm with or without concomitant bacterial pneumonia figure 2 summarizes the combined contribution of blood and lung tissue infiltrates and shows how added factors such as an accompanying bacterial pneumonia may exacerbate cytokine responsesclinical reports showing that elevated levels of il6 are associated with the immunopathology and disease severity of covid19
111
 have provided a strong scientific rationale for examining the effects of il6 or its receptor antagonists eg siltuximab and clazakizumab or sarilumab and tocilizumab in fact tocilizumab has been recommended in china to treat covid19 patients with bilateral pulmonary damage and severe symptoms
112
 early clinical reports of tocilizumab showed that fevers subsided in 20 severe patients within 1 d after the treatment and 95 of these patients achieved recovery sufficient to allow them to be released from the hospital within 2 wk
113
 guo et al
114
 showed that tocilizumab treatment 400 mg once through an iv drip
115
 attenuated overactivated inflammatory immune responses and boosted antivirus immune responses mediated by b cells and cd8 t cells furthermore luo et al
116
 recommended that tocilizumab be given repeatedly in low doses 80240 mg per time for maximal benefit taken together therapy to block il6 remains the most prevalent anticytokine treatment under investigation by contrast there are no registered studies in the chinese clinical trials register chictr to test the effect of il1 inhibitors for the treatment of covid19 although il6 is an attractive therapy target blocking il6 may not be beneficial in all patients as noted above treatment with tocilizumab can result in the onset of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in covid19 patients
103
 similar to antiil6 the effect of antagonists against other inflammatory cytokines in attenuating a cytokine storm is under investigation as of may 6 2020 a total of 49 clinical trials targeting cytokine inhibition were registered in the chictr and the national institutes of healths clinical research trials table 2 in addition to antiil6 strategies antagonistic antibodies directed against ifn il1 il1r tnf il8 gmcsf gmcsf receptor il17a and ccr5 are also under evaluation for their effect on the cytokine storm or in mediating excessive immune activation table 2 other approaches to suppress proinflammatory cytokine in covid19 patients have also been proposed for example given il37s ability to inhibit il1 il6 tnf and ccl2 conti and colleagues hypothesized that il37 may be useful in the treatment of covid19 patients with crs
117
 in another study the ccl5ccr5 axis was found to contribute to immunopathology
106
 in critically ill covid19 patients with elevated levels of ccl5 rantes as compared with patients who had mild or moderate cases of disease blocking the ccr5 antibody with leronlimab reduced il6 levels in critically ill covid19 patients and restored the cd4cd8 ratio leading to a marked reduction in sarscov2 plasma viremia
106
 deng and colleagues have also suggested that upstream targets such as cyclic guanosine monophosphate gmp  adenosine monophosphate amp synthase cgas anaplastic lymphoma kinase alk and stimulator of interferon genes sting may help reduce cell activation and cytokine release
118
 likewise jakstat signaling inhibitors baricitinib and ruxolitinib have also been proposed for preventing crs
119
 table 2 apart from anticytokine treatment cytokine therapy with ifn2b was reported by huazhong university of science and technology wuhan china where treated patients saw reductions in their levels of il6 as well as a shorter duration in viral shedding
54
 ifnbeta1b has also been noted as beneficial when added to antiviral regimen that includes lopinavir and ritonavir
120

mscs are adult stem cells that have the ability to selfreplicate and which show potential for differentiation into multiple cell types
121
 mscs have the potential to impact antiinflammatory activities by producing immunosuppressive cytokines and by directly interacting with and inhibiting the activation of immune cells
121
 leng et al
88
 reported that 7 covid19 patients in beijing youan hospital beijing china were given mscs chictr2000029990 in this report 14 d after transplantation with mscs patients showed an increase in peripheral lymphocytes and cd14cd11ccd11bmid regulatory dc cells accompanied by an increase in il10 and a decrease in tnf those patients also saw a decrease in cytokineproducing cxcr3cd4 t cells cxcr3cd8 t cells and cxcr3 nk cells as of may 6 2020 a total of 40 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of mscs transplantation in the treatment of covid19 patients have been registered in chictr and nih table 2 and supporting information table s1cp transfusion has been recommended for the treatment of patients experiencing a sudden disease progression and those with critical and severe disease according to the guidelines of diagnosis and treatment of covid19 7th ed china
112
 it was previously shown that cp treatment could reduce the levels of cytokines in patients with severe influenza
122
 yang et al
73
 reported that the viremia of 10 covid19 patients was controlled and the lymphocyte counts increased after 7 d of cp transfusion similar beneficial effects also were reported in 6 severe covid19 patients
87
 however results from patients receiving cp remain limited as questions remain related to the optimal dose and best therapeutic window for administering cp for example patients in the early phases of infection have not been studied in addition cp often is combined with other treatments making it difficult to conclusively evaluate the true benefit of cp alone
119
 importantly the question of whether harmful ade could be induced by cp therapy remains under study
119
 directly removing cytokines and other toxins through blood purification using continuous renal replacement therapy hemoadsorption hemoperfusion and blood exchange have also been proposed as a way of containing the cytokine storm luo et al
123
 reported findings from three patients treated with plasma exchange in the first affiliated hospital of bengbu medical college bengbu china their results showed that the level of il6 was decreased and lymphocyte count increased after treatment current clinical trials testing the therapeutic effect of cp and blood purification are summarized in table 2 and supporting information table s2cq or hcq have been proposed as antiviral agents in the treatment of both mild and severe cases of covid19
124
 these compounds increase the ph of endosomes which may reduce sarscov2 infection by inhibiting cathepsin l an enzyme that is vital for cleavage of the viral spike protein
125
 leading to viral entry cq or hcq also have the antiinflammatory effects regulating myeloid activity by limiting its impact on endocytic tlr receptors tlr 3 7 9 and reducing peptide binding on mhc class ii proteins
126
 
127
 use of cq or hcq as treatment for covid19 has commonly been joined with azithromycin to prevent bacterial infections azithromycin also is often used clinically to dampen lung inflammation in other conditions such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease providing added rationale for its use in covid19
128
 gautret et al
129
 treated covid19 patients n  20 with 600 mg of hcq daily with some patients n  6 also receiving concurrent azithromycin depending on their clinical manifestation results support the finding that hcq treatment can reduce viral load and its effect might be reinforced by concurrent use of azithromycin which as noted above could be the result of the antibiotics immunomodulatory effect as seen with other respiratory diseases lu et al n  13
130
 and zhang et al n  31
131
 registered number nct04261517 and chictr2000029559 shown in supporting information table s3 also reported that early treatment with hcq showed better outcomes negative covid19 nucleic acid of throat swabs shorter time to clinical recovery or shorter cough remission time in a retrospective study from yu et al
132
 hcq reduced the level of il6 and decreased mortality of critical covid19 patients n  48 suggesting that hcq could be an effective treatment in critical covid19 patientsof note it is still unknown if hcq has differing effects on cytokine and leukocyte levels when it is administered at different stages of disease therefore the effect of hcq on the immunopathology of crs in covid19 patients has yet to be determined likewise the therapeutic benefit of hcq has been challenged by data showing that longterm use of hcq in systemic lupus erythematosus sle patients did not prevent the onset of severe covid19 in a subset of sle patients n  17
133
 furthermore high cq doses 600 mg used in severe cases may lead to arrhythmias and cardiac complications
134
 although anecdotal reports suggest that cq or hcq may possess better efficacy in the treatment of early covid19 to date limited clinical studies have been published whether the efficacy of hcq is different in patients with varying degrees of severity and whether its clinical benefit if confirmed is because the drug limits immune responses ie preventing a cytokine storm or because it directly inhibits viral infection has not been fully explored so far a total of 83 clinical trials testing the preventative or therapeutic effects of hcq or cq on covid19 have now been registered table 2 and supporting information table s3according to the guidelines of diagnosis and treatment of covid19 7th ed china tcm is recommended in the management and treatment of covid19 patients in china inspired by the purported efficacy of tcm in the treatment of sars more than 85 of patients in different stages of covid19 in china were treated with a variety of tcm herbal medicines see yang et al
135
 tcm strategies selected for covid19 were selected based on their immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory properties as determined by their use in clinics
136
 
137
 
138
 
139
 
140
 
141
 
142
 there also is evidence that the immunosuppressive features of tcm may convey beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of a cytokine storm
114
 a retrospective study reported that matrine and sodium chloride injection could markedly improve lymphopenia in covid19 patients possibly by inhibiting pulmonary inflammatory cytokines
143
 
144
 in an in vitro experiment zhu et al
145
 found that liquiritin could markedly inhibit replication of sarscov2 by mimicking type i ifn ma xing shi gan decoction mxsgd is a multiple component tcm preparation recommended by the guidelines for use in china findings from a network pharmacologic study and kegg enrichment analysis indicate that mxsgd has a number of beneficial effects including inhibiting cytokine storm
39
 to identify additional tcm with the capacity to inhibit cytokine storm in covid19 patients ren and colleagues
146
 screened the tcm database 2009 tcmd 2009 they searched for compounds that impacted the arachidonic acid aa metabolic pathway because it is essential for the synthesis of cytokines their study revealed magnolignan i lonicerin and physcion8odglucopyranoside were the most potent aa inhibitors and consequently suggested that herbal medicines which included these agents might be most useful in dampening a cytokine storm in patients
146
 we anticipate additional tcm strategies will be identified for the management of cytokine storm in covid19 patients for example ulinastatin a natural antiinflammatory substance from fresh human urine is believed to inhibit cytokine release and subsequent tissue injury
147
 and is currently under investigation as a treatment of covid19 patients
148

in addition to tcm corticosteroid treatment has been shown to dampen the inflammatory cascade from a cytokine storm
149
 a recent study found that early and shortterm administration of methylprednisolone could improve the clinical outcome in moderatetosevere covid19 patients
150
 although useful in critical patients as a tool for managing host inflammatory responses corticosteroids are not recommended in high doses nor for prolonged periods of time as they may dampen normal immune responses that could help contain the viral infection
146
 
151
 
152
 nevertheless there are a number of ongoing clinical trials table 2 and supporting information table s4 that may show if and when safe and beneficial corticosteroidbased treatment is indicated for treating in covid19last several immunomodulatory therapies including recombinant human ifnalpha rhgcsf iv immunoglobulin antibody vaccine nutritional supplements zinc vitamin c and vitamin d3 colchicine and cellular therapy are also under investigation for inhibiting a cytokine storm table 2 and supporting information table s4it is generally believed that the cytokine storm triggered by sarscov2 infection is a central mediator for the lung injury and resulting ards found in cases of severe or critical covid19 patients we present several leukocyte and cytokine changes that may help define the progression of covid19 from an initial to a late stage in both mild and severe cases however more needs to be learned regarding how elevations in specific cytokines combinations using standardized methods and defined ranges could be used to describe each stage of the inflammatory response as the disease progresses apart from commonly used surrogates of disease progression ddimer crp ferritin and procalcitonin levels with emphasis on ddimer and ferritin cytokinebased biomarkers still lack consensus on cutoff values for assessing disease progression other than a pattern of a rise with severity disease staging with an integration of cellular neutrophilia decreases in lymphocytes etc soluble plasma markers ddimer etc together with cytokine changes also remains to be pursued based on currently reported clinical data to date priority could be placed on combining elevations of il6 tnf il1 ip10 ddimer and ferritin with changes in circulating and activation states of myeloid neutrophil and t cell responses which together could provide improved biomarkers for progression to crs and severe covid19 patients although age combined comorbidities cardiovascular disease diabetes etc and bacterial infection have also emerged as risk factors for severe disease
153
 
154
 
155
 it remains unclear how each of these conditions changes the immunoregulatory cascade characteristics of the cytokine storm coagulopathy and other inflammatory outcomes defining shared or populationspecific triggers and amplifiers of a cytokine storm at specific disease stages will advance novel precision medicine strategiesother factors known to contribute to disease pathogenesis such as host genetics and epigenetics microbiome mucosal infection apart from lung immunoregulatory networks aging cooccurring disease exosomes complement neurologic endocrine and polydrug environments etc have yet to be fully investigated for example fogarty et al
98
 reported a potential 34fold higher thrombotic risk in caucasians which underscores the potential impact that race and ethnicity may have on disease outcomes although coagulopathy seems to be a severe complication in covid19 infection it may not necessarily be related to disease severity or exclusively present during or after a cytokine storm
156
 it remains undetermined how the onset of coagulopathy in the absence of compromised lung capacity ventilationperfusion or crs may be related to early press reports of higher stroke incidence in young and middleaged infected patients in the united states indeed it has been proposed that in predisposed individuals alveolar viral damage may trigger an underlying inflammatory reaction promoting a microvascular pulmonary thrombosis or endothelial thromboinflammatory syndrome affecting microvascular beds beyond the lung eg brain and other vital organs
157
 how immune factors identified in this review eg netosis il6 macrophage activation antibody response etc may contribute to damage to microvascular beds or how this damage predisposes incidence of a crs remains to be determined therefore there is a need to identify leading molecular triggers of multiorgan failure after a cytokine storm in order to prevent added lethal outcomesregarding therapy the timing and the best ways to combine various treatments also remains to be determined eg early antiviral therapy followed by anticrs therapy when that occurs
158
 there is also a need to extend immunopathogenesis studies beyond adults based on studies of covid19 clinical features in pregnancy it is known that neonates can be different from adults
159
 
160
 for example children rarely progress with a disease course requiring icu care regrettably the limited clinical trial activity focusing on children remains a missed opportunity to better address how to treat and limit transmission in this group
161

greater advances in all of these areas will allow for selective treatments both to target key pathogenic components of the cytokine storm and further advance highly targeted precision medicine strategiesjw mj xc and ljm wrote manuscript and designed figures jw and mj contributed equally to this workthe authors declare no conflicts of interestthere is a growing recognition that coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 possesses neurotropic properties and can lead to neurological manifestations similar to sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers covid-19 is envisaged to have enduring cognitive psychological and psychiatric consequences however data pertaining to this are albeit limited there is a growing anticipation that covid-19 might cause delirium depression anxiety fatigue and post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd rogers et al 2020 a recent report suggests immediate psychological distress especially higher levels of depression anxiety and ptsd symptoms in quarantined patients with covid-19 guo et al 2020 as observed in sars survivors covid-19 survivors may also have long-term psychiatric morbidities mak et al 2009various mechanisms are being proposed to contribute to the neurobiological sequelae of covid-19 sars-cov-2 can transmigrate to brain by disrupting blood brain barrier bbb and interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor expressed by brain tissue the ace2 receptor has pleotropic roles in the stress response system and mood regulation vian et al 2017 sars-cov-2 could affect the brain and behavior of people by causing i direct neuronal damage ii immune injury and iii hypoxia and biogenesis contextually these mechanisms have consistently been implicated in the pathogenetic pathways of many psychiatric disorders however one pertinent question arises how covid-19 associated immune changes will influence the risk progression and outcomes of psychiatric conditionsthe genesis of a cytokine storm is evident in both infectious and non-infections disease states occurring throughout the body including brain it was used to describe the underlying mechanisms of multiple infectious diseases such as variola virus severe influenza h1n1 h5n1 and sars the cns is particularly vulnerable to cytokine storms as most of the cytokines involved in cytokine storm are either produced within the brain or reach brain from periphery especially in the context of disrupted bbb permeability morris et al 2018 notably the cytokine storm appears to drive chronic neurotoxic and neurodegenerative processes in conditions like post-traumatic brain injury post-stroke and alzheimers disease multiple sclerosis a classical example neuroinflammatory disorder of the cns is suggested to be associated with cytokine storm link 1998 the acute spike in circulating inflammatory moieties has also been associated with post-operative cognitive decline skvarc et al 2018evidence of the cns impact of a cytokine storm in infectious diseases are relatively sparse acute necrotizing encephalopathy ane is the most severe type of influenza-associated encephalopathy and a rare complication of influenza this has been associated with intracranial cytokine storms there is a significant lack of information whether cytokine storm leads to neuroinflammation in individuals with covid-19 infection interestingly a study based on ct and mri features for the first time reports the presence of covid-19 associated acute necrotizing encephalopathy indicating a potential consequence of a cns cytokine storm in patients with covid-19 infection poyiadji et al 2020immunopathogenesis is one of the predominant etiological models of major psychiatric disorders activation of immune-inflammatory pathways both peripherally and in the brain has been linked with the genesis and progression of neuropsychiatric disorders it is noteworthy that most of the neuropsychiatric conditions have consistently been linked to chronic low-grade inflammation this implies a sustained low-level inflammation throughout the body systemic inflammation causing neuroinflammation is a well-documented factthe notion that cytokine storm can lead to neuropsychiatric disorders has not been comprehensively tested so far most of the cytokines involved in a cytokine storm are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder indirect evidence indicates that a cytokine storm could be involved in driving the manifestation of psychiatric symptoms influenza infections have been shown to result into cytokine storm besides this sars and mers also lead to cytokine storm contextually influenza infections sars and mers are shown to be associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms based on this understanding a neurobiological consequences of cytokine storm seems highly likely in neuropsychiatric conditionsthere is a concern whether patients with psychiatric conditions will experience more psychiatric symptoms during covid-19 pandemic a recent study reports that covid-19 has severe negative psychological impact in patients with pre-existing psychiatric conditions and these patients displayed higher risk of developing symptoms of ptsd depression anxiety stress and insomnia hao et al 2020 these patients with sars-cov-2 infection mostly exhibit a cytokine storm does this mean that patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders experience a higher risk of psychiatric episodes due to dramatic increase of inflammatory response elicited by cytokine storm through there is a significant lack of data towards this notion this seems to be a possibility support towards this derives from studies showing coronavirus immunoreactivity based on the measures of antibody levels and seroprevalence of certain coronavirus strains in patients with recent onset psychotic symptoms severance et al 2011 a study examining correlation between psychological distress and peripheral inflammation demonstrated positive correlation between the levels of depression and levels of c-reactive protein crp among patients covid-19 quarantined patients with depression symptoms guo et al 2020 sars-cov-2 triggering new neuropsychiatric conditions were shown to be accompanied by elevated crp levelswe propose that sars-cov-2 associated immediate or new-onset neuropsychiatric manifestations are likely immune-mediated the presence of a cytokine storm involved in the severity and mortality of covid-19 appears to escalate psychiatric manifestations this also seems to exert deleterious effects on multiple organs and systems and lead to long-lasting changes in brain and behaviour the long-standing theory that chronic low-grade inflammation lead to psychiatric diseases may not constitute the full picture of the underlying pathway of immediate psychological distress it is therefore assumed that the classical concept of chronic low-grade inflammation in psychosis may require a revision and may well be augmented by the cytokine storm modelmost people suffering from covid-19 recover without experiencing severe neuropsychiatric conditions with short-term delirium as the most common neuropsychiatric symptom people with pre-existing neuropsychiatric conditions might have a reduced incidence of sars-cov-2 or might be protected from covid-19 this could be explained in the light of chronic-low grade inflammation which is already present in individuals with pre-existing neuropsychiatric conditions the on-going chronic low-grade inflammation could potentially make an individual with pre-existing neuropsychiatric condition less vulnerable to covid-19 or if the person with pre-existing mental illness develops covid-19 the on-going chronic low-grade inflammation might be involved in moderating the covid-19 associated cytokine storm the other alternative underlying mechanism might be a disrupted inflammatory response system irs and compensatory immune-regulatory system cirs recently functional implications of irs-cirs axis have been highlighted in various neuropsychiatric disorders noto et al 2019 infections are known to activate the irs and the activated irs induces the cirs which exerts negative feedback through production of anti-inflammatory cytokines those individuals with pre-existing mental illness and an activated irs could be more prone to covid-19 however an over-active cirs pathway as proposed in patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder maes and carvalho 2018 might provide protection against the consequences of covid-19 infection including cytokine storm and increased oxidative stress although in some cases an overzealous cirs response could induce immunoparalysis thereby increasing morbidity or mortality though these aspects are based on hypothetical assumptions such possibilities cannot be ruled out these factors will remain as challenge to the clinicians in diagnosing and treating patients with psychiatric conditions with a history of covid-19 post covid-19 immunopsychiatry may increasingly take centre stage in psychiatrynoneas of mid-april 2020 severe

cytokine storm syndrome is an umbrella term describing various frequently fatal hyperinflammatory conditions such as macrophage activation syndrome haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytois and cytokine release syndrome2 there are many associated diseases eg lupus and lymphoma and triggers eg dengue and car t-cell therapy that can result in cytokine storm syndrome viral infections including pandemic influenza strains are common triggers and sars-cov-2 can be added to the list there are several pathophysiological pathways that can result in cytokine storm syndrome but the best studied pathway is defective lymphocyte killing via the perforin pathway homozygous defects in perforin pathway genes cause familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and heterozygous mutations in these same genes are associated with secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis including fatal h1n1 influenza3 whether similar or novel genetic defects contribute to the severity of covid-19-associated cytokine storm syndrome is unknown but should be answered by genomic sequencing of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19-associated cytokine storm syndromeregardless of mechanism cytokine storm syndromes share features of inappropriately elevated proinflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 and interferon- produced by a dysregulated host immune response resulting in multiorgan failure all cytokine storm syndromes are not identical and covid-19-associated cytokine storm syndrome has some unique features including propensity for early acute respiratory distress syndrome and clotting while having higher serum ferritins and lower il-6 concentration than routinely noted in other cytokine storm syndromes1 2 nonetheless covid-19 triggers a hyperinflammatory response in a substantial number of patients who require hospital admission different therapies have been used over the years for treatment of various cytokine storm syndromes these therapies include broadly immunosuppressive approaches eg glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors and targeted immunomodulatory therapies eg anticytokines and janus kinase inhibitors1 2 on the basis of previous experience with other deadly coronaviruses severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and middle east respiratory distress syndrome who has recommended against glucocorticoid treatment of patients with covid-19 however targeting of cytokines in other cytokine storm syndromes has proved to be effective and is attractive because of the lower frequencies of associated side-effects thus anticytokine approaches are being explored for treating covid-19-associated cytokine storm syndromeas il-6 is easily measured and therapies targeting il-6 are available in china early approaches to treating covid-19-associated cytokine storm syndrome involved il-6 blockade there are now dozens of clinical trials studying blockade of il-6 or its receptor and early publications of trials and non-trial cohorts are reporting mixed results nevertheless there is evidence that blocking il-6 signalling might benefit some patients with covid-194 il-1 is another pro-inflammatory cytokine targeted to treat various cytokine storm syndromes il-1 blockade with anakinra a recombinant human il-1 receptor antagonist notably improved survival in a subset of patients with sepsis and features of cytokine storm syndrome and was otherwise safe in this setting5 there are currently about a dozen clinical trials exploring il-1 blockade for covid-19-associated cytokine storm syndromewhile awaiting results of these clinical trials case series of anakinra treating covid-19-associated cytokine storm syndrome are being published three small cases series reported anakinra benefitting patients with covid-196 7 8 now in the lancet rheumatology thomas huet and colleagues9 describe a larger prospective single-centre cohort study with a historical control cohort demonstrating that anakinra significantly reduced requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation and death in patients who received anakinra n52 compared with historical controls who received usual care n44 hazard ratio 022 95 ci 011041 p00001 patients who were admitted to hospital were consecutively enrolled on the basis of having laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 bilateral lung infiltrates on imaging and critical pulmonary function before admission to the intensive care unit admission to an icu or death occurred in 13 25 of 52 patients in the anakinra group compared with 32 73 of 44 patients in the historical control group the investigators also demonstrated a significant reduction in oxygen requirement from a median of 7 lmin iqr 69 to 2 lmin 04 within a week of starting anakinra therapy there was an associated decrease in crp concentration in the anakinra group compared with the historical control group within 4 days of starting anakinra therapy p00001 the study has potential biases as do all non-randomised non-blinded studies but multivariate analysis was used to control for potentially confounding factors such as body-mass index without change in conclusions other than seven patients in the anakinra group and four patients in the control group with elevated liver enzymes there were no substantial side-effects this study is the most definitive evidence to date that anakinra can benefit patients with covid-19-associated cytokine storm syndrome the significant reduction in mortality associated with anakinra use for covid-19 in this study is encouraging in these challenging timesthe choice of anakinra to treat deadly cytokine storms is wise because it has a remarkable benefit-to-side-effect ratio it is a recombinant human protein that binds to both il-1 and il-1 with a half-life of about 4 h has a large therapeutic window 148 mgkg per day can be given intravenously or subcutaneously has a well established favourable safety profile and works quickly and effectively for various cytokine storm syndromes10 a top priority in this pandemic is to learn effective therapy from clinical trial enrolment however it is difficult for health-care professionals in regions overwhelmed by covid-19 to witness so much death although it is important to treat the virus of infected patients as best we can if a cytokine storm syndrome is present then that also must be managed to reduce mortality from an excessive host immune response awaiting controlled trial results anakinra provides hope for those severely affected by covid-19

since december 2019 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has broken out in wuhan china and has spread rapidly in most countries of the world recently a cell surface protein known as angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 has been identified to be involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis for sars-cov-2 entry to the cells
1
 the team of nanshan zhong found that 879 patients had fever after hospitalization and 157 patients developed to severe pneumonia 2 in this outbreak of covid-19 some infected patients would suddenly worsen and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and then shock tissue perfusion disorders in the later stage eventually die from multiple organ failure and the aggravation was mainly caused by cytokine storm 3 4 that was described in detail in our last review 5 therefore how to block the cytokine storm and when to initiate anti-inflammation therapy is critical for reducing death rate of covid-19 the clinically severe phase of covid-19 is accompanied by high levels of cytokine signalling all of which signal through the janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription jak-stat pathway baricitinib is not only expected to interrupt the passage and intracellular assembly of sars-cov-2 into the target cells mediated by ace2 receptor but also promises to be a specific drug that blocks cytokine storms by suppressing jak1jak2 6 however the clinical experience and data of baricitinib in the treatment of covid-19 are limited and the mechanism of drug action applicable patients and risks of the drug need to be recognized in this paper we will elaborate the role of cytokine storm mediated by jak-stat pathway in severe covid-19 the possible mechanisms of baricitinib blocking sars-cov-2 entry into the target cells and controlling the cytokine storm the key points of pharmaceutical care based on the latest research reports clinical trial progress and drug instruction from the us fda so as to provide reference for the treatment of covid-19cytokines a group of small proteins secreted by stromal cells and immune system cells used mainly for inter-cell signaling and communication and have a variety of biological functions such as regulating innate immunity adaptive immunity hematopoiesis cell growth and differentiation and repairing damaged tissues by binding to receptors cytokines mainly include interleukin il interferon ifn tumor necrosis factor tnf colony stimulating factor csf chemokine and growth factor when the human body is invaded by bacteria and viruses the immune system will release a large number of cytokines 7 8 excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines contributes to cytokine storm in this outbreak of covid-19 some infected patients would suddenly worsen in the later stage and eventually die from multiple organ failure and the aggravation was mainly caused by cytokine storm 4 these pathological mechanisms may be closely relevant to the death of covid-19 patients 9 a number of recently researches have analyzed the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients and consistently found that the lymphocyte count was significantly reduced in patients with pneumonia especially those with severe pneumonia while numerous cytokines such as il-1 il-2 il- 6 il-8 il-10 tnf- and ifn- were significantly increased which was the main cause of the cytokine storm especially il-6 9 10 11 12 13 previous therapy for controlling cytokine storm with large doses of glucocorticoid may delay the clearance of coronavirus and cause complications of glucocorticoid therapy in addition to clinical trials glucocorticoids should not be used to treat lung injury or shock caused by covid-1914jak are a group of cytoplasmic enzymes with tyrosine kinase activity that facilitate the transmission of signals from the cell surface to its interior which are extremely important in pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated signaling process stat one of the most crucial cytokine-activated transcription factors in the process of immune response is phosphorylated by jak dimerized and then transports into the nucleus through the nuclear membrane to regulate the expression of related genes this pathway is so called jak-stat signaling pathway that promotes the cytokine storm mediated by excessive amounts of cytokine in a simple and efficient way 15 there are 4 jak members jak1 jak2 jak3 and tyk2 and 7 stat members stat1 stat2 stat3 stat4 stat5a stat5b and stat616 17 jak1 jak2 and tyk2 are expressed indiscriminately throughout the body whereas jak3 is expressed in the haematopoietic cells 18 activation of the jak-stat pathway is induced by cytokine binding to surface receptors and culminates in regulation of transcription by stats various cytokines and growth factors transmit signals through the jak-stat signaling pathway including il-27 gm-csf epidermal growth factor egf platelet derived growth factor pdgf and ifn 16 for example ifn- signals via jak1 and jak2 which in turn activate stat1 whereas il-6 a jak-stat dependent cytokine can signal via jak1 jak2 andor tyk2 and activates stat3 in t cells 19 as cytokine storm is relatively common in severe case and often leads to the exacerbation of covid-19 anti-inflammation therapy may help in preventing further injury as we know there are a variety of anti-inflammatory medications including jak inhibitor such drugs are predicted to be of particular importance in the treatment of severe covid-19
receptor-mediated endocytosis is the most common pathway for virus entry to the cells recently a cell surface protein known as angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 has been identified for sars-cov-2 in humans and animals ace2 expressed by cells in the kidney blood vessels heart and most importantly in lung at2 alveolar epithelial cells is the receptor used by sars-cov-2 to infect lung cells
1
 the ace2 receptor has several regulators among which ap2-associated protein kinase-1 aak1 and cyclin g-associated kinase gak two pivotal regulators mediate clathrin-dependent endocytosis
20
 baricitinib was expected to have a high binding affinity to aak1 and gak and interrupt the passage and intracellular assembly of sars-cov-2 into the target cells
21
 accordingly baricitinib is suggested to be trialed on patients with sars-cov-2 acute respiratory disease in order to reduce the viral entry and the associated inflammation nct04321993

baricitinib not only interrupts the passage and intracellular assembly of sars-cov-2 into the target cells but it also reduces the inflammation in patients with ards in severe covid-19 cases the jak-stat signaling pathway participates the cytokine storm excessive amounts of cytokines bind to their receptors and activates jaks which occurs upon ligand-mediated receptor multimerization since two jaks are close enough for trans-phosphorylation 22 the activated jaks phosphorylate the receptors activate and phosphorylate their main substrate stats phosphorylated stat dimerizes with other members of stat family with conserved sh2 domains finally the dimerized stats in the cytoplasm are transferred into the nucleus and combine to specific dna elements to regulate the expression of cytokine-responsive genes subsequently cytokine storm was finally inducedbaricitinib is an atp competitive kinase inhibitor that inhibits selectively effectively and reversibly jak1jak2 by suppressing jak1jak2 baricitinib intracellularly inhibits the proinflammatory signal of several cytokines such as il-6 il-12 il-23 and ifn- 6 it has been demonstrated clinical benefits for the patients with moderate or severe ra including reducing the incidence of structural joint damage 18 this drug might to lower the hyper inflammation or so-called cytokine storm caused by sars-cov-2 that would prevent damage to the lungs and possibly other organs see fig 1
however there are some different views on the theory of baricitinib to treat cytokine storms which needs to be clarified in certain pathological conditions the inflammatory process is widely recognized as a localized protective response of the body when it is attacked by pathogens such as sars-cov-2 the jak-stat is the primary signaling pathway regulated by cytokines and is crucial for initiating the innate immunity orchestrating the adaptive immune mechanisms and finally constraining the inflammatory and immune responses 16 23 it seems that using a jak1jak2 inhibitor to treat a viral disease might appear illogical given that the antiviral effects of ifn are largely mediated by the jak-stat signalling pathway so it is speculated here that in early asymptomatic disease and stages of the disease not requiring admittance to hospital approximately 80 of covid-19 patients are able to clear the virus through endogenous antiviral mechanisms certainly including the ifn therefore it is not recommended that baricitinib or other jak inhibitors be given to these individuals 24however both covid-19 and sars are characterized by an over exuberant inflammatory response akin to a so-called cytokine storm and viral load is not correlated with the worsening of symptoms 9 25 the clinically severe phase of covid-19 is accompanied by high levels of cytokine signalling all of which signal through the jak-stat pathway this finding suggests that when hospital care is required for patients with a pathogenic sars-cov-2 infection jak-stat pathway inhibition might be a potential strategy in patients with moderate disease requiring hospital care the peak sars-cov-2 load occurs within approximately 7 days of symptom onset and later as the viral titre decreases in some patients cytokine storm causes the severe phase of the disease 26when the human body is invaded by sars-cov-2 the immune system will release a large number of cytokines such as ifn- il-6 etc excessive amounts of cytokines bind to their receptors and activates jaks which occurs upon ligand-mediated receptor multimerization the activated jak phosphorylates the receptor activates and phosphorylates its main substrate stats for example ifn- signals via jak1 and jak2 which in turn activate stat1 whereas il-6 can signal via jak1 jak2 andor tyk2 and activates stat3 phosphorylated stat dimerizes with other members of stat family then the dimerized stats in the cytoplasm are transferred into the nucleus and combine to specific dna elements to regulate the expression of cytokine-responsive genes subsequently cytokine storm was finally induced
baracitinib has shown favorable pharmacokinetic properties such as low plasma protein binding affinity minimal interaction with cyp enzymes and drug transporters
27
 currently in the covid-19 outbreak baricitinib is being combined with different antivirals since this combination would decrease viral infectivity viral replication and control cytokine storm as of june 2 2020 we retrieved a total of 14 clinical trials of baricitinib in the treatment of covid-19 worldwide through the us national library of medicine 28 these trials were distributed in east asia europe north america and southeast asia 1 9 4 and 1 respectively a phase 23 clinical trial with the title of baricitinib therapy in covid-19 a pilot study on safety and clinical impact listed in italy nct04358614 has been completed in the trial twelve patients with a median age of 635 iqr 577-722 years were enrolled all consecutive hospitalized patients with moderate covid-19 pneumonia were administered baricitinib 4 mgday combined with lopinavirritonavir 20050mg bid for 2 weeks the last consecutive patients with moderate covid-19 pneumonia receiving standard therapy lopinavirritonavir 20050mg bid and hydroxychloroquine 400mgday for 2 weeks admitted before the date of the first baricitinib-treated patient served as controls baricitinib-treated patients were compared with controls excitingly the results showed that all clinical characteristics and respiratory function parameters significantly improved both at week 1 and week 2 in the baricitinib-treated group compared to baseline fever arterial oxygen saturation spo2 ratio arterial oxygen partial pressurefractional inspired oxygen pao2fio2 crp and modified early warning score mews significantly improved in the baricitinib-treated group compared with controls p 0000 0000 0017 0023 0016 respectively in the control group no significant changes were recorded at week 2 compared to baseline icu transfer was requested in 33 412 of controls and in none of the baricitinib-treated patients discharge at week 2 occurred in 58 712 of the baricitinib-treated patients vs 8 112 of controls p0027 baricitinib-treatment was well tolerated with no infections cardiovascular and hematologic aes occurred after 2 weeks treatment

baricitinib was approved by the european union for the treatment of ra patients in 2017 according to the us fda drug instructions baricitinib is recommended for adult patients with moderately to severely active ra who have had an inadequate response to one or more tnf antagonist therapies the recommended dose is 2 mgd
30
 so far there have been very few research reports about the extra-ra effects of baricitinib as is known that targeting cytokines and cytokine receptors with biologics has revolutionized the treatment of many immune and inflammatory diseases wallace dj et al found that baricitinib signifiantly improved the signs and symptoms of active systemic lupus erythematosus in patients who were not adequately controlled despite standard of care therapy
31
 recent studies reported that baricitinib improved clinical signs and symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and induced rapid reduction of itch
32

baricitinib has not been approved for cytokine storm caused by sars-cov-2 however as of april 29 2020 14 clinical trials of baricitinib in the treatment of covid-19 have been registered for reference and one of which has been completed with encouraging results in these clinical trials participants were administered baricitinib 2 mg or 4 mg po daily as monotherapy or in combination with antiviral drugs such as lopinavirritonavir for 7 to 14 dayswe can also refer to the patient eligibility criteria of current clinical trials to determine which covid-19 patients are suitable for receiving baricitinib however eligibility criteria of study participants fail to reach agreement because clinical trials of baricitinib are conducted under widely varying conditions 28 the more widely adopted inclusion criteria is laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection inpatients diagnosed with moderate to severe covid-19 and there is evidence of pneumonia covid-19 with risk factors hypertension diabetes cardiac disease chronic lung disease and obesity etc aged18 years while the more widely adopted exclusion criteria is history of thrombophlebitis patient with latent tuberculosistb infection pregnancy and lactation current herpes zoster infection evidence of concomitant bacterial infections treatment with other potent immunosuppressants concurrently absolute lymphocyte countalc05109l absolute neutrophil count anc10109l hemoglobin level hb8 gdl egfr60 mlmin173m2 ast or alt5 times uln
on the other hand it has been reported that baricitinib is not an ideal option for management of covid-19 on the ground of some research reports on small samples
33
 an epidemiologic study reported that alc in the non-survivors is 06109cellsl inter-quartile range 05-08109 cellsl another study reported that alc in patients receiving icu care is 04109l inter-quartile range 02-08109l unfortunately baricitinib is not recommended in patients with alc05109l anc10109l based on the foregoing baratinib is indeed not suitable for this group of patients receiving icu care in fact this did not conflict with the results of current clinical trials which recommended baricitinib for moderate to severe covid-19 patients
based on drug instructions of the us fda the following adverse reactions need to be noted  serious infections the most common serious infections reported with baricitinib included pneumonia herpes zoster and urinary tract infection  malignancy clinical drug application research has shown that malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers were reported in 2 patients treated with baricitinib 2 mg and 6 patients treated with baricitinib 4 mg during the 0 to 52 week treatment period thrombosis thrombosis including deep venous thrombosis dvt and pulmonary embolism pe has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with baricitiniblaboratory abnormalities such as neutropenia lymphopenia anemia thrombocytosis liver enzyme elevationsalt ast lipid elevationstotal cholesterol ldl hdl and elevation of creatine phosphokinase ckaccording to recent research reports baricitinib was generally well tolerated on the whole smolen js analyzed 3492 patients with moderate to severe active ra who received baricitinib for 6637 total patient-years of exposure median 21 yrs maximum 55 yrs and found no differences in rates of death adverse events leading to drug discontinuation malignancies major adverse cardiovascular event or serious infections were seen for baricitinib 4mgd versus placebo however infections including herpes zoster were significantly more frequent for baricitinib 4mgd versus placebo 34 coincidentally a meta-analysis of baricitinib in patients with ra showed that 4 mg of baricitinib increased herpes zoster infection as compared to placebo and 2 mg of baricitinib 35 an integrated analysis showed that during placebo-controlled period through week 24 there was 6 events 14 per 100 person-years reported in patients who received 4 mg baricitinib 36 another integrated analysis showed that older age obesity history of dvtpe and the use of selective cox-2 inhibitor were independent risk factors for venous thromboembolism 37 in fact 5 of the 6 patients who developed dvtpe had some of these risk factorsthe above adverse reactions data was obtained from a series clinical study of long course treatment with baricitinib however short-term use of baricitinib ie 7-14 days might reactivate no latent infections including herpesviruses or tuberculosis in covid-19 patients it needs to be further demonstratedbased on the above evidence pharmaceutical care of baricitinib mainly includes the followingavoid use of baricitinib in patients with active serious infection and active tb baricitinib is not recommended in patients with alc05109l anc10109l or hb8 gdl prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended if increases in alt or ast are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected interrupt baricitinib until this diagnosis is excluded  baricitinib should be used with caution in patients who have risk factors such as older age obesity history of dvtpe and the use of selective cox-2 inhibitorthe following information is mainly from the drug instructions of the us fda
pregnant women the limited human data on use of baricitinib in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage in animal embryo-fetal and post-natal development studies oral baricitinib administration to pregnant rats and rabbits at exposures equal to and greater than approximately 20-84 times the maximum recommended human dose mrhd resulted in reduced fetal body weights increased embryo lethality skeletal malformations and reduction in pup viability no developmental toxicity was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits treated with oral baricitinib during organogenesis at approximately 5 and 13 times the exposure at the mrhd respectively
older adults baricitinib is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function
patients with hepatic impairment no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment the use of baricitinib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is therefore not recommended
patients with renal impairment the recommended dose of baricitinib in patients with moderate renal impairment egfr 30-60 mlmin173m2 is 1 mg once daily baricitinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment egfr30 mlmin173 m2
as a cell surface protein ace2 is involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis for sars-cov-2 entry to the cells baricitinib a jak1jak2 inhibitor might be a potential strategy baricitinib would interrupt the passage and intracellular assembly of sars-cov-2 into the target cells by binding to aak1 and gak on the other hand the jak-stat signaling pathway participates the cytokine storm in moderate to severe covid-19 cases baricitinib is expected to treat cytokine storm caused by covid-19 by suppressing jak1jak2 and a number of clinical trials have been registered around the world one of which has been completed with encouraging results universally participants were administered baricitinib 2-4mg qd for 1-2 weeks we can refer to the current clinical trials to determine drug usage and applicable patients with covid-19 we look forward to more announcement of the results of these trials baricitinib was generally well tolerated on the whole the common and important adverse reactions are infections abnormal blood routine elevated liver enzymes and dvtpe whether the adverse reactions will occur during the short course treatment of covid-19 needs to be further demonstrated baricitinib should be used with caution in patients who have the above risk factors human data on use of baricitinib in pregnant women are not sufficient when using baricitinib in patients with renal insufficiency attention should be paid to dose adjustment or discontinuation

in december 2019 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first identified in wuhan china and has spread rapidly in many countries the team of nanshan zhong found that 879 patients had fever after hospitalization and in 157 patients this developed to severe pneumonia 1 when covid-19 progresses from severe to critical patients may develop severe cytokine storm secondary acute respiratory distress syndrome followed by shock tissue perfusion disorders and even multi-organ failure 2 cytokine storm is an important factor in the rapid progression of covid-19 therefore the treatment of cytokine storm is an important part of rescuing severe patients currently there is no specific drug for sars-cov-2 and cytokine storm induced by covid-19 the il-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab has been approved by the us fda for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome crs since il-6 is one of the key cytokines involved in infection-induced cytokine storm the treatment of cytokine storm induced by covid-19 with tocilizumab has broad prospects diagnosis and treatment plan of novel coronavirus pneumonia seventh trial edition in china recommends tocilizumab as an immunotherapy drug for critical patients 3 however the clinical experience and data of tocilizumab in the treatment of covid-19 are limited in this paper several authors who participated in the treatment and consultation of critical and difficult patients and had specific experience in the clinical application of tocilizumab will explain the role of cytokine storm in covid-19 the mechanism of tocilizumab in treatment of covid19 and the key points of pharmaceutical care according to the latest research reports and clinical trial progress so as to provide reference for the treatment of covid-19cytokines which are a group of small proteins secreted by cells and used mainly for inter-cell signaling and communication have a variety of biological functions such as regulating innate immunity adaptive immunity hematopoiesis cell growth and differentiation and repairing damaged tissues by binding to receptors 4 cytokines mainly include interleukin il interferon ifn tumor necrosis factor tnf colony stimulating factor csf chemokine and growth factor when the human body is invaded by bacteria and viruses the immune system will release a large number of cytokines 5 6 in this outbreak of covid-19 some infected patients would suddenly worsen in the later stage and eventually die from multiple organ failure and the aggravation was mainly caused by cytokine storm 7it can be considered that cytokine storm is a kind of over-immune phenomenon produced by the body in response to external stimuli and then an uncontrolled release of cytokines will lead to systemic inflammation in 1993 ferrara et al first proposed the concept of cytokine storm in graft-versus-host disease 8 then in 2003 after sars the concept of cytokine storm gradually emerged due to the extremely high mortality associated with multi-organ failure 9 in recent years chimeric antigen receptor t car-t cells as immunotherapy have used transgenic t cells to attack cancer cells and have shown remarkable efficacy against previously refractory malignancies however patients treated with car-t cells produce many potentially life-threatening toxic reactions and one of the most clinically significant toxic reaction is crs the clinical symptoms of crs involve multiple organ systems with life-threatening complications including fluid-refractory hypotension and cardiac dysfunction respiratory failure coagulopathy renal and liver failure crs occurs because of the high level of immune activation of lymphocytes macrophages or myeloid cells with a subsequent massive release of inflammatory cytokines in car-t cell-related crs the marked elevation of il-6 is considered to be one main factor of the symptoms the level of il-6 and ifn- increase after car-t treatment and then stimulate the differentiation of t helper th 17 cells inducing immunologic response and the development of crs 10 in many cases cytokine storm and crs are the same concept 11previous therapy for controlling cytokine storm with large doses of glucocorticoid may delay the clearance of coronavirus and cause complications of glucocorticoid therapy 12 therefore it is urgent to find new and specific drug treatment methodsa data analysis of 138 hospitalized covid-19 patients was published in jama on february 7 2020 13 and the course of disease was revealed for the first time in the deceased patients neutrophil counts d-dimer levels blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels continued to increase in the dying patients while lymphocyte counts continued to decrease it was suggested that the virus induced an increase in the number of neutrophils caused by cytokine storm leading to clotting activation hypoxia shock and acute kidney injury these pathological mechanisms may be closely relevant to the death of covid-19 patients 14 a number of recently published articles have analyzed the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients and consistently found that the lymphocyte count was significantly reduced in patients with pneumonia especially those with severe pneumonia while numerous cytokines such as il-6 il-10 il-2 and tnf and ifn- were significantly increased and pointed out that the high levels of il-6 and other cytokines in vivo were the main cause of the cytokine storm 1317 jing et al studied the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in peripheral blood of 40 patients with covid-19 and found that the t cell count and cytokine levels of the survivors with severe infection gradually recovered to the same level as those with mild infection in the following time points 17 as an inflammatory trigger il-6 was highly expressed in patients with covid-19 and could induce the differentiation of b lymphocytes and the production of antibodies and also participate in the immune response of the body by inducing the proliferation and differentiation of t lymphocytes 18 the team of haiming wei showed that after the sars-cov-2 infection cd4t lymphocytes were rapidly activated to become pathogenic th 1 cells and generate gm-csf etc the cytokines environment induced inflammatory cd14cd16 monocytes with high expression of il-6 and accelerated the inflammation these aberrant and excessive immune cells might enter the pulmonary circulation in huge numbers and play an immune damaging role in leading to lung functional disability and quick mortality 19 il-6 is also considered to be a key mediator of crs thus targeted drugs that inhibit il-6 can block crs or cytokine storm 20as a monoclonal antibody that can antagonize the il-6 receptor tocilizumab has promising prospects based on the efficacy of several studies on crs 21 22 tocilizumab is currently approved by the us fda for the treatment of severe crs in addition to idiopathic arthritis rheumatoid arthritis and giant cell arteritis significantly diagnosis and treatment plan of novel coronavirus pneumonia seventh trial edition in china 3 recommends that tocilizumab can be used in patients with extensive bilateral lung lesions and severe lung diseases who have elevated il-6 levels in laboratory teststhe mechanism of tocilizumab in the treatment of covid-19 remains unclear according to previous studies il-6 is secreted by almost all stromal cells and immune system cells such as b lymphocytes t lymphocytes macrophages monocytes dendritic cells mast cells and other non-lymphocytes such as fibroblasts endothelial cells keratinocytes glomerular mesangial cells and tumor cells 23 under normal circumstances the level of il-6 in the body is very low and it can be quickly synthesized to strengthen the bodys defense function when there is an infection or injury excessive release of il-6 can cause crs and the more severe the crs the higher the serum peak concentration of il-6 il-6 binds to its receptor il-6r to form a complex and then binds to the signal transducer glycoprotein 130 gp-130 to initiate signal transduction and trigger downstream signal transduction and gene expression il-6r exists not only in membrane-bound form mil-6r but also in soluble form sil-6r in the classical signal transduction pathway il-6 binds to mil-6r to form a complex and then binds to gp-130 causing downstream reactions such as anti-inflammatory effects that are limited to such cells that express mil-6r in the trans-signaling pathway il-6 forms a complex with sil-6r and gp-130 which initiates intracellular signal transduction in the absence of mil-6r and the pathway has inflammatory effects 24 the next steps were to induce the synthesis of acute reactive protein through two completely different signaling pathways one il-6 signaling pathway is mediated by the jakstat tyrosine kinase system while the other is mediated by the rasmitogen-activated protein kinase mapknf-b-il-6 pathway the former is a major pathway 25 26in the classical signal pathway many cells cannot respond to il-6 signal because of the lack of expression of il-6r while some of these cells can be stimulated by sil-6r-il-6 complex to respond to il-6 signal and cause cell signal transduction 25 27 the trans-presentation signal is suppressed by extracellular gp-130 and extracellular gp-130 can form a complex with sil-6r to prevent sil-6r from binding to membrane-bound gp-130 23the classical signal is limited to the cells macrophages neutrophils t cells etc that express il-6r and plays a leading role in the low level of il-6 however when the level of il-6 increases il-6 signal is widely expressed because gp-130 is everywhere in this way il-6 trans signaling via the sil-6r can activate virtually all cells of the body and then regulate pro-inflammatory reactions blocking of trans-signaling was effective in a variety of preclinical chronic and autoimmune disease models 28 tocilizumab which is a humanized anti-il-6r monoclonal antibody can bind to both mil-6r and sil-6r and then inhibit classical and trans-signals this may be its potential mechanism for the treatment of cytokine storm in covid-19 see fig 1to date several independent clinical trials have been initiated globally to explore the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab for the treatment of patients with covid-19a prospective multicenter randomized controlled clinical study led by the first affiliated hospital of university of science and technology of china has been registered in the chinese clinical trial registry this study included 188 patients with common type including critical risk factors and severe covid-19 and is expected to be completed in may 2020 29 see table 1in the first phase of the study all 14 covid-19 patients the oldest patient was aged 82 years including 9 severe patients and 2 critical patients had diffuse lesions in both lungs before treatment and 11 had persistent fever after treatment with the new regimen of tocilizumab combined with conventional therapy the body temperature of all 11 patients with fever dropped to normal within 24 h meanwhile the respiratory function and oxygenation index were improved in different degrees ct scan showed obvious improvement of pulmonary lesions in 4 patients therefore for patients with severe covid-19 caused by cytokine storm tocilizumab is a drug worthy of clinical researchin addition genentech a member of the roche group announced that the us fda has approved a phase iii clinical trial for tocilizumab to treat severe covid-19 pneumonia on march 23 2020 this is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase iii study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous tocilizumab added to standard of care in adult patients hospitalized with severe covid-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care the primary and secondary endpoints include clinical status mortality mechanical ventilation and icu variables patients will be followed up for 60 days post-randomization and an interim analysis will be conducted to look for early evidence of efficacy 30tocilizumab is recommended for adults and pediatric patients aged  2 years with car-t cell-induced severe or life-threatening crs to be used alone or in combination with glucocorticoids see table 2 for specific usage and dosage 32doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended in crs patients the duration of a single intravenous drip should be maintained for more than 1 h subcutaneous administration is not recommended for the treatment of crs if no clinical improvement in the signs and symptoms of crs occurs after the first dose up to 3 additional doses of tocilizumab may be administered the interval between consecutive doses should be at least 8 htocilizumab has not been approved for crs in china however diagnosis and treatment plan of novel coronavirus pneumonia seventh trial edition in china 3 recommended that tocilizumab could be used in patients with extensive lung lesions and severe diseases and those with high il-6 levels in laboratory tests for the first dose of 48 mgkg the recommended dose is 400 mg diluted to 100 ml with 09 sodium chloride injection and the infusion time is more than 1 h for patients with poor efficacy of the first dose an additional dose the dose is the same as before can be applied after 12 h with a maximum of 2 cumulative doses and a maximum of 800 mg for a single dosesince its introduction tocilizumab has shown good efficacy and safety in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases ferfar et al 33 summarized a number of literatures on tocilizumab treatment of takayasu arteritis and found that its use could reduce or even stop the dosage of glucocorticoids samson et al 34 prospectively observed 20 patients with giant cell arteritis treated with prednisone combined with tocilizumab 8 mgkg intravenous infusion once every 4 weeks and confirmed the same findings at 52 weeks of follow-upa randomized double-blind phase iii clinical study showed that 18 patients with takayasu arteritis treated with tocilizumab did not experience serious infections and deaths nor did they have new and more prominent safety issues compared with the placebo group 35 ferfar et al 33 reviewed the use of tocilizumab to treat 38 patients with takayasu arteritis including 2 cases of liver injury 2 cases of infection and 4 cases of leukopenia and the incidence of adverse drug reactions reached 21 this is consistent with the results of a chinese study on the safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of takayasu arteritis 36 however these studies are small in sample size and need to be further confirmed by multicenter large sample studiesbased on the above studies drug instructions of china and the us fda the following adverse reactions need to be noted 1 serious infections the most common serious infections included pneumonia urinary tract infection cellulitis herpes zoster gastroenteritis diverticulitis sepsis and bacterial arthritis 2 gastrointestinal perforations gastrointestinal perforations were primarily reported as complications of diverticulitis including generalized purulent peritonitis lower gi perforation fistula and abscess most patients who developed gastrointestinal perforations were taking concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids corticosteroids or methotrexate at the same time 3 infusion reactions the most frequently reported event on the 4 mgkg and 8 mgkg dose during the infusion was hypertension while the most frequently reported events occurring within 24 h after infusion were headache and skin reactions these events were not treatment limiting 4 anaphylaxis these reactions were generally observed during the second to fourth infusion of tocilizumab 5 abnormal laboratory indexes such as thrombocytopenia elevated liver enzymes and elevated lipid parameters total cholesterol ldl triglyceridesthe above adverse reactions data were obtained from a series of randomized controlled clinical studies of long-course treatment with tocilizumab however whether the adverse reactions will occur during the short-course treatment of covid-19 needs to be further demonstratedfor all these reasons the safety monitoring of tocilizumab mainly includes the following three points 1 risk of serious infections including tuberculosis bacteria invasive fungi viruses and other opportunistic infections leading to hospitalization or death if severe infection occurs tocilizumab should be discontinued until the infection is under control perform a latent tuberculosis test and if positive start treating tuberculosis before starting tocilizumab monitor active tuberculosis for all patients during treatment 2 tocilizumab should be used with caution in patients with absolute neutrophil count anc  2109l and is not recommended for patients with anc  05  109l tocilizumab should be used with caution in patients with a platelet count less than 100  103l and is not recommended for patients with platelet counts less than 50  103l 3 care should be taken when starting tocilizumab in patients whose alt or ast rises above the 15-fold upper limit of normal for patients whose alt or ast rises above the 5-fold upper limit of normal tocilizumab is not recommendedthe following information is mainly from the drug instructions of china and the us fdapregnant women it is known that tocilizumab actively crosses the placenta in late pregnancy and may affect the fetal immune response it is not yet possible to predict drug-related birth defects and the risk of miscarriage in animal reproduction studies 32 intravenous administration of tocilizumab during organogenesis in cynomolgus monkeys may result in miscarriage or stillbirth at doses higher than the maximum recommended dose of intravenous administration of 8 mgkg every 24 weeks animal experiments have shown that inhibition of the il-6 signal may interfere with cervical maturation expansion and contraction of the uterine muscle which may be potentially dangerous to the fetus 32older adults current studies suggest that patients aged  65 years treated with tocilizumab have a higher rate of severe infection than patients  65 years due to the higher infection rate of the elderly in general care should be taken in their treatment 32patients with liver damage there is a lack of pharmacokinetic data on the use of tocilizumab in patients with liver damagepatients with renal impairment mild renal impairment creatinine clearance  80 mlmin and  50 mlmin calculated by the cockcroft-gault formula did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab in clinical trials of giant cell arteritis approximately one-third of patients had moderate renal impairment at baseline creatinine clearance was between 30 and 59 mlmin and no effect on tocilizumab exposure was found in these patients 32it has been confirmed by the recent reports on the clinical characteristics of covid-19 and the mechanism of disease progression that cytokine storm played a key role in the rapid progress of the disease il-6 is one of the key cytokines involved in infection-induced cytokine storm tocilizumab can block the downstream signal transduction by binding mil-6r and sil-6r and play a role in the treatment of cytokine storm caused by covid-19 currently the usage and dosage of tocilizumab for covid-19 are still being explored the clinical use of tocilizumab can be referred to drug instruction from the us fda for the treatment of crs or diagnosis and treatment plan of novel coronavirus pneumonia seventh trial edition in china be aware of the risk of serious infection neutropenia or thrombocytopenia and liver damage caused by tocilizumab there is no need to adjust the dose of tocilizumab in patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency and the data of using tocilizumab in pregnant women and patients with liver injury are insufficientthe official covid-19 deaths recorded in the uk is in excess of 38000 in the usa is more than 100000 and in the world is greater than 360000 excess death rate is widely acknowledged as the most accurate measure of mortality in the current covid-19 pandemic even more so than the cumulative daily count of covid-19 deaths with the uk excess death rate has already exceeded 64000 is it appropriate to persevere with existing management of covid-19 infection without considering an alternative managementtreatment of patients with covid-19 infection is mainly supportive a proportion of patients also receive investigational treatment of one form or another with varying degrees of success specific treatments are generally of two types type i treatment is aimed at the virus either directly such as anti-viral favipiravir oseltamivir umifenovir remdesivir and others or indirectly by other mechanisms such as chloroquine hydroxychloroquine azithromycin and others type ii treatment is aimed at altering the immune status of patients either through conferring passive immunity by plasma rich in covid-19 antibody from patients who have recovered from covid-19 infection or by drug-induced immune modulationregulation the rationale for using immune modulation is the cytokine storm12 detected in patients with severe covid-19 infection it is believed that excessive cytokines are the products of hyperactive immune inflammatory response mounted by the host against the virus such dysregulated immune reaction akin to autoimmunity is thought to lead to the observed lung injury and correlated with grim clinical outcomein order to counteract the cytokine storm specific targeted and nonspecific immune regulatory therapies have been tried or at least suggested as followsspecific immune regulatory investigational therapies include interlukin-1 inhibitor anakinra interlukin-6 inhibitors sarilumab siltuximab and tocilizumab janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib and axl kinase inhibitor bemcentinibnonspecific immune regulatory investigational therapies include corticosteroids including methylprednisolone colchicine and interferon alpha and betaa host of miscellaneous drugs have also been tried or suggested including bevacizumab eidd-2801 fingolimod ivermectin leronlimab lopinavirritonavir and tocilizumabthe multiplicity of therapeutic agents considered as possible investigational treatment highlights the fact that none so far proved to be optimally safe and effective this may be due to our limited understanding at present of the mechanisms of development of the cytokine storm in terms of steps involved and sequence of events so that what is observed and presumed to be a cause and effect may indeed be epiphenomena rather than causally-related this can explain the apparent failure of even the most specific and directed form of therapies mentioned earlierhd iv ig is an established form of treatment for immune thrombocytopenic purpura itp the mechanism of action is believed to be down regulation of the immune response3 after the impressive success of this therapy as a definitive treatment of itp but mainly for the control of this condition to bring about a rapid increase in the platelet count whenever needed it was tried in other autoimmune conditions and proved to be highly effective and well-tolerated at present hd iv ig is used for the treatment of kawasaki disease guillain-barre syndrome chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and in a number of autoimmune dermatological conditions since the severity of covid-19 infection is correlated with the development of severe immune autoimmune inflammatory reaction the cytokine storm it is logical to expect hd iv ig also to be useful in this situation thanks to its immunomodulatory properties indeed there has been a published report from china of beneficial effect of hd iv ig in three patients with covid-19 infection4 the emergence of kawasaki like syndrome in association with covid-19 infection in children responsive to hd iv ig lends further support to treating cytokine storm of covid-19 infection with hd iv ig as it is recognised that kawasaki like syndrome is the paediatric form of the cytokine storm seen in adult patients infected with covid-19this is a chimeric mouse-human igg1 monoclonal antibody that targets cd20 a transmembrane protein expressed in b cells rituximab is primarily used in conjunction with chemotherapy to treat haematological malignancies such as large diffuse non-hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia5 following the discovery that concomitant autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis improved following rituximab treatment for haematological malignancies rituximab is now also used to treat an expanding range of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis6 autoimmune haemolytic anaemia pure red cell aplasia itp evans syndrome7 vasculitis granulomatosis with angiitis bullous skin disorders pemphigus systemic lupus erythematosus multiple sclerosis chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy to name but a few the rationale for the use of rituximab in covid-19 infection to prevent andor treat the cytokine storm depends on the multifaceted mode of action of rituximab in down-regulating the immune responses by at least three major independent mechanisms antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity complement mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis8 based on these mechanisms rituximab has been successfully used to treat a wide range of immuneautoimmune disorders and for this reason it is expected to be useful for the treatment of cytokine storm because it involves hyperactive immune reaction however since we do not fully understand at this stage the precise mechanism of development of cytokine storm and whether it involves b or t cell or both we cannot be certain without a clinical trial that rituximab use in this setting can be definitely efficacious furthermore the use of rituximab can be associated with severe reactions which are avoidable with certain precautions known by those familiar with its use to my knowledge rituximab has not been reported to have been used or suggested for use in the context of covid-19 infectionthalidomide was promoted in the late 1950s for anxiety sleep disturbance and morning sickness it was realised in 1961 that thalidomide use was associated with birth defects mainly because of its anti-angiogenic property9 thalidomide was not available for therapeutic use for nearly forty years until its anti-tumour effect in multiple myeloma was discovered in the late 1990s since then its use has gained popularity as a first line treatment for multiple myeloma in combination with other chemotherapy10 in some forms of leprosy erythema nodosum leprosum11 and tb tuberculous meningitis12 as a second line treatment of graft versus host disease13 in crohns disease rheumatic disorders and in some dermatological conditions14 thalidomide is known as an anti-inflammatory and a modulator of the immune responses through its effects on cytokines interlukin-1 6 10 and 12 but more importantly it selectively inhibits the production of human monocyte tumour necrosis factor tnf-alpha through enhanced degradation of tnf-alpha m-rna1516 through these complicated reactions it is highly likely that thalidomide will effectively dampen down the cytokine storm which in addition to causing lung injury may well be the trigger of the state of hypercoagulability observed in covid-19 patients tissue injury is a potent stimulator of thrombin generation and clot formation it follows that treatment of cytokine storm would probably prevent andor treat both lung injury as well as hypercoagulability however thalidomide has its own set of undesirable side effects including peripheral neuropathy thrombocytopenia anaemia and paradoxically venous thromboembolism patients requiring treatment for the cytokine storm probably only need treatment in the short term whereas the side effects of thalidomide treatment apart from sleepiness are likely to appear after a relatively prolonged use nevertheless it would be prudent to add low molecular weight heparin in the prophylactic dose to the treatment protocol to my knowledge thalidomide or its analogues have not been reported to have been used or suggested for use in the context of covid-19 infectionof the three investigational drugs i have proposed thalidomide is the easiest to use because it is taken orally whereas the other two are administered intravenously if proven safe and effective in a randomised controlled clinical trial thalidomide is likely to become the drug of choice to treat andor prevent cytokine storm fatal complication of covid-19 infection but the main drawback is the teratogenic effect of thalidomide if and when taken during pregnancyall three proposed investigational treatments should only be administered to patients in the context of randomised controlled clinical trials in order to derive the maximum benefit from their use to guide the treatment of other patients in the future timing of treatment is crucial for the success since the proposed treatment is not meant to be for the viral infection but aimed at treatment for its severe inflammatory complication treatment should be reserved in the first instance for patients whose conditions have deteriorated after hospital admission success is measured in terms of recovery and prevention of the need for treatment in an intensive care unit icu andor recovery and reduction of stay in an icu since recovery can happen spontaneously with best supportive care the proposed trials should have sufficient discerning statistical power in terms of patient numbers to demonstrate whether each of these three investigational remedies when used in conjunction with best supportive care either as single agents or in combination are superior to the control arm of best supportive care only if and when such superiority has been demonstrated the investigation may be progressed to administer the medicines with proven anti cytokine storm activity on admission of patients with covid-19 infection to hospital in further randomised controlled trails with the aim of preventing rather than treating cytokine storms alternatively early treatment for prevention of complications on admission to hospital versus late treatment for cases of diagnosed cytokine storm complication may be conducted as different arms of the same trails in one stage rather than in two stages to save patients lives time and effortthe differences between the current management of covid-19 infection and the alternative management is that we are aiming actively in the latter at reduction of the development of cytokine storm complication of covid-19 infections reduction of the need for icu admission and most importantly reduction of the mortality rate consequently more patients will recover clinically and return to the community they may develop sufficient protective immunity likely to be more than conferred by vaccination or may continue as virus carriers but this may not be such a bad thing because the infection is spreading in the community anyway unabated all the time in a silent manner as most infections are not symptomatic infections symptomatic or otherwise are all contributing to the build-up of active protective immunity in the community at large the herd immunityto ease and eventually end the current lockdown safely without risking a second and subsequent waves of covid-19 infection humanity is pinning its hopes on the development of a safe and effective vaccine which may or may not materialise even in the long term because the indications are the immune response may not confer sufficient protection or is short-lived virus mutation is another worrying consideration the development of a safe and effective anti-viral therapy to covid-19 does not seem at present to be a brighter prospect either i have presented a third approach to take the sting out of the deadly covid-19 and convert it to a tame infectionwhen we deprive covid-19 of its cytokine storm we downgrade it to behave just like any other form of influenza furthermore the availability of safe and effective remedies proven by randomised controlled clinical trials for the deadly and most feared complication of covid-19 infection the cytokine storm is likely to make the decision to ease and eventually to lift the lockdown acceptable particularly in parts of the united kingdom and parts of the world in which there has been reluctance to ease the lockdownthe coronavirus infectious disease 2019 covid-19 that is spreading at the global scale is caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 an enveloped single-stranded rna virus belonging to the coronaviridae family genus beta-coronavirus 1 non-structural proteins of this virus play a crucial role in virus replication while structural and auxiliary proteins are involved in morphogenesis and interfere with the host immunity response respectively 2accumulating evidence suggests that the host immunity response is contributing in severe forms of mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infections 3 4 5 this immune response has been associated with a higher intensive care unit icu admissions and mortality in covid-19 in fact higher concentrations of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf interferon gamma-induced protein 10 ip10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha mip1a and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf in comparison to non-icu patients were reported in patients with covid-19 5 in another study higher levels of interleukin-2 il-2 receptor interleukin-6 il-6 interleukin-8 il-8 interleukin-10 il-10 and tnf were found in deceased patients with covid-19 compared to patients who had recovered from the disease 6these immunologic reactions in severe covid-19 may characterize the cytokine storm that is associated with untoward clinicopathological consequences the cytokine storm is an out-of-control cytokine release that has been observed in some infectious and noninfectious diseases leading to a hyperinflammation condition in the host fig1
7 this uncontrolled cytokine response might be accompanied with more immune cells activation including t helper 17 cell th17 differentiation from cd4 lymphocytes in fact increased th17 responses were reported in mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 8 9 10 11at least 10 of the patients with severe covid-19 will eventually present lung injury acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and involvement of multiple organs within 8-14 days of the onset of their illness 12 these severe cases that develop respiratory failure show a series of pathological findings such as hyaline membrane formation inflammatory infiltration with multinucleated syncytial cells in their lung pathology and a burst of cytokine release leading to morbidity and mortality 6 12the initial cellular entry phase of the sara-cov-2 requires binding of its envelope homotrimeric spike glycoprotein to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 on the target cell 12 13 the attachment of the virus with ace2 as its cellular receptor triggers internalization of the complex into the target cell leading to the down-regulation of the ace2 14ace2 internalization and its subsequent down-regulation would potentially result in unopposed function of angiotensin ii angii and decreased levels of angiotensin-1-7 14 since angiotensin-1-7 has a key counter-regulatory role in many of the angiotensin type 1 receptor at1r-related physiopathological functions the sara-cov-2-mediated downregulation of ace2 and the resulting increased overall ratio of ang ii to angiotensin-1-7 leads to the deterioration of the pulmonary function and lung injury 13 15therefore the imbalance of ace2ace levels in covid-19 and the dysregulated angiotensin-ii at1r axis of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas may partially be responsible for the cytokine storm and the resulting pulmonary damage 16 17 the loss of the modulatory effect of angiotensin-1-7 via its binding to the mas receptor masr that attenuates inflammatory response may be a further contributing factor to the hyper-inflammation status of severe cases of covid-19beyond ace2 catalytic activity in raas and masr-mediated actions it has interesting effects on multiple molecular pathways which are involved in inflammatory response and cytokine release however potential cellular and molecular mechanisms of the cytokine storm in covid-19 have not yet been explored extensivelyin this review we specifically discuss the complex inflammatory molecular consequents of downregulation of ace2 in the context of sars-cov-2 with a particular emphasis on the complement system and des-arg9-bk or dabk in addition to ace angiotensin-iiat1r and ace2masr axes we propose a unifying molecular model to better understand the complex molecular events behind out-of-control cytokine response in severe covid-19 patients undoubtedly this insight will be pivotal to obtain a harmonized therapeutic strategy to confront this deadly viral infection and to protect the lungs during the cytokine stormthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas through its vasoactive peptides regulates blood pressure fluid volume sodium and potassium balance this elegant system also plays a significant role in the promotion and maintenance of inflammation 18it appears that activation of the raas system can induce inflammation in an independent mechanism of blood pressure through the at1 receptor at1r in the kidney and vasculature 19 the secretion of profibrotic cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta tfg- is stimulated during raas activation 20 21 22 furthermore increased production of ang ii and activation of at1r are accompanied with a pro-inflammatory response via activation of the complement cascade including c5a c5b-9 23 this implies a cross-talk between raas and the complement systemang ii can activate the nuclear factor kappa b nf-b pathway 24 25 via stimulation of the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of nf-b 26 this will lead to increased production of il-6 27 tnf il-1b and il-10 26 after at1r activation ang ii regulates mitogen-activated protein kinases mapk erk12 jnk p38mapk which have important functions on cellular processes including the release of cytokines such as il-1 il-10 il-12 and tnf fig2
 28 29 30ace2 enzyme is expressed in the heart kidneys testes gastrointestinal tract and lungs 15 31 it cleaves the angiotensin i ang i to generate the inactive ang-19 peptide which can be changed to the vasodilatory peptide ang-17 by ace or other peptidases ace2 can also directly metabolize ang ii to generate ang-1-7 32sars-cov-2 uses ace2 in type ii pneumocytes of lung alveoli and club cells in bronchioles as the cellular entry receptor very recently tmprss2 as a major host protease and ace2 co-expression was reported among a subset of type ii pneumocytes in the lung 31after the attachment of sars-cov-2 spike s-protein to ace2 its intracellular binding site down-regulates ace2 consequently following this down-regulation of ace2 ang ii level increases in the serum leading to augmentation of the ang iiat1r axis activation which is followed by trans-signaling of il-6-sil-6ra complex in which the gp 130-mediated activation of stat3 occurs in the lungs epithelial cells although sars-cov-2 itself activates nf-b through pattern recognition receptors it is the simultaneous activation of nf-b and stat3 that enhances nf-b activation machinery the il-6 amplifier this hyper-activation of nf-b via the il-6 amp in the lungs induces a cytokine storm with subsequent ards that had been observed in severe covid-19 patients 33 34indeed down-regulation of ace2 which was accompanied with enhancement of ang ii levels in different types of lung injury triggered those pulmonary pathological changes that are commonly observed in ards 35given the above premises it seems reasonable to speculate that depletion of ace2 and activation of aceangiotensin iiat1r axis might have a pivotal role in the clinical presentations of covid-19 in fact higher circulatory levels of ang ii were reported in covid-19 patients than the control subjects and these plasma levels of ang ii were linearly associated with lung injury 36 therefore in contrast to earlier clinical experts opinions raas inhibitors should not be discontinued in stable cases of covid-19 because the discontinuation of ace inhibitors and arbs may potentially have detrimental effects on these patients 14 37 38 in a recent study the first clinical evidence has shown that ace inhibitors or arb therapy in covid-19 patients with hypertension were associated with a lower rate of disease severity a trend toward lower il-6 levels and higher circulatory cd3 and cd4 t cells counts 39the protective effect of ace2 in severe acute lung failure has been shown in animal models 40 the accumulating clinical-epidemiological evidence about covid-19 implies that sars-cov-2 associated ace2 depletion is accompanied with a severe clinical course of disease in those clinical and epidemiological conditions that jeopardize the levels of ace2 expression including older age male sex and medical conditions diabetes mellitus hypertension and cardiovascular diseases and obesity 41 42 under these medical conditions the covid-19 infection-induced ace2 depletion could not overcome already exaggerated aceangiotensin iiat1r axis activity hence administration of recombinant soluble ace2 to patients with severe covid-19 infection may be a therapeutic modality however it is worthwhile to consider targeting downstream of aceangiotensin iiat1r axis such as il-6-stat3 axis 34 to combat the observed cytokine storm in covid-19 in order to prevent lung inflammation and end organ damageace2 ang-1-7 and ang-1-7 receptor mas are the constituents of the other arm of the ras system which counteracts and attenuates the effects of ace-ang ii-at1r axis 43 44 ace2 derives vasodilatory peptide ang-1-7 from ang ii following a cleavage activity this vasodilatory peptide has anti-proliferative anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory activities 45 46 47ang-1-7 reduces the expression of p38 mapk and nf-b and inflammatory factors such as il-6 tnf and il-8 48 49 50 51 thus ang-1-7 per se has an anti-inflammatory effect and ameliorates inflammatory damages as revealed in several animal studies 52 53 it has been shown that ang-1-7 reduces inflammatory cardiac injury in diabetic hypertensive rats 52 and glomerular involvement in mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis mpgn rat models 53the protection of vascular endothelium and renal tubular cells diuresis and vasodilation-dependent ang-1-7 effects occur via masr 54 55 mas receptors express in the epithelium and bronchial smooth muscle therefore ang 1-7 could modulate acute and chronic inflammatory processes in the lung via activation of masr 56 a range of physiological effects of ang- 1-7 is present in different tissues such as heart brain and kidney by its action on masr 57ang-1-7 also attenuates ang ii induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 icam-1 vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 vcam-1 and mcp1 expression by masr activation leading to inhibition of the p38mapk and nf-b pathways 58erk 12 pathway modulates production of il-10 59 that induces differentiation of t-helper toward th2-type th-2 regulates immune responses by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines like il-4 il-5 il-9 and il-13 60 additionally il-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that may be involved in the prevention of tissue damage 61 62 ang-1-7 modulates the activity of erk 12 fig2 63 64 65therefore ang-1-7 has an anti-inflammatory function via modulation of nf-b mapk and erk 12 pathways hence it may be proposed that sars-cov-2 associated suppression of ace2 which would be accompanied with reduction of all mas receptor-mediated functions leads to accentuation of the cytokines release and frank inflammatory responses because ang-1-7 exerts a critical role in counteracting the pro-inflammatory effect of raas protecting from endothelial cell activation and resulting lung damage from inflammatory mediators in the cytokine storm the administration of ang-1-7 or one of its similar agents to patients with covid-19 pneumonitis has been suggested 35 66the kinin-kallikrein system includes kininogen kallikrein enzyme bradykinin bk-1-9 or bk and des-arg9-bk or dabk 67 68 the active products of this system interact with two distinct g-protein coupled receptors the bradykinin b1 receptor bkb1r and bradykinin b2 receptor bkb2r the main ligand of bkb1r is dabk and the ligand of bkb2r is bk 69 70 bkb1r could hardly be detected in peripheral tissues in normal states however it is expressed on the cell types involved in inflammation therefore it is an inducible pro-inflammatory receptor 71 the expression of bkb1r as a specific receptor of bradykinin pathway is highly sensitive to inflammatory mediators such as lipopolysaccharide lps and interleukins 70 72 73 74 it is also up-regulated by cytokines such as il-1b and tnf 75 76 77 il-2 ifn epidermal growth factor egf and oncostatin increase the rate of bkb1r receptor mediated response 77 78 79 80 it should be mentioned that il-1b and tnf-induced bkb1r expression is related to nf-b activity 81 sodhi et al82 showed that activation of bkb1r enhances the neutrophil attraction to tissue by release of chemokine c-x-c motif chemokine 5 cxcl5 activity of this receptor leads to expression of fgf-2 83 and to increased levels of il-1b 84 and mcp1 fig3
 85dabk is a known pulmonary inflammatory factor 86 87 88 89 it is interesting that ace2 also cleaves terminal residue of dabk 90 91 this reaction results in deactivation of dabk therefore it could be postulated that covid-19-induced reduction of ace2 activity would be accompanied with increased activity of dabk and the resulting accentuation of the aforementioned inflammatory cascade leading to increased cytokine release hence targeting the ace2 dabk bradykinin b1 receptor axis has been suggested by some authors 92 93 to prevent or control ards in patients with severe covid-19 although several bkb1 antagonists have passed phase ii clinical trials none have been approved yet for clinical use 71the complement system is an ancient system that contributes to innate immune response this system includes many proteins and cleavage products that plays a key functional role in defense against microorganisms including viruses the viral inactivation by the complement cascade involves virus uptake and clearance by phagocytic cells coating virions resulting in prevention of attachment with their receptors virus lysis by pore formation and destruction of its membrane by membrane attack complex formation c5b-9 94following viral-induced complement cascade activation inflammatory processes are promoted complement factor 5a c5a is the strongest inflammatory peptide in the complement cascade that induces release of pro-inflammatory cytokines 95 96 97 98  c5a can also induce secretion of tnf- 99 100 terminal products of the complement cascade can induce the production of cytokines such as tnf- and il-1 98 101 102 103 104 terminal complement component c5b-9 induces release of il-6 via activation of redox-sensitive transcription factor nf-b and activator protein-1 ap-1 105 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp1 from vascular smooth muscle cells 106 also the increased production of c3a leads to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 and tnf- 107the involvement of the complement system in the pathogenesis of syncytial virus infection mers-cov and sars-cov has been examined in several studies 108 109 110 the hyper activation of complement components including c5a in sera and c5b-9 in lungs was observed in mers-cov-infected hdpp4-transgenic mice the lung and spleen-induced pathological damages and inflammatory responses were alleviated through blockade of the c5ac5ar axis in those transgenic mice 110gralinski et al 109 showed that mice models deficient in c3c3-- loads in the lung had milder sars-cov induced pathologic features such as better respiratory function lower weight loss reduced pathologic findings in respiratory system and lower circulatory and tissue cytokines and chemokines despite equal lung viral loads compared to the controls these results showed that although the complement system had no role in virus replication activation of complement system in the lungs of sars-cov infected mice might lead to immune mediated damages in the lungs 109the complement cascade can be activated by the lectin pathway fig4
 by priming the immune system and enhancing clearances of viruses and virus-infected cells 111  the lectin pathway may also be involved in covid-19 pathogenesis recently gao et al 108 reported in a very interesting study the involvement of complement cascade aberrant activation in the pathogenesis of sarsmers-cov or sars-cov-2 via viral nucleocapsid n protein-mediated masp-2 auto-activation and binding to mannose-binding lectin mlb masp-2 is the main serine protease in the lectin pathway that induces downstream complement cascade via the mlb pathway resulting in accelerated inflammatory responses and lung damages in another arm of the aforementioned study the contribution of sars-cov-2 n protein in activation of the complement cascade was investigated in lungs of patients who expired with covid-19 not only were deposition of the complement components including c3 c3a and c5b-9 observed in lung autopsies but elevated circulatory levels of c5a were also reported in severe cases of covid-19 108magro et al 112 reported a pauci-inflammatory changes and lack of viral cytopathic effects accompanied with heavy deposition of c5b-9 c4d and mbl-masp2 in lung septal vasculatures of 5 patients with covid-19-induced respiratory failure indicative of unrestrained activation of the alternative and lectin cascades in these patientsgiven the above animal and clinical studies it is tempting to target the components of complement in severe covid-19 a promising clinical response including increased lung oxygenation and alleviation of systemic inflammation was reported in two patients with covid-19 who received an anti-c5a antibody 108c5a as the most potent complement derived mediator of inflammation in response to infections increases production of il-6 tnf and il-1 from toll-like receptor tlr-2 tlr-4 tlr-9 stimulated macrophages 113 114 however the c5a-c5r axis inhibition by the available pharmaceutical agents would be partial and the activity of residual terminal complement components might remain therefore targeting the upstream activators of the complement cascade such as c3a-c3ar axis may be more effective in restraining the uncontrolled complement pathway activation in severe covid-19 115 very recently the compstatin-based complement c3 inhibitor amy-101 was administered to a patient with ards due to covid-19 in which very good clinical responses with a high level of safety were reported 116the overall clinical benefits of targeting the c3a-c3arc5a-c5ar axis in order to control maladaptive immune-inflammatory consequences of the complement pathways in severe covid-19 remains to be clarified in the near futurethe covid-19 cytokine storm like the other cytokine storms in infectious and non-infectious conditions may be considered as a complex network the complex network of the cytokine response was described by tisoncik et al 7 as a series of overlapping networks each with a degree of redundancy and with alternative pathwaysour aforementioned pathogenesis of the so-called covid-19 cytokine storm through the four described distinct axes clarified that this cytokine storm complex network has many components which might cross-talk with each other in multiple known and unknown interfaces these interactions in a network state imply the complex nature of the covid-19 cytokine storm the dynamic equilibrium of the network components could be disturbed at multiple sites to emerge an untoward behavior in covid-19 cytokine storm this perturbation is initiated via attachment of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to its receptor ace2 followed by the aceang iiat1r axis activation leading to hyper-activation of nf-b by il-6 stats axis 34 in the normal dynamic equilibrium state the aceang iiat1r axis activation is counterbalanced by ace2masr axis and production of ang-1-7 that reduces the expression of p38 mapk and nf-b and inflammatory factors such as il-6 tnf and il-8 49 50 51 however sars-cov-2 associated down-regulation of ace2 suppresses these immunomodulatory effects leading to accentuation of the cytokine release responsewe currently know that dabk is a pulmonary inflammatory factor whose deactivation by ace2 is deranged by covid-19-induced reduction of ace2 activity this derangement is followed by ace2 dabk bradykinin b1 receptor axis activation that creates a pro-inflammatory synergistic effect for sars-cov-2 associated aceang iiat1r axis activation the resulting effect would be a more inflammatory state neutrophil recruitment and enhancement of pathological pulmonary changes that are observed in ards of severe covid-19we have already discussed the involvement of the complement system in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 via its nucleocapsid n protein-mediated masp-2 auto-activation and binding to mlb in the lectin arm of c3a-c3arc5a-c5ar axis 108 however the increased production of ang ii and activation of at1r may be accompanied with pro-inflammatory response via activation of the complement cascade including c5a c5b-9 23 this implies a cross-talk between aceangiotensin iiat1r axis and the complement systemsimilar to other complex networks elements from the complex network of the covid-19 cytokine storm may experience much cross-talk with elements from known and unknown pathways and networks for example ang ii as an element from aceang iiat1r induces tgf- expression 22 117 tgf- has a role in the differentiation of t helper 17 cells from naive cd4 t-cells th-17 cells generate il-17 gm-csf il-21 and il-22 il-17 itself promotes the production of a vast amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 8 118 il-17 was among the cytokines that were significantly correlated with the lung injury murray score and disease severity in covid-19 119 an increment of the highly pro-inflammatory ccr6 th17 in cd4 t cells was reported in covid-19 associated with ards 9 therefore targeting il-17 and t helper 17 responses in the cytokine storm of covid-19 have been suggested 8 118from a unifying point of view systems medicine approaches are required to understand the interactions among the different elements of the complex network of the covid-19 cytokine storm undoubtedly the clarification of hierarchy of the components of this complex network across different organizational levels will expand our armamentarium of treatments to tackle covid-19therapeutic plasma exchange is a well-known therapeutic option that can be considered in the treatment of autoimmune diseases the beneficial effect of this modality works through elimination of autoantibodies complement components immune complexes and cytokines therefore this option may be valuable in the treatment of severe covid-19 120 however application of this therapeutic modality is a general approach to confront the cytokine storm hence other approaches may be considered in the treatment of the covid-19 driven cytokine storm in order to protect lungs from injury table 1
according to the aforementioned axes which may be involved in the cytokine storm of severe cases of covid-19 some potential targets could be considered as therapeutic optionsthe first one is recombinant human ace2 there are some trials regarding the efficacy and safety of this agent in clinicopathological settings related to ace2 decrement such as congestive heart failure chf 121 ards 122 123 and lung injury due to viral illness such as respiratory syncytial virus rsv 124 the reported findings about safety and efficacy were promising very recently monteil et al125 reported that human recombinant soluble ace2 hrsace2 can prevent entry of sars-c0v-2 to the human blood vessel organoid and human kidney organoid this finding may suggest a highly compelling therapeutic intervention to protect lung injury in covid-19we suggested ace2bradykinindabk may be involved in the inflammatory response of sars cov-2 therefore blockade of this axis by inhibiting bkb1r may ameliorate a part of the cytokine storm which occurs in covid-19 infection lf22-0542 safotibant is a bkb1r antagonist with promising anti-inflammatory results 126 127 several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of this drug in multiple medical settings they have had promising results fig3 71regarding the pivotal role of the complement system in the cytokine storm and activation of th-17 every effort should be made to suppress the activation of this elegant cascade c5a as a potent component of this system is a good target for alleviation of pro-inflammatory responses to severe covid-19 eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody with high affinity to c5 near its cleavage site 128 this agent prevents the formation of c5a and c5b-9 it has been reported that this monoclonal antibody has beneficial effects in the treatment of diseases where their pathogenesis are based on complement activation 129 in a preliminary study conducted by gao et al 108 two patients with severe covid-19 received anti-c5a antibodies although the final effect of this type of therapeutic modality remains to be published the two patients showed dramatic clinical responses 108c3 blockade is another component of the complement system that can be targeted compstatin is a cyclic inhibitor of c3 cleavage 129 that may be considered in severe covid-19 complement receptor1 cr1 is a cofactor to inactivate c3b and c4b and inhibits the activation of c3 through all active pathways the recombinant form of soluble cr1 is developed which can block complement activation in serum samples from patients with c3-glomerulonephritis fig4 130in conclusion accumulating evidence suggests that sars-cov-2 driven ace2 down-regulation leads to an array of complex and intertwined molecular interactions via at least four axes consisting of dysregulation of the aceangiotensin iiat1r axis attenuation of ace2masr axis increased activation of ace2bradykinin b1rdabk axis and activation of the complement cascades resulting in the observed cytokine storm in severe covid-19the elucidation of molecular events of the aforementioned axes which might be involved in the pathogenesis of ards and lung injury in fulminant infections with sars-co-v-2 will promise novel therapeutic options for prevention or attenuation of the inflammatory cytokine release response that are observed nowadays in patients with severe covid-19mm in jr sf and mk interpreted and wrote the manuscript in and mm supervised the study all authors read and approved the final manuscriptthe authors declare the following financial interestspersonal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests an award was given to iraj nabipour by novo nordisk pars the best innovator of diabetes in iran 2013 for the remaining authors none were declaredfever dry cough shortness of breath myalgia fatigue a tendency for leucopenia and radiological signs of progressive pneumonia which may cause ards are similar clinical and laboratory findings seen in covid-19 sars-cov and mers-cov infections this may suggest that their pathogenesis may also be similar 2 we believe that any hypothesis covering covid-19 pathogenesis should explain very high serum levels of both ferritin and d-dimer levels disproportionate with the severity of infection as well as a tendency for monocytosis rather than lymphocytosis including a low number of natural killer nk and cytotoxic t cells and finally tendency for dic indeed these striking features mainly reflect the presence of mas and cytokine stormspike glycoproteins are the most immunogenic parts of the coronaviruses which may bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace-2 receptors to enter the host cell similarities were shown between spike glycoproteins of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 distribution of ace-2 receptor expression intensely on the surface of alveolar epithelial type ii cells cardiac renal intestinal and endothelial cells is consistent with the target organs involved and the clinical picture in covid-19 infection 2 4sars-cov-2 spreads primarily with direct contact through droplets of saliva or discharge from the respiratory tract when an infected person coughs or sneezes 1 following binding to the cell surface receptor of ace-2 by the spike glycoprotein it enters the cell cytoplasm where it releases rna genome and replicates resulting in the formation of new viral particles then the cell disintegrates and the virus spreads to other cellsas the immune system recognizes the viral antigens antigen-presenting cells process these antigens and present them both to the natural killer and cd8-positive cytotoxic t cells in the context of major tissue histocompatibility mhc antigens as usual this presentation activates both innate and adaptive immunity causing the production of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in some patients this activation becomes so massive that cytokine storm develops resulting in thrombotic tendency and multi-organ failure and eventually causing death 5 6another pathogenic mechanism independent from binding to cell surface ace-2 binding was also speculated claiming that the virus might bind to the beta chain of porphyrins inside the erythrocytes resulting in disturbance of heme metabolism and release of iron however this speculation needs further investigation and remains elusive 7 8zhang at al reported that the number of t lymphocytes including both cd4 and cd8 subtypes and especially nk cells are much lower than expected in patients with severe disease course 9 the number of regulatory t cells is also very low severe lymphopenia is a very early sign of the disease preceding pulmonary problems and tends to normalize as the patient improves lymphopenia is included among diagnostic criteria in china despite low numbers both cd4 and cd8 positive lymphocytes express the high amount of hladr4 and cd38 showing hyperactivity additionally cd8 t cells harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules ie 316 were perforin positive 642 were granulysin positive and 305 were both granulysin and perforin positive total leukocyte and neutrophil counts and neutrophillymphocyte ratio nlr are increased especially in severe cases nlr may be used as a follow-up parameter in patients with covid-19 infection 10 11 generally the number of cd8 t lymphocytes recovers in 23 months whereas it may take nearly a year for the memory cd4 t lymphocytes to recover in sars cov infection 913besides low numbers of peripheral lymphocytes there is striking atrophy of the secondary lymphoid organs including the lymph nodes and spleen confirmed by autopsy findings necrosis-associated lymph node and spleen atrophy significant splenic cell degeneration focal hemorrhagic necrosis macrophage proliferation and increased macrophage apoptosis in the spleen have been reported immunohistochemical staining showed decreased numbers of cd4 positive and cd8 positive t cells in the lymph nodes and spleen 14 15on the other hand monocytes and macrophages are increased which may explain elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin il-6 il-1 tumor necrosis factor tnf and il-8 which in some patients turn out to be a cytokine storm as discussed more in detail laterthe great majority of the inflammatory cells infiltrating the lungs are monocytes and macrophages autopsy findings showed the presence of monocytes and macrophages and a moderate amount of multinucleated giant cells associated with a diffuse alveolar injury however pulmonary infiltrating lymphocytes were scarce and mostly cd4 positive these findings were not different than those reported for patients with sars-cov and mers-cov infections 14in patients with covid-19 elevated d-dimer levels are important and persistent elevation confers to poor prognosis development of dic is another problem characterized by prolongation of prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time high fibrin degradation products and severe thrombocytopenia which may be life-threatening 16thrombotic tendency in covid-19 patients is probably caused by endothelial cell activation or damage due to viral binding to the ace-2 receptor the presence of traditional risk factors for venous thromboembolism was found to be high among covid-19 patients high levels of inflammatory mediators and immunoglobulins may lead to higher blood viscosity mechanical ventilation and vascular interventions such as central venous catheterization may further induce vascular endothelial damage in severe or critically ill patients anticardiolipin antibody levels were also found to be high in small groups reported the combination of all these factors may lead to deep vein thrombosis or even possibly to lethal pulmonary thromboembolism therefore covid-19-infected patients whether hospitalized or ambulatory need early and prolonged prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin 9 16 on the other hand ischemic changes in the fingers and toes mimicking vasculitis have been reported in patients with severe covid-19 13the quick interpretation of these issues outlined above shows that the disease starts as a simple viral infection but goes out of control after a while and progresses towards a deadly result with development of the cytokine storm and serious organ damage to understand why and how this process occurs and what we can do to control this process we need to know further details of the pathogenesis of covid-19 and cytokine stormin the context of the normal innate immune system macrophages monocytes dendritic cells and neutrophils express a variety of pattern recognition receptors prrs that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps which are expressed by infectious agents among prrs the membrane-bound family of toll-like receptors tlrs recognizes mainly the pamps in the extracellular and to a lesser account in the intracellular milieu the triggered signaling process leads to the expression of proinflammatory cytokine-inducing transcription factors such as nf-kb as well as to activate interferon regulatory factors that mediate the type i interferon-dependent antiviral response 17 the second set of pathogen recognition sensors is present in the cytosol and includes another family of nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat nlr proteins nlrp1 nlrp3 nlrp7 and nlrc4 the protein absent in melanoma 2 aim2 and pyrin these sensors are essential for the detection of endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns damps expressed inside the cell binding of damps activates nlrs triggering the formation of multiprotein cytoplasmic complexes called inflammasomes which convert procaspase-1 to active caspase-1 then caspase-1 converts proil-1 to active il-1 which is a very important proinflammatory cytokine 17 18 fig 1 it should be noted that if these signaling activation processes are kept under control they serve for the benefit of the human bodyfor the viruses pamps are generally their nucleic acids viral rna binds to endosomal tlr-3 tlr-7 and cytosolic receptors including rig-i like receptors rlrs rlr family consists of three members namely retinoic acid-induced gene i rig-i melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 mda5 and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 lgp2 19 20 additionally rig-i and mda5 have two cards n terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains upon binding of rna with rlr card interacts with mavs mitochondrial adaptor antiviral signal protein leading to activation of the gene coding type 1 interferons ifns type 1 ifns play important roles in coordinating cellular immunity reactions to viral infections thereby contributing to normal antiviral immunity 21in normal conditions virus-infected cells are destroyed by nk cells of the innate immunity and cd8 positive cytolytic t cells of the adaptive immunity using perforin-mediated granulysin secretion this leads to apoptosis of antigen-presenting cells and relevant cytotoxic t cells to avoid unnecessary activation after the antigenic activity is over however if a defect occurs in lymphocyte cytolytic activity whether due to genetic problems or acquired conditions this may lead to the inability of nk and cytolytic cd8 t cells to lyse infected and activated antigen-presenting cells resulting in prolonged and exaggerated interactions between innate and adaptive immune cells in this case many pro-inflammatory cytokines including tnf interferon- il-1 il-6 il-18 and il-33 are secreted in an unrestrained way causing a cytokine storm the whole pathologic process starting with defects in lymphocyte cytolytic activity going on with increased macrophage activity and whole immune system activation resulting in a cytokine storm ards and multiorgan failure is also called as mas 3 22 23 this life-threatening condition is one of the major causes of death in covid-19 patients there is no consensus or suggestion on which terminology should be used cytokine storm mas or shlh we chose to use the term cytokine storm secondary to covid-19 however it would not be irrefutable for anyone to use mas or shlh terminologyamong patients initially reported in wuhan the occurrence of mas cytokine storm and ards were heralded by very high levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and ferritin in the past significantly higher serum levels of il-6 ifn- ccl5 cxcl8 and cxcl-10 were also detected in patients with severe sars-cov or mers-cov infections compared to those with milder infections 24clinical and laboratory features of mas include sustained fever elevated serum ferritin and triglyceride levels pancytopenia fibrinolytic consumptive coagulopathy liver dysfunction and splenomegaly besides low or absent nk cell activity elevated serum levels of scd25 and scd163 and the presence of hemophagocytosis which is defined as the engulfment of blood cells including eryhrocytes leucocytes or platelets by phagocytic cells support the diagnosis of mas 3proposed predisposing factors for mas and cytokine storm secondary to covid-19 infection are discussed belowimpaired viral clearancethe main problem in covid-19 infection is impaired viral clearance like sars-cov and mers-cov infections these viruses have some strategies to combat against host defense mechanisms sars-cov and mers-cov could produce vesicles having double membranes without prrs and to replicate inside these vesicles 25 these strategies lead to impaired antiviral immune response and viral clearance although the pcr test is negative the presence of virus inclusion bodies in pulmonary alveolar cells and macrophages at least for 2 weeks still supports the possibility of a failure of virus clearance 142low levels of type i interferonsanother contributing factor is low levels of type i interferons which are indeed very important in anti-viral response and viral clearance 21 cellular proteins that recognize viral nucleic acids are mediated by stimulating interferons during viral infections recognition of viral rna by mda5 is essential for anti-viral immunity and deficiency of mda5 causes a tendency for viral infections in humans 26 an accessory protein of mers-cov called as 4a binds to double-stranded rna thereby blocking mda5 activation and ifn induction 27 it should be noted that people who died during the 1997 h5n1 influenza outbreak showed lymphoid tissue atrophy associated with high titer circulatory cytokines including il-6 28 similar upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines together with downregulation of antiviral cytokine was observed in mers-cov infection 293increased neutrophil extracellular traps netsneutrophils may kill the invading pathogens including viruses not only through engulfment of microbes the formation of reactive oxygen species degranulation and secretion of antimicrobials but also through formation of nets nets are networks of extracellular fibers primarily composed of dna from neutrophils that bind and kill extracellular pathogens while minimizing damage to the host cells 30 barnes et al suggested that neutrophils may contribute to covid-19 pathogenesis utilizing nets based upon autopsy findings they also suggested that dornase alpha treatment may be beneficial for the management of this infection 31 transfer of dna fragments to extracellular space may be due to the release of mitochondrial dna together with disruption of the plasma membrane or caused by a process known as netosis netosis is a type of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis and necrosis viral rna and proinflammatory cytokines may stimulate the formation of both nets and netosis although the exact role of nets in anti-viral immunity has not been elucidated yet they might contribute to covid-19 pathogenesis 30324miscellaneous other mechanismspyroptosis is a highly inflammatory and caspase-1-dependent form of programmed cell death that occurs most frequently upon infection with intracellular pathogens and is part of the antimicrobial response it has been postulated that pyroptosis with rapid plasma-membrane rupture and release of proinflammatory intracellular contents may also play a role in covid-19 pathogenesis rapid viral replication that causes increased pyroptosis may lead to a massive release of inflammatory mediators 33 34liu et al emphasized the importance of antibodies against spike glycoprotein anti-s-igg as promoters of proinflammatory monocytemacrophage accumulation in the lungs they suggested that viral-specific antibody response may cause pathological changes which may be responsible for virus-mediated lung injury 35 golonka et al speculated that glycoprotein s protein on coronaviruses may undergo a conformational change and enter the host cells through the fc region of igg in other words they proposed a mechanism permitting antibody-dependent enhancement of viral entrance to host cells 32as discussed above the corruption of hem metabolism may be one of the causes of high serum free iron levels and may contribute to inflammation 8 recently iron-mediated cell death known as ferroptosis was reported to play a role in pathogenesis miscellaneous diseases 35 36 the role of ferroptosis in covid-19 pathogenesis and its place as a treatment target should be investigatedtaken together viral escape mechanisms to avoid anti-viral immunity together with genetic or acquired defects in host defense may impair viral clearance resulting in mas and inappropriate immune activation causing ards and multi-organ failure why disease course is variable ranging from asymptomatic to lethal may be explained by genetic and host factors 37 this may also explain why the number of deaths may be high in some families given that genetic factors also play a role in primary hlhmas cases a meta-analysis was performed to analyze both the countries where hlhmas cases are frequently reported and where the frequency of severe and lethal covid-19 infections are high 38 interestingly geographical distributions were found to be similar genetic mutations causing a tendency for primary hlh may constitute a risk factor for severe disease course in covid-19 just the opposite familial mediterranean fever fmf-associated genetic mutations may be speculated to confer milder disease course based upon the historical hypothesis claiming that such mutations may confer resistance to some viral and bacterial pathogens indeed lower death ratios in covid-19 infections reported from turkey and israel may support this speculation based on httpscovid19whointaccessed in 25042020 interestingly mas occurrence is not frequent in fmf despite being an autoinflammatory disease 39besides anti-viral agents treatment of immunologic complications including cytokine storm using appropriate immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs is essential 40 41 currently there is no specific anti-viral agent or vaccine available for covid-19 however there are many drugs most of which are familiar to rheumatologists which are used based on their pharmacological properties corticosteroids cs chloroquine cq hydroxychloroquine hcq il-6r antagonists including tocilizumab tcz il-1 antagonists including anakinra tnf inhibitors and janus kinase inhibitors are among those agents used for this purpose 5 9 on the other hand non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents especially ibuprofen are not recommended in the treatment of covid-19 infection because of the observations that they may exacerbate the symptoms by increasing the ace-2 expression 42these two antimalarial agents are commonly used in rheumatology practice for treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis ra systemic lupus erythematosus sle and sjgrens syndrome based upon their immunomodulatory effects besides anti-malarial effects cq and hcq have been reported to have anti-viral activity against many viruses such as dengue ebola sars and h5n1 in the past recently they were reported also to be useful for covid-19 and were included in the guidelines of many countries including china and italy 4349cq and hcq accumulate in lysosomes and raise the ph level of the endosome which may interfere with virus entry andor exit from host cells 48 besides these two agents may interfere with the ace-2 receptors which sars-cov-2 upregulate their expression and enter the cell by binding to these receptors cq and hcq may reduce glycosylation of ace-2 receptors thereby preventing sars-cov-2 from effectively binding to host cells 48 49 recently wenzhonget al claimed that antimalarials might block the binding of the sars cov-2 virus to porphyrins and thus prevent the entering of the virus to the cell 8 finally they might block the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6 thereby blocking the pathway that subsequently leads to ards whatever the mechanisms are multicenter studies performed in china reported beneficial effects of these agents among patients with covid-19 49 although there are some opposite reports it seems that cq and hcq will remain as main drugs for covid-19one may wonder whether rheumatology patients already receiving hcq may be protected from covid-19 infections recently 22 patients with rheumatic diseases and receiving hcq treatment were reported to have covid-19 infection and one of them died although the results of this study have not been reported yet it seems that prophylactic treatment with hcq may not prevent covid-19 infection twitter trial httpstwittercomrheumcovid we also observed that some of our patients developed covid-19 while receiving hcq but rheumatic patients frequently have co-morbidities and use many other drugs as well also the usual daily dose of hcq is 200 mg which is below the recommended dose for covid-19 therefore we do not recommend prophylactic use of hcq to prevent covid-19 infectioncovid-19 may enter inside the cell by endocytosis and invade the cell ap2-associated protein kinase i aak1 is a member of the numb-associated kinase nak family which serves as a clathrin-mediated endocytosis regulator and aak1 inhibitors may prevent viral entry into the cell 40 50 baricitinib is an inhibitor of the jak-stat pathway which is used for suppressing proinflammatory cytokine production and systemic inflammation in ra baricitinib is also a nak inhibitor with a particularly high affinity for aak 40 51 based upon this basic data stebbing j et al suggested that baricitinib24 mg daily may be combined with antiviral treatment in severe covid-19 infections 40 however inhibition of ifn production as a result of concomitant jak-stat pathway blockage may cause impairment of anti-viral immunity 52 on the other hand tofacitinib cannot inhibit aak1 and is not recommended for this purpose 40 the tendency for general infections and the possibility of diverticulitis are other disadvantages of jak inhibitors 50as mentioned above sars and covid-19 infections may cause mas and cytokine storm t lymphocytes are hyperactivated and there is an enormous amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6 and il-1 which contribute to vascular permeability plasma leakage and dic thereby causing pulmonary damage and ards as well as multi-organ failure 22 cytokine storm and related similar problems are also observed after the chimeric antigen receptor t cell car-t treatment 53tcz is a humanized anti-il-6 receptor antibody inhibiting il-6 tcz is currently used not only for therapy of ra temporal arteritis and many other autoimmune rheumatic diseases 54 but also for the treatment of the cytokine storm which may be induced by car-t treatment 53based on these observations tcz treatment was also tried in patients with severe sars-cov-2 infection complicated with cytokine storm and ards retrospective studies from china reported the resolution of fever and hypoxemia and improvement in serum crp levels and pulmonary ct findings 40 41 5557 our own experience is also consistent with these reports for the treatment of cytokine storm the recommended tcz dose is 8 mgkg iv as single or divided two doses by 1224 h intervalsmaximum dose 800 mg tendency for general infections hepatotoxicity hypertriglyceridemia and the possibility of diverticulitis are the main disadvantages of tcz treatment 58as mentioned above il-1 is another proinflammatory cytokine playing a dominant role in a cytokine storm and sars-cov-2 may cause pyroptosis by il-1 5 anakinra is a recombinant il-1r antagonist rhil-1ra and is the first il-1 blocking biologic agent produced anakinra blocks the binding of both il-1 and il-1 to il-1r thereby inhibits the proinflammatory effects of il-1 59 anakinra was found to be beneficial in patients with severe sepsis without significant adverse effects based upon the data of phase 3 randomized clinical trial 60 the recommended sc adult dose of anakinra ranges from 100 to 200 mg daily to 100 mg three times weekly the pediatric dose is 1 mgkg daily the bioavailability of sc injections is 95with a half-life of 46 h in the presence of renal failure gfr  30 mlmin it should be given in every 2 days hepatic disease does not require dose adjustment unlike tcz anakinra does not inhibit crp synthesis directly therefore serum crp levels can be used to follow up systemic acute phase response 59 another molecule produced for il-blockage is canakinumab which is a high affinity fully humanized monoclonal anti-il-1 antibody with igg1 isotype following sc injection of 150 mg peak serum concentration is achieved in 7 days the recommended dose interval is every 2 months 59 the third molecule developed for il-1 blockade is rilonacept which is a recombinant soluble il-1 receptor the half-life of rilonacept is 6386 days the recommended loading dose is 22 mgkg with the maximum dose of 160 mg the maintenance dose is half of the loading dose weekly 61 the use of canakinumab or rilonacept for severe covid-19 infections has not been reported yettnf- is a key proinflammatory cytokine contributing to various acute and chronic inflammatory pathologies including some autoimmune diseases and septic shock anti-tnf agents are commonly used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis while serum tnf- levels were moderately elevated in patients with sars much higher serum levels were observed in patients with covid-19 infection positively correlated with disease severity although anti-tnf treatment was suggested as a potential treatment for covid-19 there is no sufficient data 40 41systemic corticosteroid cs treatment is controversial in severe ards nevertheless many physicians use this treatment in patients with severe viral ards its use is not recommended for patients with covid-19 based on the data from patients with h1n1 sars and mers 5 international guidelines recommend using moderate doses of systemic cs treatment for a short time only when hemodynamic parameters are not improved following fluid replacement and vasopressor support 40 41 current use of systemic corticosteroid treatment during covid-19 infection is limited to patients having lethal complications related to cytokine storm such as ards acute cardiac injury renal failure and to those patients with higher serum levels of d-dimer since there is no positive evidence coming from randomized clinical trials who guideline dated march 13 2020 does not recommend using systemic cs treatment for patients with covid-19 routinely 62 in our opinion methylprednisolone 40 mg once daily for 45 days in addition to tcz treatment may be helpful during cytokine storm and may also help to avoid rebound after tczivig contains the pooled polyclonal immunoglobulin g igg supplied from the plasma of approximately a thousand or more healthy blood donors in clinical practice ivig is used in patients with immune deficiencies for the treatment of infectious diseases as well as in treatment-resistant patients with autoimmune diseases as an immunomodulatory agent previous favorable experience from patients with sars and mers suggested the use of a high dose of ivig 0305 gkg in patients with serious covid-19 infection in the early phase of the disease 63 64 anticoagulation and hydration should not be overlooked for increased tendency to thrombosis during ivig treatment for covid-19 patientscolchicine is an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agent commonly used for the treatment of gout fmf and behets syndrome for a long time colchicine was suggested to be useful for the treatment of some complications of covid-19 infection based on its ability to inhibit il-1 production 41 colcorona colchicine coronavirus sars-cov2 trial is a phase 3 multi-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of colchicine in adult patients diagnosed with covid-19 infection and have at least one high-risk criterion currently the results of this study have not been reported yet clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04322682many other drugs and interventions were also proposed for the treatment of covid-19 and its complications the use of low molecular weight heparin lmwh or unfractionated heparin at doses indicated for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism strongly advised in all covid-19 patients hospitalized if patients have a contraindication for anticoagulation they should be treated with lower limb compression 65for the prevention and treatment of cytokine storm and possible lung fibrosis after covid-19 pneumonia mesenchymal stem cells mscs-based immunomodulation treatment has been proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach for this purpose many studies are currently ongoing 66 leng et al concluded that iv transplantation of mscs was safe and effective in patients with covid-19 pneumonia especially for those in critically severe conditions 67 however currently there are no approved msc-based approaches for the prevention andor treatment of covid-19 patients but the first results of clinical trials seem promisingimmune plasma transfusion which is a passive immunization way is an old method used in the treatment of many infections experience with sars-cov infection showed that this treatment could work when given to the appropriate patient or even to family members caring for covid-19 patients at home 68 however based upon the experience from sars-cov and mers-cov infections there is a risk of antibody-mediated disease enhancement after hyperimmune globulin transfusion 69in this short review the relation between pandemic covid-19 infection and its immunologic complication mas was briefly debated the mechanisms involved in cytokine storm development and why this complication occurs in some patients during covid-19 infection were discussed and possible therapies reviewed this study has some limitations firstly the literature about covid is changing at great speed and the chinese literature could not be included in the manuscript the lack of standard published studies and the differences in the treatment approaches between chinese and western sources such as chinese medicine remained an obstacle for making correct recommendationsalthough sars-cov-2 infections may be asymptomatic or cause only mild symptoms in most of the cases immunologic complications such as mas and cytokine storm may occur in some cases impairment of sars-cov-2 clearance due to genetic and viral features lower levels of interferons increased neutrophil extracellular traps and netosis and increased pyroptosis create a background for such complications the presence of genetic mutations causing a tendency for primary hlh may constitute a risk factor for severe disease course in covid-19once immunologic complications like mashlh occur anti-viral treatment alone is not enough and should be combined with appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment early recognition and appropriate treatment of mas and cytokine storm will decrease the morbidity and mortality in covid-19 infection which requires the collaboration of infectious disease lung and intensive care unit specialists with other experts such as immunologists rheumatologists and hematologiststhe fast-growing outbreak of 2019 novel coronaviruses sars-cov-2 which originated from china at the beginning of december 2019 reached all continents except the antarctica in merely three months as for march 7th 2020 more than 100000 infected patients and more than 3500 death cases have been documented worldwide especially severe sars-cov-2 infection covid-19 has a bad clinical outcome and some reports emphasized the role of cytokine storm and dysfunctions of multiple organs1 2 3 however the etiology of severe covid-19 has been largely unknownsimilar as sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 is also thought derived from bat coronaviruses4 however all these coronaviruses in addition to other human fatal virus such as ebola and marburg are not pathogenic for bat at all one major reason is that free dna in cytoplasm or blood cannot bring up violent immune response in bat however free dna can produce severe inflammations in human mediated by klrcklrd family of natural killer cell receptors mhc class i genes and type i interferons and some dna sensors5 6 thus cytokine storm in human therefore i hypothesized that the damage induced by free dna is a reason for severe covid-19free dna is produced by dying cells in healthy subjects white blood cells are the major source of free dna while in cancer it is usually from tumor cells free dna in covid-19 patients can be brought up by both injured lung cells lymphocytes and other immune cells more than 60 of covid-19 patients had lymphopenia1 2 3 which produced abundant free dna in these patients free dna is then circulated into many tissues and activated various tissue cells to produce a large amount of cytokines5 6 thus risk for cytokine storm in addition to these cytokines free dna can also destroy vascular endothelial cells directly7
in vitro study showed it can harm human umbilical vein endothelial cells the damage of endothelial cells will boost the dysfunctions of multiple organs by cytokine storm as described as follow meanwhile cytokine storm will also promote the permeability of blood vessels level of lymphocytes is thought as the early identification of risk factors for severe covid-192 3 while i hypothesized that it was related to free dna-related cytokine storm and blood vessel damage which can explain many symptoms of this disease including some special symptoms in covid-19 as shown in figure 1
other immune cells can also be the source of free dna for example the alveolar macrophages are significantly increased filled and activated in the alveolar cavities in the covid-19 patients with ards9 which can produce a large amount of free dna and cytokines in addition the neutrophil extracellular traps nets an important pathogenic components of neutrophils also have a large amount of free dna myeloperoxidase-dna complexes histones and enzymes the level of nets was reported contributed to lung injury and was correlated with severity of h7n9 and h1n1 infections10
there are some risk factors for severe covid-19 such as hypertension diabetes cardiovascular diseases1 2 3 all of which have previous vascular damages i thought that the blood vessels in these patients are more vulnerable for free dna-induced damage then these patients have more chances to be admitted to the icu and death moreover above underlying diseases are also risk factors for severe sars which also showed some characteristics of cytokine storm11
some clinical outcomes of severe covid-19 can be explained by free dna-induced damage acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is a major cause of death which can be developed from interstitial pneumonia commonly found in covid-1912 both interstitial pneumonia and ards can be boosted by endothelial cells damage all the pulmonary pathological tests of covid-19 patients showed significant damages of vessel walls and infiltration of inflammatory cells in pulmonary alveoli while with fewer invasion of sars-cov-2 compared to sars-cov and mers-cov13 ards is commonly seen in sever covid-19 patients because of the following reasons first lung has a large total area of capillary bed thus prone to vessels damage and cytokine storm induced by free dna second higher content of oxygen in lung vessels can form more 8-oxodg the product of free dna then brought up more serious harm to lung vessels6 third sars-cov-2 directly invade into and destroy pulmonary epithelial cells by ace2 receptor14
sticky mucus plug in alveoli and bronchioles is a special feature of severe covid-19 patients this is an important reason for poor prognosis of severe covid-19 in addition to a large cell debris produced by cytokine storm i thought that there were high content of free dna in inflammatory exudationa in alveoli and bronchioles which is very sticky and is easy to bound to cell debris and fibrin thus the formation of mucus plugcompared to patients not in icu those in icu have more higher prevalence of shock1 2 3 which involves the dysfunction of microvascular endothelial cells and large effusion of liquid from circulation into tissues in addition acute injuries of heart liver and kidney where have abundant blood flow was also prone to occur in these severe covid-19 patients1 2 3 sars-cov-2 were not extensively found in above organs in severe covid-19 patients by autopsy meanwhile there were obvious damage of vessles inflammation and edema of these organs13 moreover the increase of vascular permeability will accelerate the damage of cytokines therefore these fatal complications in covid-19 were caused at least partly by free dna-induced vessels damage and cytokine storm but not only by the virus itselfacute injuries of liver and kidney are also usually seen in severe sars patients11 taken together with cytokine storm similar risk factors and complications in the infections of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 it implied that free-induced vascular damages and cytokine storm may play pivotal roles in the infections of these fatal coronavirusesbrain is another organ with abundant blood flow which showed congestion and edema in autopsy of severe covid-19 patients additionally drowsiness and convulsions can be seen in some children patients these phenomena can also be explained by free-dna induced vessel damage and inflammationonce the vascular endothelial cells damaged the coagulation system is activated thrombocytopenia higher pro-thrombin time and d-dimer level are more common in severe covid-19 patients1 2 3 it implied that there were more severe damages of vascular endothelial cells in severe patients compared to mild patients consistently there were some microthrombus in many organs and obvious hemorrage in lung found by autopsy of severe patients the microthrombus and hemorrage of above organs can further disturb their functions i want to compare covid-19 to the infection of ebola another fatal virus from bat which also has immune suppression and a systemic inflammatory response that causes impairment of the vascular and coagulation leading to severe hemorrhage multiorgan failure and shock15 i thought that there also is free dna-induced vascular damage and inflammation in the infection of ebola which usually cannot be compensated by coagulation systemfree dna is relative resistant to the endonuclease action16 so the free dna from both dead lung cells and lymphocytes can be accumulated in blood to a certain extent then induce the damage of covid-19 patients rapidly and violently it can explain the following strange phenomenon first compared to sars and mers patients with covid-19 usually had a comparative long interval from disease onset to dyspnoea but they were suddenly worsening and had some severe symptoms shortly such as ards admission to mechanical ventilation and to icu1 2 3 importantly these symptoms averagely not before day 12 in non-surviors17 is usually happened when the viral shedding is already decreasing its peak time at about day 6 in severe covid-19 patients it can be easily explained by the accumulation of free dna in blood when it is extended to a threshold significant vessels damage and cytokine storm will be produced in addition guan et al reported that about half of patients have no fever at admission to hospital but most of them will develop a fever during hospital2 i thought that the delayed fever was partly due to an increasing level of free dna in addition to the amplification of the virus third many clinicians found that some severe covid-19 patients have experienced two or more attack even after viral load was reduced i thought that some attack was due to direct invasion by the virus while the others might be due to the cytokine storm or vessel damage induced by free dna most surprisingly some discharged patients with improved ct results and continuous twice negative tests of nucleic acids were found to return to positive tests of nucleic acids 18 it implied that the load of virus increased after they were discharged from hospital this phenomenon is not seen in sars and mers free dna is related to the continues activation and use up of immune cells19 i thought that comparative high level of free dna in some discharged patients will eventually suppress immune function and cause the amplification of viruslastly but not least antiviral drugs usually are helpful in mild patients but not in many severe patients1 2 3 because of free dna-induced cytokine storm and vessel damage however plasmapheresis may be an effective treatment11 at lest partly due to clearing of some free dnaconclusively i thought that free dna-induced damage play a pivotal role in the etiology of cytokine storm in severe covid-19 so free dna might be a useful biomarker of severe covid-19 further investigations of free dna-induced damage in the infections of sars and ebola are warranted
8in december 2019 an outbreak of pneumonia cases was reported in wuhan china the outbreak was linked to the huanan food market the new virus 2019-ncov so called then was isolated on 7 january 2020 and identified as the cause of the outbreak 1 the 2019-ncov virus rapidly spread across china and many other countries and caused a rapidly growing global outbreak on 11 february 2020 the who has named the disease covid-19 short for coronavirus disease 2019 2 and on 12 march 2020 the total number of covid-19 confirmed cases reached 125260 globally with 80981 cases in china and 44279 outside of china and the covid-19 was declared to be a pandemic by the who 3 as of 26 may 2020 covid-19 has been confirmed in 5404512 individuals globally with deaths reaching 343514 with a morality of 64 the united states had the highest number of confirmed cases 1618757 cases 4covid-19 is caused by the sars-cov-2 that belongs to the beta-coronaviruses subfamily coronaviruses are enveloped positive single stranded large rna viruses although the first data available about covid-19 indicates possible animal-to-human transmission via wild animals in huanan seafood market in wuhan 5 6 epidemiological data and studies after that have increasingly demonstrated that the virus transmits human-to-human through droplets or direct contact with the reporting that individuals who did not have direct contact with the huanan seafood market were diagnosed with covid-19 and with secondary cases occurring at hospitals among health care workers who had extensive contact with covid-19 patients the virus was confirmed to spread through respiratory droplets from coughs or sneezes 79 with the ability of the host to shed the infection while asymptomatic 10 studies are now also proposing the possible feco-oral transmission of the virus 11covid-19 patients are mainly adults older than 18 years old with a male predominance the preconceived notion that pediatrics are not subjected to infection later changed with confirmed cases occurring in pediatrics in china and worldwide 12 13 however mortality is still much more in the adult group above the age of 65 years adults with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases respiratory diseases endocrine diseases diabetics or immunocompromised adults remain the most exposed to serious complication of covid-19 14although many patients of covid-19 remain asymptomatic some patients get pneumonia and 10 of cases require mechanical ventilation and icu admission patients usually present with fever dry cough shortness of breath headache malaise muscle and bony aches less common symptoms include sore throat confusion productive cough hemoptysis diarrhea nausea and chest pain 15 progression to pneumonia is documented by radiological findings and usually occurs 12 weeks after the beginning of the symptoms signs of pneumonia include decreased oxygen saturation deterioration of blood gas multi-focal glass ground opacities or patchysegmental consolidation in chest x-ray or ct patients presenting late or deteriorating hospitalized patients usually suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome ards acute respiratory failure acute renal injury and multi-organ failure 1517complete blood picture of covid-19 patients usually shows lymphopenia with or without total leukopenia a lymphocyte count 10  109l has been associated with severe disease 18 a recent research has reported that severe cases of covid-19 tend to have higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio nlr nlr is calculated from a routine blood picture by dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count and indicates a patients overall inflammatory status increasing nlr is a risk factor of mortality not only in infectious diseases but also in malignancy acute coronary syndrome intracerebral hemorrhage polymyositis and dermatomyostis 19 platelet count is usually normal or mildly decreased c-reaction protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are usually increased while procalcitonin levels are normal and elevation of procalcitonin usually indicates secondary bacterial infection lactate dehydrogenase ferritin d-dimer and creatine kinase elevation is associated with severe disease elevation in creatinine or liver enzyme levels alt and ast occurs in complicated cases progressing to multi-organ failure 18the newly emerging covid-19 is continuing to challenge medical health systems all over the world and the scenario is still getting worse the covid-19 poses an increasing threat to humans with a fatality rate of 64  so far 4 covid-19 infection is accompanied by an aggressive inflammatory response with the release of a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines in an event known as cytokine storm the host immune response to the sars-cov-2 virus is hyperactive resulting in an excessive inflammatory reaction several studies analyzing cytokine profiles from covid-19 patients suggested that the cytokine storm correlated directly with lung injury multi-organ failure and unfavorable prognosis of severe covid-19 16 2024the immune system has an exquisite mechanism capable of responding to various pathogens normal anti-viral immune response requires the activation of the inflammatory pathways of the immune system however aberrant or exaggerated response of the hosts immune system can cause severe disease if remains uncontrolled 25 cytokines are an essential part of the inflammatory process cytokines are produced by several immune cells including the innate macrophages dendritic cells natural killer cells and the adaptive t and b lymphocytes during an innate immune response to a viral infection pattern recognition receptors prrs recognize different molecular structures that are characteristic to the invading virus these molecular structures are referred to as pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps binding of pamps to prrs triggers the start of the inflammatory response against the invading virus resulting in the activation of several signaling pathways and subsequently transcription factors which induce the expression of genes responsible for production of several products involved in the hosts immune response to the virus among which are the genes encoding several pro-inflammatory cytokines the major transcription factors that are activated by prrs are nuclear factor kb activation protein 1 interferon response factors three and seven these transcription factors induce the expression of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines chemokines and adhesion molecules this sequence of events results in recruitment of leukocytes and plasma proteins to site of infection where they perform various effector functions that serve to combat the triggering infection 26three of the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines of the innate immune response are il-1 tnf-  and il-6 tissue macrophages mast cells endothelial and epithelial cells are the major source of these cytokines during innate immune response the cytokine storm results from a sudden acute increase in circulating levels of different pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6 il-1 tnf-  and interferon this increase in cytokines results in influx of various immune cells such as macrophages neutrophils and t cells from the circulation into the site of infection with destructive effects on human tissue resulting from destabilization of endothelial cell to cell interactions damage of vascular barrier capillary damage diffuse alveolar damage multiorgan failure and ultimately death lung injury is one consequence of the cytokine storm that can progress into acute lung injury or its more severe form ards 27 ards leading to low oxygen saturation levels is a major cause of mortality in covid-19 although the exact mechanism of ards in covid-19 patients is not fully understood the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is considered to be one of the major contributing factors 1517accumulating evidence suggests that some patients with severe covid-19 suffer from a cytokine storm analysis of cytokine levels in plasma of 41 covid-19 confirmed cases in china revealed elevated levels of il-1 il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 fgf g-csf gm-csf ifn- ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a mip1-b pdgf tnf- and vegf in both patients admitted to the icu and non-icu patients compared to healthy adults all patients included in the study had pneumonia and 13 of the patients were admitted to icu and six of these patients died 16a multicenter retrospective study of 150 covid-19 patients in china evaluated predictors of mortality for covid-19 the study analyzed data from 82 cases who resolved from covid-19 and 68 cases who died from covid-19 and reported significantly higher levels of il-6 in mortality cases than resolving cases 20 another study analyzing data from 21 patients in china reported increased levels of il-10 il-6 and tnf- in severe cases n  11 patients compared to moderate cases n  10 patients 21 a similar study by gao et al assessed 43 patients in china and reported that levels of il-6 were significantly higher in severe cases n  15 than in mild cases n  28 22 similarly chen et al studied a total of 29 covid-19 patients divided into three groups according to relevant diagnostic criteria and found that il-6 was higher in critical cases n  5 patients than in severe cases n  9 patients and that il-6 was higher in severe cases than in mild cases n  15 cases 23no much data is available yet regarding severe pediatric covid-19 patients a study that evaluated eight critically ill chinese pediatric covid-19 patients treated in the icu with ages ranging from 2 months to 15 years reported increased levels of il-6 il-10 and ifn- among other laboratory findings 24cytokine storm cs is a critical life-threating condition requiring intensive care admission and having a quite high mortality cs is characterized by a clinical presentation of overwhelming systemic inflammation hyperferritinemia hemodynamic instability and multi-organ failure and if left untreated it leads to death the trigger for cs is an uncontrolled immune response resulting in continuous activation and expansion of immune cells lymphocytes and macrophages which produce immense amounts of cytokines resulting in a cytokine storm the cs clinical findings are attributed to the action of the proinflammatory cytokines like il-1 il-6 il-18 ifn- and tnf- 27cs has been reported in several viral infections including influenza h5n1 virus 28 29 influenza h1n1 virus 30 and the two coronaviruses highly related to covid-19 sars-cov and mers-cov 31 32 both pro-inflammatory cytokines eg il-1 il-6 and tnf- and anti-inflammatory cytokines eg il-10 and il-1 receptor antagonist are elevated in the serum of cs patients the main contributors to the interplay of the cytokine storm are il-6 and tnf- in the absence of an immediate and appropriate therapeutic intervention patients develop ards as a result of acute lung damage followed by multi-organ failure and resulting in death hence the cs should be treated immediately otherwise mortality can result 28 in addition to anti-viral therapies that can directly target the virus anti-inflammatory therapies that diminish the cytokine responses are suggested to decrease both the morbidity and mortality in covid-19 patientsthe early recognition of cs and the prompt treatment can lead to better outcome several biological agents targeting cytokines have been proposed for treating cs il-1 receptor antagonist anakinra which is used in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was proven to be helpful in cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis a disease associated with severe cs 33 tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized il-6 receptor antagonist that interferes with il-6 binding to its receptor and blocks signaling tocilizumab is used in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis juvenile idiopathic arthritis giant cell arteritis and has proven valuable in treatment of cs triggered by car-t cell therapy for hematological malignancies 34 downstream inhibitors of cytokines eg jak inhibitors are also being explored in treating csas il-6 is the most frequently reported cytokine to be increased in covid-19 patients and as il-6 elevated levels have been associated to higher mortalities tocilizumab is a candidate drug to be used in managing the cytokine storm accompanying covid-19 encouraging results have been reported in china where tocilizumab was used in treatment of 21 patients with severe and critical covid-19 clinical data showed that the symptoms hypoxygenmia and ct opacity changes were improved immediately after the treatment with tocilizumab in most of the patients suggesting that tocilizumab could be an efficient therapeutic agent for treatment of the cytokine storm associated with covid-19 35 the us food and drug administration fda has approved roches phase iii clinical trial of the use of tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia the trial is planned to include 330 patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia 36cytokine storm appears to be one of the common causes of mortality in the recently declared pandemic of covid-19 therapeutic approaches to manage the covid-19 cytokine storm might provide an avenue to decrease the covid-19 associated morbidity and mortality and is the focus of upcoming studiesall authors contributed to gathering of data writing editing and revising of the manuscriptthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestimmune responses clinical presentations and radiological patterns are quite
heterogeneous among the multitude of people affected by the widespread
covid-19 syndrome1 one of the worst scenarios is sustained by the so-called cytokine
storm historically labelled as secondary haemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis shlh which is a complication most commonly
encountered in viral infections2 influenza viruses ebola virus cytomegalovirus and more recently
sars-cov-2 have been implicated in triggering the cytokine storm3 this cytokine storm may provide the possible mechanism on why certain
sub-populations are more likely to die of covid-19 than otherswhen the immune system mounts an effective adaptive response against
sars-cov-2 the infection can be cleared and clinical manifestations are
absent or prone to complete recovery this successful result is mediated by
an antiviral cd4 t helper th cell commitment associated with
activation of cd8 cytotoxic t lymphocytes and with a b
cell-driven response leading to the production of specific antibodies4 however when the human organism fails to develop an adequate
adaptive immune reaction viral persistence and the consequent prolongation
and amplification of innate immune mechanisms associated with dysfunctional
adaptive responses can cause a hyperinflammatory state underlying the
cytokine storm typical of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards5 in other words the massive and continuous release of proinflammatory
cytokines and chemokines is responsible for a severe even deadly attack
against the lung besides the comorbidities respiratory cardiovascular
metabolic oncologic etc involved the senescence of the immune system
plays a role in the worst outcomes observed in the elderly67
during childhood and adolescence there are instead very high numbers of
nave t lymphocytes ready to differentiate and to engage a successful fight
against eventual new pathogens5 indeed children are currently paying a very low death toll to
sars-cov-2 infectionon the basis of the above considerations the present review will focus on the
pathogenic mechanisms underpinning the lung damage induced by the cytokine
storm triggered by sars-cov-2 as well as on potential therapies targeting
such a very severe conditionsars-cov-2 is an enveloped positive-sense and single-stranded rna
-coronavirus similar to coronaviruses responsible for severe acute
respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome
mers89 its nucleocapsid consists of genomic rna and a
phosphorylated n protein which is embedded within phospholipid
bilayers and surfaced by two spike proteins10 the latter include the spike glycoprotein trimmer s and the
hemagglutinin-esterase ne among which the type iii transmembrane
glycoprotein m and the envelope e protein are interposed10 the s glycoprotein binds to the cell membrane receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 expressed within the lower
respiratory tract by type 2 alveolar epithelial cells1112 this key
function of s glycoprotein is primed by tmprss2 a human type 2
transmembrane serine protease which thus facilitates virus entry into
host cells11 the s glycoprotein comprises a s1 subunit mediating the
cellular tropism of sars-cov-2 and a s2 subunit that is responsible
for virus-cell membrane fusion13 this fusion is followed by penetration of viral genomic rna
into the cytoplasm once inside target cells single-stranded viral
rna is recognised by the intracellular toll-like receptor 7 tlr7
located in endosomes14 as a consequence of this infectious process sars-cov-2 rna
drives the translation and assembly of viral proteins inside the
endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus the newly formed vesicles
which contain viral particles fuse with cell membrane thus releasing
the virustissue destruction spreads throughout sars-cov-2-infected cells which
trigger innate immune responses mediated mostly by macrophages
indeed tight intercellular communications occur between
ace2-expressing lung epithelial cells and macrophages15 within the context of class i major histocompatibility complex
mhc-i macrophages present viral antigens to t lymphocytes thereby
leading to t cell subset commitment and activation16 the subsequent th1-featured adaptive immune response should
contribute to clear viral infection via the release
of antiviral cytokines such as type i interferons ifns however it
has been previously reported that severe infections caused by sars
coronavirus may be associated with low levels of ifn production17 therefore this pathobiologic scenario could be characterised
by polarisation towards an aberrant t cell lineage and a dysregulated
cytokine secretory patternindeed it has been shown recently that sars-cov-2 infection can prime
cd4 t lymphocytes to differentiate into pathogenic
th1 cells secreting high amounts of interleukin-6 il-6 and
granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor gm-csf figure 118 such a cytokine milieu promotes activation of cd14
cd16 monocytes which in turn release il-6 and may
migrate from blood to lung thus possibly becoming alveolar
macrophages or dendritic cells figure 118 in addition severely ill covid-19 patients develop
dysfunctional immunophenotypes of cd4 and cd8
t lymphocytes characterised by a high co-expression of surface
markers such as pd-1 programmed cell death protein-1 and tim-3
t-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 which
predisposes to a rapid t cell exhaustion during viral
infections1922 in fact in patients with severe disease
innate immune mechanisms can fail to induce an effective
virus-targeted cytotoxic response normally implemented by activated
cd8 cells23 furthermore the adaptive immune response induced by sars-cov-2
might be also shaped as a predominant th17 profile24cross-talking innate and adaptive immune pathways lead lung epithelial
cells activated monocytesmacrophages and t lymphocytes to massively
release a broad array of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines

sars-cov-2-induced tlr-7 signalling is il-6 a pleiotropic
proinflammatory mediator that promotes the proliferation of myeloid
progenitor cells and the growth and activation of leukocytes as well
as induces pyrexia and the synthesis of acute phase proteins such as c
reactive protein crp figure 225 il-6 plays a central role in immune responses by stimulating
the differentiation of t follicular helper cells tfh and
contributing together with tgf- to development of th17 cells figure
2524 through activation of the socs-3 suppressor of
cytokine signalling-3 pathway il-6 can also suppress phosphorylation
of signal transducer and activator of transcription-4 stat-4 thus
impairing the activity of cd8 cytotoxic and natural killer
t cells525 furthermore
via up-regulation of il-4 and down-regulation
of ifn- il-6 inhibits antiviral th1 cell commitment and favours th2
cell differentiation5 elevated levels of il-6 are associated with severe lung injury26 il-6 can suppress the functions of t lymphocytes dendritic
cells and macrophages aimed to eliminate coronaviruses thereby
dampening the ability of the immune system to clear such infections27 therefore il-6 overproduction can probably be induced by some
viruses such as sars-cov-2 with the aim of escaping immune

proteolytic enzyme operating within the context of the multiprotein
intracellular inflammasome complex28 highly susceptible to activation induced by viral molecules
il-1 and tnf- mostly generated by activated macrophages are
present in high concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf
from patients with ards and stimulate neutrophil functions2931 tnf- also
causes the apoptotic death of lung epithelial and endothelial cells32high il-8 balf concentrations have been also detected in subjects with ards31 il-8 is a powerful chemoattractant and activator of
neutrophils whose apoptosis is inhibited by this chemokine thus
upon release from monocytesmacrophages and alveolar epithelial cells
il-8 plays a key role in stimulating neutrophil survival and
recruitment to the lungs31 il-8 synthesis is effectively stimulated by il-17a and il-17f
secreted by il-6-dependent th17 cells which are likely involved in
triggering the cytokine storm associated with lung neutrophilic infiltration24 indeed high numbers of th17 lymphocytes can be found in
peripheral blood of patients with severe sars-cov-2 infection33with regard to inflammatory cell influx into sars-cov-2-infected lungs a
key pathologic function is also exerted by gm-csf which mediates
relevant intercellular communications between pathogenic th1 cells and
cd14 cd16 monocytes figure 118 high numbers of cd14 cd16 monocytes are
detectable in covid-19 patients with severe involvement of lungs
where these cells actively participate in induction and amplification
of tissue infiltration by macrophages18another proinflammatory mediator potentially involved in the
cytokinechemokine storm characterising severe sars-cov-2 infection is
the chemokine ip-10 in fact it has been previously shown that ip-10
is up-regulated in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells as well
as in t cells and monocytesmacrophages infiltrating the lungs of
subjects with sars30 ip-10 exerts a strong chemotactic action on t lymphocytes
monocytes and natural killer cells30 moreover high blood levels of ip-10 were detected in patients
died of sars34 it is thus very likely that ip-10 significantly contributes to
the recruitment of monocytesmacrophages into the lungs of sars
patients virus-induced production of ip-10 could also be responsible
for a fast mobilisation followed by a subsequent apoptosis of t cells30 this mechanism might be implicated in the impairment of t
lymphocyte response against sars-cov-2taken together the above considerations suggest that in critically ill
covid-19 patients cytokine storm and cytokine dysregulation lead to
remarkable pathological consequences indeed the cytokine storm
elicits immunological changes that can potentially weaken the immune
response aimed to clear sars-cov-2 infection t lymphocyte-dependent
protective responses against sars-cov-2 mediated by both
cd4 and cd8 t cells may potentially
fail because of the overproduction of il-6 and tnf- in fact these
cytokines can inhibit t cell proliferation and activation thereby
contributing to the development of lymphopenia in severely injured
sars-cov-2 infected patients1618 consistent with such a speculation it has been
reported that high levels of both il-6 and tnf- coexist with
relatively low counts of cd4 and cd8 t cells21 it has been also hypothesised that a suppression of
functionally exhausted th1 lymphocytes might be concomitant with an
immunological shift towards th2-driven responses116 all the
above immunological changes likely occur more often in the elderly
because of a negative impact of aging on the protective efficiency
afforded by the adaptive immune network against new viral infections6cytokinechemokine-mediated injury of lung endothelial and epithelial
cells may impair the integrity of bloodair barrier thereby promoting
vascular permeability as well as alveolar oedema infiltration by
inflammatory cells ie neutrophils and macrophages and hypoxia32 in addition the presence within the cytokine storm context of
fibrogenic factors such as tgf- could favour tissue remodelling and
lung fibrosis30 thus further compromising gas exchangein clinical setting there is an urgent need to detect the laboratory
parameters which can be useful to diagnose cytokine storm a recent
meta-analysis of 21 studies globally including 3377 patients and 33
laboratory biomarkers suggests that elevated serum levels of il-6 and
ferritin paralleled by high numbers of white blood cells and associated
with low lymphocyte and platelet counts could provide a valuable diagnostic
platform for critical covid-19 illness35 such data are partially consistent with those of a very recent
explorative study carried out on 127 hospitalised covid-19 patients which
showed that when compared with the group of less severe subjects more
severe patients were characterised by high blood levels of il-6 fibrinogen
sialic acid crp and neutrophils36 in particular neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio nlr resulted to be
significantly higher in severely ill patients36 thus suggesting that the decreased lymphocyte count might be
indicative of the existing impairment of the immune systeman effective inhibitor of il-6 pathogenic action within the context of
sars-cov-2-induced cytokine storm appears to be tocilizumab a
recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody targeting the il-6 receptor
currently utilised for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis3839 a
retrospective chinese study performed in 21 severely ill covid-19
patients showed that tocilizumab safely lowered fever and crp as
well as improving hypoxemia and computed tomography ct scan lung lesions40 on the basis of these positive results a randomised controlled
trial has been approved in china with the aim of testing tocilizumab
in subjects with elevated il-6 levels and interstitial pneumonia chictr20000297653 tocilizumab is also undergoing clinical investigation in italy
trial tocivid-19  nct04317092 current chinese and italian
guidelines recommend the use of tocilizumab for treatment of covid-19 infection16 in particular italian guidelines suggest that tocilizumab
should be utilised in patients with interstitial pneumonia and severe
respiratory failure characterised by high blood levels of il-6 or crpd-dimerfibrinogenferritin16 a further phase iii clinical trial has been approved by the
united states food and drug administration fda to evaluate
tocilizumab in hospitalised covid-19 patients suffering from severe
pneumonia clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04320615 however the
use of tocilizumab raises some concerns indeed it is possible that
the high viral load that drives the cytokine storm would be
unsuppressed by the use of tocilizumab furthermore although
tocilizumab seems to be usually quite safe and well tolerated it has
been reported that the infusion of this drug can occasionally be
associated with the occurrence of liver damage thrombocytopenia
leukopenia serious infections gastrointestinal perforations
hypertension skin reactions and anaphylaxis41 another il-6 receptor antagonist is sarilumab already licensed
for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and currently undergoing a
phase iiiii clinical trial enrolling severely ill hospitalised
covid-19 patients clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct0431529842anakinra is a recombinant antagonist of human il-1 receptor that appears
to be capable of improving the survival of septic patients with
macrophage activation syndrome mas43 in particular in 43 septic patients with mas and concomitant
disseminated intravascular coagulation hepatobiliary dysfunction
cytopenias and hyperferritinemia when compared with placebo anakinra
treatment significantly improved the 28-day survival rate anakinra
654 placebo 35343inhibitors of jakstat signal transducers and activators of
transcription signalling pathways such as baricitinib a drug that is
currently utilised to treat rheumatoid arthritis can be potentially
useful for treatment of cytokine storm indeed by targeting the
jakstat signal transduction system baricitinib interferes with the
functions of adaptor-associated protein kinase 1 akk1 and cyclin
g-associated kinase gak which are implicated in viral endocytosis44 fedratinib is a specific jak2 inhibitor able to reduce il-17
expression as well as to repress gm-csf biological actions24 therefore this drug could contribute to attenuate the cytokine
storm associated with severe sars-cov-2 infection another jak
inhibitor is ruxolitinib a drug that is currently utilised for
treatment of myelofibrosis ruxolitinib has been shown to induce
relevant clinical benefits in some covid-19 patients treated in
southern italy unpublished observations however further studies
are needed to corroborate and validate such positive preliminary
datathe use of systemic corticosteroids for treatment of covid-19-associated
cytokine storm could be of some value in fact by modulating cytokine
production these drugs might repress hyperinflammation associated
with covid-19-related ards45 some interesting observations suggest that in
community-acquired pneumonia corticosteroids could increase the rate
of therapeutic success and also decrease the number of
hospitalisation days and the time occurring to reach clinical stability46 however it has been reported that early use of hydrocortisone
in subjects with mers could delay viral clearance47 moreover utilisation of methylprednisolone in sars-cov-2
infected patients with advanced ards and progressive disease appears
to ameliorate respiratory symptoms and ct abnormalities but does not
seem to prolong overall survival4849 nevertheless because of the lack of control
arms such conclusions based on observational studies should be
considered with extreme cautionchloroquine and especially its less toxic derivative hydroxychloroquine
could block sars-cov-2 entry inside target cells by interfering with
glycosylation of ace2 receptors50 this drug also acts by suppressing tlr7 signalling and by
inhibiting endosomal acidification essential for viral replication5 moreover hydroxychloroquine prevents endolysosomal fusion the
therapeutic action of hydroxychloroquine can be potentiated by
azithromycin capable of reducing the pro-inflammatory activity of
il-6 and tnf-5152the dramatic outbreak of sars-cov-2 infection is currently associated with an
ongoing progress in the knowledge of underlying pathogenic mechanisms which
is shedding partial light on the immunophenotypic traits characterising
infected patients more susceptible to the development of heavy lung damage
caused by cytokine storm indeed an impairment in anti-viral immune
response and the concurrent aberrant hyperinflammatory reaction can
facilitate especially in elderly people with comorbid conditions the
occurrence of the most severe forms of covid-19-related illness a better
understanding of cytokine storm pathobiology is also making it possible to
explore the therapeutic efficacy of il-6 receptor antagonists and jakstat
inhibitors which however require to be carefully evaluated by definitely
needed randomised controlled trialsin december 2019 the emergency of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in wuhan china posed a serious and urgent threat to the medical and health public in the world 1 on 11 february 2020 the world health organization who officially named 2019ncov as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and the disease caused by it as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 on 30 january 2020 the who declared covid-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern then on march 11 who made an assessment that covid-19 can be characterized as a pandemic it is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus emerged rapidly since sars-cov in 2003 and mers-cov in 20122 which made public health care institutions around the world face greater challengessars-cov-2 showed a similar pattern of infection clinical features and even faster transmission rate 3 than the two coronaviruses have already erupted 4 however it is of particular attention that acute lung injury ali systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs or acute respiratory distress syndrome ards occur in sars-cov or mers-cov infected patients as well as in severe patients with covid-195 cytokines have been found that play a key role in driving the appearance of these clinical features and are also at the core of inflammation development 6 7 consistent with the previous findings severe covid-19 patients showed significantly increased in cytokines such as il2 il7 il10 gscf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf with the characteristics of a cytokine storm 8 when sars-cov-2 infects the body the inflammatory response plays an antiviral role but the strong cytokine storm due to the unbalanced response will make a huge damage on patients therefore taking some strategies to suppress effectively the cytokine storm is an essential way to prevent the deterioration of patients with covid-19 and save the patients lives which is of great significance for the treatment of critically ill patients and reducing the mortality rate in this review sars-cov-2 and the occurrence mechanisms of cytokine storm induced by it will be introduced in detail including the ways in which cytokines are activated and released how they cause cell and organ damage and therapeutic interventions to prevent or quell this harmful processsars-cov-2 is a zoonotic human coronavirus cov closely related to those coronaviruses that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov discovered 9 coronaviruses are a group of positive-sense single-strand rna viruses with the largest genetic material and a likely ancient origin because the envelop spinous process similar to the corona known as coronavirus 10 sars-cov-2 belongs to the -coronavirus genus all coronaviruses have non-segmented genomes two thirds genomes consist of two large overlapping open reading frames orf1a and orf1b which are translated into 16 non-structural proteins nsp1 to nsp16 the remaining genome encodes structural proteins including nucleoprotein n receptor binding site spike glycoprotein s small envelope glycoprotein e and membrane glycoproteins m11 coronavirus entering targeted cells is mediated by spike protein the s protein includes two domains the s1 subunit is responsible for binding to the receptor and the s2 subunit combinate the virus and the host cell membrane 12 among the coronaviruses that have been identified n protein is the only protein present in the nucleocapsid and participates in viral replication binds to rna which is composed of two separate domains the n-terminal domain s1-ntd and the c-terminal domain s1-ctd both serve as rna receptor binding domains rbd13 coronaviruses have been recognized as the causes of mild and severe respiratory tracts diseases in humans and some animals compared with the other four low-pathogenic human viruses hcov-nl63 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 and hku1 are prone to cause mild cold-like symptoms the two highly pathogenic coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov cause severe respiratory infected in humans and even progress to fatal multiple organ failure14 in the light of published genomic data the sequence homology between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov was 79615 most of proteins are also highly homologous16 besides there are still unknown about the origin of sars-cov-2 although those cases were originally thought associated with huanan seafood market wuhan8 so these basic but important researches are exigent for rapidly finding the source for sars-cov-2 in order to prevent the ongoing outbreakit has been reported that the early clinical manifestations of patients with covid-19 are mainly fever 98 the second most common symptom was cough 82 shortness of breath which rapidly progress to pneumonia 8 nausea or vomiting and diarrhea were uncommon 17 abnormalities were found in chest computed tomography ct images of the patients mainly grinding glass-like opacity areas in bilateral lungs of the infected 72 18 common underlying diseases in patients may be risk factors for poor prognosis including diabetes hypertension chronic heart disease and kidney disease especially for older men 19 with a median time from the first symptoms to dyspnea of 50 days developing to ards time is 80 days 20 a study showed that 17 of patients progress to ards 11 of whom condition worsened within a short period time and died of multiple organ failure 21 patients with covid-19 have very similar clinical characteristics to those infected with sars-cov or mers-cov 6 22 23 positive sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test can diagnose covid-19 assisted with ct and antibody tests the most common abnormalities in laboratory results include normal or reduced white blood cells lymphocyte decreased 83217 and abnormally elevated alt and ast24 25 proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 and tnf- increased d-dimer c-reactive protein crp and procalcitonin pct also increased8 in addition patients plasma angiotensin ii ang ii levels were significantly increased which was related to viral load and lung injury 24clinical manifestations and pathology studies have shown that patients with covid-19 mainly performed lung injury 26 and most of the deaths due to multiple organ failure caused by ards 5 27 in addition icu patients showed higher levels of plasma cytokines like il-628 d-dimer crp and pct29 suggesting that inflammatory responses played a key role in these injuries and may also be related to the severity of the patients30 even the cause of death owing to the lack of direct evidence it is unclear how the process of inflammatory response involved cytokines is fully completed but it is certain that the manifested clinical features are directly related to the violent occurrence of inflammationcytokine storm refers to the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines that having a wide range of biological activity from a variety of tissues cells mainly for immune cells which due to different infection and a loss of negative feedback on the immune in turn those cytokines drive a positive feedback on others immune cells and continue to recruit them to the sites of inflammation begetting the growing inflammation exponentially and organ damage in short it is the unceasing extreme activation and attack of the autoimmune system the main cytokines involved are interleukin il interferon ifn tumor necrosis factor tnf colony stimulating factor csf chemokine family growth factor gf etc they are divided into pro-inflammatory factors such as il1 il6 il12 tnf ifn and anti-inflammatory factors such as il4 il10 il13 tgf based on their functions cytokine storms are a crucial cause of ards systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ failure 31 moreover the viruses invade lung epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages to produce progeny nucleic acid which stimulate infected cells to release cytokines and chemokines activating macrophages and dendritic cells etc 13 much more chemokines and cytokines are released from these cells to attract more inflammatory cells to migrate to the site of inflammation from the blood vessels thereby cascading amplification the inflammatory responseit has long been believed that well-coordinated and rapid innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infection the cytokines synthesized and secreted by immune cells are involved in the induction period and effect phases in all inflammatory reactions more importantly activating the initiation of cytokine transcription mechanism to promote secretion is the key link when immune cells in the body detect the pathogen-associated molecular pattern pamp from the virus through the pattern recognition receptor prr on the cell membrane immediately the innate immune response system is activated 32 among the prrs the most typical is toll-like receptor tlr3 tlr3 is a transmembrane receptor extracellular accessory proteins md-1 md-2 and rp105 are involved in the recognition of pamp 33 macrophages are the key cells for host defense tlr3 on macrophages specifically recognizes the intermediate product ds-rna of virus replication followed by the recruitment recruits signal transfer proteins myd88 tirap tram or trif in the cytoplasmic tir domain activation of various kinases iraks tbk1 and ikks and tumor necrosis factor receptor-related factor 6 traf6 according to the different adaptors eventually nf-b mapk or jnk-stat pathways were activated to promote the transcription of inflammatory cytokines and produce ifn il-1 and il-6 etc coordinating local or systemic inflammatory responses34figure 1
 il-1 and il-6 are the major pro-inflammatory cytokines released during viral infections 35 il-1 enhances inflammatory responses of bronchia and alveolar in patients with lung injury at the same time acute phase proteins from hepatocytes stimulated by il-1 and il-6 activate the complement system and the complement cascade further increases vascular permeabilityprr activates multiple cytokine transcription and delayed ifn- and - responseil-6 has always been an important star factor in cytokine storms in virus-infected lesions il-6 can respond to il-1 tnf- or tlr signals trigger cis-regulatory modules and activate the nf-b transcriptional signaling pathway and the binding site of the nuclear factor il-6 caatebp 36 but the most important is that il-6 combines with transmembrane receptor il-6r to generate the il-6il-6r complex then the signal transduction component gp130 dimerization induced by the complex and activated janus kinase signal transduction and transcription activators 37 figure 1 high levels of il-6 can activate the coagulation system and increase vascular permeability providing conditions for the rapid spread of inflammation 37 as reported that higher levels of il-6 in severe patients with covid-19 which proves that high levels of il-6 may cause greater damage to lung tissue 8 it has been verified in vitro that sars-cov s protein induces upregulation of il-6 and tnf- in mouse macrophages through the nf-b pathway 38 the cytokine-mediated inflammatory response pathway is a series of intersecting networks each one has a degree of redundancy and with alternate pathways the combinations of tlr and ligands initiate signal cascaded amplification and lead to the activation of multiple cytokine pathways which is the main research focus of current inflammatory responsesthrough the regulation of cytokines and chemokines conventional lymphocytes t cells and b cells differentiate into specific effector cells and localize at the site of infected for instance cd4t cells differentiate into th1 cells and produce ifn- to activate macrophages and other types of cells because of the induction of il12 thereby triggering defense against intracellular pathogens at the same time ifn- can induce the transcription of multiple chemokines besides il-6 induce the differentiation of cd8t cells into cytotoxic t cells which eliminated the viruses in the way of lysing infected cells suicide the consumption of cytotoxic t cells may be the cause of the decrease in lymphocytes in most patients with covid-198 it has been found t lymphocytes are a vital source of many chemokines and express multiple molecule receptors 39 such as neutrophils and macrophages are drawn to the region of injury by il-8 and mcp-1chemotactic influences respectively while secreting chemokines to recruit more cells to participate in the battle with pathogens it is now accepted that each cell can respond to multiple chemokines just by expressing a single type of receptor it is this complex relationship between chemokines and their receptors that makes chemokines rapidly replenish in various microenvironments and the inflammatory storm continues to develop 35 according a report the proinflammatory cytokines like tnf il-6 and chemokines il8 ccl3 mcp-1 ccl5 ccl2 and cxcl10 were significantly up-regulated while the anti-inflammatory factor such as il10 was lacking in sars patients31 which showed that the lack of anti-inflammatory factors can cause an imbalance in the inflammatory response and promote cytokine stormacute lung injury ali is a common consequence of cytokine storm in lung tissue and systemic circulation 40 recently pulmonary pathology of sars-cov-2 infection showed the major changes of the lung tissue showed diffuse alveolar damage alveolar edema and proteinaceous exudates thickening of alveolar walls evident desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation indicated ards 26 and multinucleated giant cells in the alveolar cavity inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes in the pulmonary mesenchyme 27 in addition the patients pathological results confirmed that the number of cd4t and cd8t cells in peripheral blood reduced but over-activated the high proinflammatory effects th17 cells increased that concentrating ccr4ccr6 and cd8t cells contain high concentrations of cytotoxic granules mainly perforin and granulysin which can cause severe immune damage in patients 27 these evidences showed that patients with extensive acute lung injury and multiple organ failure which may be caused by the activation of the bodys immune system including innate immunity and adaptive immunity resulting in a strong inflammatory stormfrom the molecular modeling structural analysis results of 2019-ncov receptors the receptor binding domain rbd of sars-cov-2 has more effective interaction with ace2 compared to sars-cov47 the binding of s protein to ace2 is the first step for the virus to enter target cells accomplished by proteolytic cleavage and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes 13 it was speculated that sars-cov-2 might also cause lung tissue injury in the same pathogenic mechanism 48 on the one hand when sars-cov-2 infects alveolar cells s1 and ace2 transmembrane domains combine to reduce the level of ace2 resulting in the renin angiotensin system ras tilts towards the ace-ang ii axis 49 meanwhile the production of ang ii is absolutely or relatively elevated which causing macrophagocyte infiltration inducing cytokines and adhesion molecules increase including il-6 monocyte chemotactic protein 1 mcp-1 vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 vcam-1 selectin e etc causing endothelial dysfunction 50 51 besides down-regulation of ace2 reduces protective effects against acute lung injury 49 leading to increased pulmonary capillary permeability and pulmonary edema and severe patients may die of respiratory failure on the other hand cell experiment studies in vitro have shown that sars-cov s induces shedding of the ace2 extracellular ectodomain and promotes virus entry into cells through dependence on tnf- converting enzyme tace but the function of free sace2 is unknown currently which may also mediate inflammation and tissue injury 52 in addition the binding of virus and ace2 might also be involved in intracellular pathway recognitionpyroptosis is a new inflammatory form of programmed cell death inflammation storms caused by sars-cov-2 infection may be related to cell pyroptosis research evidences from chen et al showed that sars-cov viroporin 3a protein activates nlrp3 nod-like receptors protein 3 inflammasome causing il-1 production 53 reduced cell counts and increased il-1 in serum of covid-19 patients may indicated activation of cell pyroptosis when a variety of extracellular pamps are recognized by tlrs 54 which triggers activation of the nf-b signaling pathway and upregulation of inflammasome related components including inactivated nlrp3 proil-1 and proil-18 subsequently nlrp3 oligomerize and it was connected with the pro-caspase-1 through the adaptor protein asc to form a multiprotein complex thereby activating caspase-155 activated caspase-1 recruits and incises members of the polymerizes gasdermin family such as gsdmd in the pathway downstream56 simultaneously incises the precursors of il-1 and il-18 forming active il-1 and il18 which are released into the extracellular to recruit more inflammation cells to aggregate and expand the inflammatory response57 besides the active cleavage fragment of gsdmd caused extensive cell perforation by inserting into the lipid bilayer resulting in cell swelling and lysis which was followed by release of contents such as cellular matrix and cytokines 58 a mass of endogenous molecules from immune intracellular are released such as oxidized phospholipids and cellular matrix which are called damage-associated molecular patterns damp similar to pamp known as alarm singles they can also be recognized by nlrp3 thereby progressively magnify the inflammatory effects and cause cell pyroptosis59 figure 2
 covid-19 patients often have lymphopenia but further research is still needed to prove whether it is also related to this mechanismintracellular signaling mechanism of cell pyroptosis induced by pampsifn is a core family in innate antiviral immunity type i interferons ifn- and - are essential especially for the innate immune response against viruses and other microbial infections the binding of type i interferon and tis dimer receptor ifnar activates the jak-stat signal transduction pathway in which jak1 and tyk2 kinases phosphorylate stat1 stat2 and irf9 form a complex these complexes enter the nucleus and initiate the transcription of ifn-stimulated genes isg 60 in vitro studies have found that rapid replication of sars-cov in mice induces significant but delayed ifn- response accompanied by a large influx of pathogenic inflammatory mononuclear macrophages imm 61 leading to lung cytokines and chemokine increased vascular leakage and virus-specific t cell apoptosis further hinder virus clearance in addition studies have demonstrated that coronaviruses can rapidly replicate in host cells and encode proteins nsp1 that antagonizes ifns response by blocking stat1 phosphorylation 13 62 meanwhile structural proteins m and n inhibit ifns signaling by deactivating traf3 tbk1ikks and some other mechanisms respectively 63 the coronavirus structural and non-structural protein against the delayed response of ifns further amplifies the inflammatory response by promoting viral replication followed with the increase of viral pamps in turn the pamps inhibit delayed ifn signaling and stimulate prr-induced abnormal inflammatory responses 64 above all it should be clear that these putative antiviral mechanisms have been confirmed in step-by-step studies whether they are really important in infectious viruses and systemic antagonist pathways need to be further studiedgenerally considered that antiviral antibodies play a much important role in the viral clearance according to reports the response to anti-s-neutralizing antibodies nab in dead patients developed significantly faster 147 vs 20 days and higher level than patients who had recovered during sars 65 in a sars-cov macaque experimental model inoculated with s protein antibody it has been found that anti-s-igg facilitate severe lung injury in the early stages of infection via eliminates wound healing macrophage response and tgf- production as well as promote inflammatory macrophages and the production of factors mcp-1 and il-866 these evidences suggested that anti-s-igg may also play an important role in lung injury caused by acute sars-cov-2 infection during acute infection period 66 since fcr was blockaded reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines it is considered that the virus-anti-s-igg complex may promote cytokine release by binding to fc receptors on the surface of macrophages or additionally through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity adcc directly lyses target cells 67 whether this complex is associated with antibody-dependent enhancement ade 68 or complement system activation in patients with covid-19 during viral replication 55 remains to be proven by further studiesin sum the rapid spread of sars-cov-2 has forced all medical institutions to carry out research and prevention and control worldwide all efforts are being made to slow the spread of covid-19 in order to provide better public-health recommendations and to develop timely diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines the mentioned above potential mechanisms are based on two outbreaks of coronavirus and current partial research 69 many new mechanisms still unknown new treatments are developed based on existing experience in combating viral infections however at present treatment strategies for sars-cov-2 infection are only supportive more important is no effective antiviral therapies for covid-19 here we assume and discuss that sars-cov-2 likely associate similar cytokines storm therapeutic interventions targeting these pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines may help alleviate adverse inflammatory responsescorticosteroids are usually used to suppress inflammation responses which were the main means of immunomodulatory therapy during the sars epidemic but the early patients were found increased plasma viral load and secondary infections 70 in some studies early administration of ifn is beneficial in reducing viral load and moderately improves clinical performance and combination with ribavirin also made certain therapeutic effect 71 ifn- inhibited the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the production of il-1 without excessive stimulation for the immune system which might become a potential therapeutic direction 72 besides the results from the management of patients with covid-19 by xu et al showed that an artificial liver blood purification system can quickly clear inflammation mediators to suppress cytokine storms however repair system may be delayed for excessive clarity 73 however these strategies still need to be tested for clinical effectiveness in addition there is evidence that the serine protease tmprss2 plays an important role in sars-cov-2 entry into cellular but tmprss2 inhibitors can prevent entry this may become a treatment option and more sars-cov-2 was neutralized by serum from recovery sars patients 41 showing a good therapeutic effect therefore the use of intravenous immunoglobulin may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation meanwhile which means that vaccine development may be the most effective means but current vaccine production faces many obstacles this requires researchers to explore via international cooperationstudies have found that there may be individual differences in susceptibility to cytokine storms the innate immune response of healthy people is highly variable which can be genetically confirmed the tlr receptor for example sepsis patients with single nucleotide polymorphisms snps of tlr1 hypermorphic variants which is associated with increased susceptibility to organ dysfunction death and gram-positive bacteremia infection 74 tlr4 is the major contributor to lipopolysaccharide lps and its variants can make individuals susceptible to sepsis genome-wide association studies gwas have linked tlr4 polymorphisms to pathogen susceptibility and disease severity 35 future researches likely reveal potential genetic variations that affect host cytokine storms during infection in addition the bodys immune pathological damage is closely related to the viral load and the degree of the cytokine storm is an essential connection point if plasma cytokines are monitored dynamically to assess the degree of cytokine storm timely and effectively which may be of great benefit to the care of critically ill patientsthe inflammatory response is an essential part of the immune system to function otherwise pathogen will be difficult to eliminate sars-cov-2 might induce excessive and prolonged cytokine responses resulting in lung damage and multiple organ failure so far most studies have focused on the direct measurement of those cytokines and chemokines in peripheral blood but in the context of the rapidly changing cytokine environment after virus infection we have no round understanding the cause of the vigorous inflammatory response a comprehensive understanding of the factors although existing researches have shown that during the occurrence of pathogenic hcov infection the violent cytokine storm caused immune pathological damage and may be the real dead killer in critically ill patients at the same time human autopsy and animal models studies provided some evidences for the pathogenic mechanism of inflammatory cytokines derived from imm and neutrophils however current researches are limited and detailed molecular biology principles and broader epidemiology are lacking therefore future researches should not only focus on the identification of specific inflammatory response signaling pathways in patients and animals infected with hcov but of course include the scientific and effective application to control the spread of the virus worldwidethe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

dreaded course due to cytokine storm in lung tissue leading to fatality4 intervention to inhibit such cytokine storm from being generated can prevent cases from fatal outcome worldwide deaths due to covid-19 are increasing day by day measures to curb these deaths are underway with no obvious benefits patients at risk are the elderly and those with comorbid illness such as diabetes hypertension chronic airway diseases and cancersinhibition of the cytokine storm may prevent the emergence of fatal lung injury as observed in many case reports the cytokine milieu was higher in patients landing in icu as compared to non-intensive care unit patients the recruitment of cytokine in the cytokine storm that results in fatal disease is similar to the activation of airway epithelial cells immune response airway epithelial response to viral infection is release of various cytokines such as interleukin-6 il-6 tumor necrosis factor- tnf- granulocyte colony-stimulating factor csf and granulocyte-macrophage-csf gm-csf5 high il-6 levels are associated with disease severity but ablation of il-6 signaling by il-6 receptor antibodies can lead to uncontrolled virus replication resulting in greater mortality6 tnf- on the other hand leads to impair viral replication enhances cytotoxic activity and cytokine production by leukocytes and activates endothelial cells7 elevated levels of tnf- have been associated with greater morbidity during infection with highly pathogenic virus and blocking activity of tnf- attenuates immune- mediated pathologygm-csf is elevated in covid-198 gm-csf leads to the activation of dcs and macrophages which in other case should have recruited macrophages to clear viral-infected cells by phagocytosis but that seems to be have been overwhelmed by immune-mediated injury to lung and mortality due to cytokine storm5one thing is crystal clear that fatal course of covid-19 is the result of mature immune response and resultant cytokine storm leading to fatal lung injury hence children have mildmoderate disease but it is the elderly who are at riskworldwide focus is on targeting il-6 tocilizumab-il-6 receptor humanized antibody has shown promising result in dealing with covid-19 patients it was previously used to treat rheumatoid arthritisother studies are focusing on targeting gm-csf however all these measures also put at the risk of increased viral replication6 such measures can potentially cause more morbid outcome or prolonged course of disease it may also lead to increased community transmissionnicotinamide leads to the inhibition of poly adp ribose polymerase parp activity this in turn inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase expression reduced free radicals and pro-inflammatory cytokines with restoration of adenosine triphosphate9 nicotinamide is also used to mitigate acute lung injury due to bleomycin10 nicotinamide and its structurally similar isoniazid pyrazinamide are used to treat tuberculosis nicotinamide is used in treating hiv11 in cases of covid-19 infection and resultant cytokine storm leading to acute lung injury if we focus on restoration of atp by nicotinamide supplementation this approach may mitigate inflammatory response and ultimately outcomeelderly population is otherwise deficient in niacin putting them at increased risk of tissue injury due to covid-19 and poor recovery of tissue damage niacin supplementation will help them in restoring tissue damage12 it may result in better outcome aging leads to slower metabolism and reduced absorption of dietary niacintargeting cytokine storm is what everyone targeting and it seems apt but if we think of tissue restoration and prevention of damage due to cytokine storm then supplementation of key factors needed for mitigating tissue injury should be taken into consideration niacin supplementation has shown reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines although in animal model13in vitro studies done on endotoxemia due to lipopolysaccharide ie outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria known for inducing cytokine storm due to cytokine activation through aberrant pathway leading to sepsis were reduced by nicotinamide supplementation in a dose-dependent manner14a systematic review of such supplementation suggested that vitamin b deficiency may weaken host immune response they should be supplemented to the virus-infected patients to enhance their immune system therefore b vitamins could be chosen as a basic option for the treatment of covid-1915this systematic review also suggested role of vitamin b3 nicotinamide as of potential use vitamin b3 treatment significantly inhibited neutrophil infiltration into lungs and produced strong anti-inflammatory effect during ventilator- induced lung injury vili15 in one study done on mice nicotinamide was associated with hypoxemia in vili but even they mentioned that neutrophil-induced lung injury was reduced due to niacin supplementation16parp plays an important role in the immune response of lung17 parp-1 inhibitor decreased the levels of il-6 and active plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in the lungs attenuated leukocyte lung transmigration and reduced pulmonary edema and apoptosis18 parp is known to have pathogenesis in mechanical vili19considering the molecular mechanism of covid-19 targeting parp is a sensible approach out of which nicotinamide can be economical way to deal with parp inhibition parp inhibitors can be repurposed in acute lung injury20 parp inhibitors in clinical development mimic the nicotinamide moiety of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hence nicotinamide which is the first parp inhibitor has activity against parp-1 parp-2 can be used as parp inhibitor21the bodys niacin requirement is met not only by nicotinic acid and nicotinamide present in the diet but also by conversion from the dietary protein-containing tryptophan the relative contribution of tryptophan is estimated as follows 60 mg of tryptophan  1 mg of niacin  1 mg of niacin equivalents22 nicotinamide recommended daily allowance is 03 mgkgday as recommended daily allowance however the dose needed for parp inhibition is between 300 and 500 mgkg it is a very high dose of nicotinamide adverse effects of nicotinamide are rare and have occurred mainly with high oral doses 6gday which include nausea vomiting liver toxicity headache fatigue and dizziness23we must also know that dealing with immunity one must be sure of timing of the administration of antioxidant to modulate immunity as suppression following figure may explain it in better wayreactive oxygen species ros levels decide immune responses the levels of ros lead to the physiological responses of inflammatory cells high levels of intracellular ros levels result in exaggerated inflammatory responses associated with cytokine storm and relatively low ros levels give hypoinflammatory response leading to immunosuppression ros levels in the intermediate range result in normal immune cell functionthe use of antioxidants may only be beneficial during periods of exaggerated inflammatory responses but may be detrimental during periods of relative immunosuppression thus the efficacy of antioxidants is dependent on an individuals inflammatory response profile with timing and duration of antioxidant administration critical to demonstrating a salutary effect as a therapeutic intervention individualizing dosing will likely be a crucial element in optimizing the potential of an antioxidant strategy24initially described in the early 1990s following the administration of the anti-t-cell antibody muromonab-cd3 the cytokine storm has been linked to different other conditions and therapeutic agents overtime thereby broadening the spectrum of this disease8 nowadays the term cytokine storm applies to several fields of medicine being a potentially serious complication of immunotherapy and several infectious neoplastic and autoimmune diseaseshaemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh is a t-cell-driven hyperinflammatory hyperferritinemic condition characterised by persistent ifn-dependent stimulation of toll-like receptors tlrs antigen-presenting cells and t-cell uncontrolled activation ultimately leading to a cytokine storm9 according to the 2019 histiocyte society recommendations hlh therapeutic strategies are based on the concept that it is a heterogeneous disease of variable aetiology and severity hence treatment should be tailored to control hyperinflammation with glucocorticoids intravenous immunoglobulin cyclosporine and etoposide being the historical anchor drugs and to treat identified disease triggers other immunomodulating agents like il-1 or il-6 inhibitors are only recommended in selected cases including the macrophage activation syndrome mas a subtype of shlh associated with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis sjia adult-onset stills disease aosd and other autoimmune disorders10a context of infection by a new viral agent adds another layer of complexity to the management of the cytokine storm thus challenging the translation of the evidence from autoimmune diseases the causal relation between sars-cov2 and shlh relies in its ability to bind tlrs and induce the above-mentioned cascade via activation of the inflammasome and release of il-111 importantly lung tissue samples collected from patients with sars-cov during the sars epidemic in the early 2000s have been reported to exhibit hemophagocytosis features12 however not all patients with covid-19 develop a fully blown shlh and those with worse prognosis may neither fulfil hlh-2004 diagnostic criteria table 113 nor reach the hlh-probability calculator hscore cut-off values the authors who developed the hscore pointed out that as each underlying disease is associated with peculiar biologic abnormalities the cut-off values for laboratory criteria may need to be set accordingly14 ruan et al described significantly higher ferritin levels in severe covid-19 putting forward the hypothesis that it can represent a prognostic marker in this disease however the mean ferritin values in patients with better prognosis were still over the hlh-2004 cut-off 500 gl and it is unclear how many of the deceased patients reached the hscore ferritin cut-off 2000 ngml and at which stage of the disease15 recently it has been proposed that aosd mas catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome and septic shock characterised by similar clinical picture and very elevated serum ferritin levels are included in the so-called hyperferritinaemic syndrome16 interestingly an association between pulmonary involvement and hlh was reported in patients with sjia mediated by gene pathways related to the ifn response17 and lung imaging pattern and inflammatory mediators appear to be similar to those of patients with covid-19 on this basis covid-19 with pulmonary involvement could be considered itself a hyperferritinaemic syndrome regardless of concomitant shlh12 the identification of hemophagocytosis features in covid-19 lung tissue the assessment of ferritin and proinflammatory cytokines trends overtime along with receiver operating characteristic curves computed with data of patients with covid-19 would add significant knowledge on this matter in particular this would allow 1 to confirm whether covid-19 is yet another hyperferritinemic syndrome 2 to clarify whether current hscore cut-off values are reliable in these patients or should be redefined and 3 to understand the actual extent of the cytokine storm in all patients with covid-19 regardless of the severity and ultimately to support clinicians in the decision of when and in whom to start immunomodulating therapy and with which compound moreover it is important to understand whether in severe forms of covid-19-associated pneumonia ferritin is a mere acute phase protein or rather an active pathogenic mediator in addition in light of the pro-inflammatory role of ferritin enriched in heavy subunits heavy ferritin it could be of interest to evaluate the heavylight ferritin ratio in covid-1918 finally the potential usefulness of the ferritinerythrocyte sedimentation rate ratio which may be an immediate inexpensive and easy-to-implement biomarker needs to be considered19despite earlier reports outlined that covid-19 morbidity and mortality in children was very low20 very recently several children with a novel multisystem inflammatory disease resembling toxic shock syndrome tss and atypical kawasaki disease kd with proven sars-cov2 infection have been observed in the uk likewise an increased frequency of kd has been reported in italy21 22 tss is a rare life-threatening condition due in most cases to toxins produced by staphylococcus aureus bacteria but also related to group a streptococcus tss is characterised by fever diffuse macular erythroderma desquamation 12 weeks after onset of rash hypotension and multisystem involvement of three or more of the following organ systems gastrointestinal muscular mucous membrane renal hepatic hematologic central nervous system23 however to be classified as probable or definite tss the clinical picture is necessary but not sufficient and either of the two above-mentioned bacteria need to be isolated from biologic samples in the current circumstances whether viral isolates may be also considered remains to be elucidated as it is tempting to speculate that the sars-cov2 alone or in combination could be triggering or facilitating the tss on the other hand kd is an acute systemic vasculitis characterised by fever non-suppurative conjunctival injection rash oral mucositis extremity changes and cervical lymphadenopathy and along with scarlet fever meningococcaemia and other conditions represent a differential diagnosis of tss it comes with no surprise that elevated il-1b and il-6 levels in addition to a monotype profile shifted to intermediate monocytes are common hallmarks in kd24 mas is a complication in about 2 of patients with kd however the incidence is likely underestimated as many clinical and laboratory features of both diseases overlap and the hlh 2009 criteria have low sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of mas complicating kd25 recently classification criteria for mas in the paediatric population have been released and will allow to provide more reliable epidemiological data26 on this basis it is conceivable that what is defined as a novel multisystem inflammatory disease may be yet another condition caused by the covid-19-induced cytokine storm the existing evidence although limited that unlike adults children with covid-19 and a good prognosis display normal ferritin levels underscores the importance to measure this molecule in those with severe covid-19 and the above-mentioned multisystem inflammatory disease2729 furthermore comparing the vascular involvement in the young and lung involvement in the adultelderly will help not only to characterise the pathogenic mechanisms behind sars-cov2 infection but also to gain understanding towards differential responses across the lifespan the latter may be useful to define personalised medicine algorithms or better adjust the existing onesmost of the aspects of the hyperinflammation during covid-19 remain therefore to be elucidated and it is not known who will develop the cytokine storm when and at which extent nonetheless several immunomodulating agents inhibiting the activity of ifn il-1 tnf il-6 and the janus kinase 1 and 2signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway are under investigation for the treatment of selected cases of covid-19 despite being the mainstay of treatment of hyperinflammation immunomodulatory agents are double-edged swords in a viral infection they must be managed with caution and special attention needs to be considered when referring to non-viral hyperinflammation treatment guidelines in this regard the location the timing and the viral phase deserve some considerations that should guide treatment with these compoundsfirst it must be noted that disease timing is associated with distinct organs involved although originated in the lungs the viral response phase leads to a host inflammatory response phase that is responsible for the hyperinflammation and thus cytokine storm30 the exact overlap between infection phase and organ involvement needs to be more precisely defined but it is tempting to speculate that underlying immune and inflammatory mechanisms differ across these phases which will have clear implications for the therapy it is conceivable that local immune activation in the lungs precedes the general hyperinflammation observed at the systemic level the multi-organ failure observed in the late stages of covid-19 severe infection is aligned with this notion alternatively it may be hypothesised that an uncontrolled replication in the lungs due to a poor innate or cd8-mediated viral clearance may facilitate viral spreading via the vasculature to the systemic compartment the fact that sars-cov2 binds the ace2 which is expressed both in lungs and the vascular endothelium may support this idea an in-depth characterisation of the draining lymph node microenvironment should be pursued to better delineate infection kinetics and hence disease stagessecond during the acute inflammatory response to infective agents we observe a rapid within 30 min increase of tnf and il-1 levels and a subsequent rise of il-6 the high levels of il-6 last for longer while tnf and il-1 levels rapidly decrease within 2448 hours31 therefore clinical trials need to clarify the outcome of treating patients with immunosuppressants at different disease stages and with different extent of pulmonary involvement in this regard interim results of the french corimuno-toci open-label randomised controlled trial have been recently announced32 a total of 129 patients being hospitalised for covid-19 moderate or severe pneumonia not requiring intensive care upon admission were enrolled in the study and randomised 11 to receive standard of care with or without tocilizumab a significantly lower proportion of patients needed ventilation non-invasive or mechanical or died by day 14 in the tocilizumab group confirming that early intervention may be a major determinant to ensure adequate tackling of the cytokine stormfurthermore treatment with glucocorticoids may be beneficial for patients who develop ards especially in the light of cost availability knowledge of the drug and previous use in hyperinflammation however they have been linked to exacerbation of covid-19-associated lung injury33 trials are needed to investigate the optimal dosage and timing of glucocorticoids for covid-19 treatmentfinally as only some of the patients with covid-19 are yet being treated with antiviral agents clinicians should pay attention to viral load and find a balance between ablating the cytokine storm via the use of immunomodulating agents without significantly affecting the host defence against the virus thereby preventing uncontrolled replication in this regard the ideal scenario would be to combine treatments for the cytokine storm with effective antiviral therapy thus reinforcing the need for disease stratification in benefit of the treatment decision-making processin conclusion although the cytokine storm we observe in covid-19 is similar to that observed in other diseases this scenario is more complex than initially thought due to the heterogeneity of hyperinflammation in addition the question remains on whether is it a general phenomenon or rather a reaction of the lung possibly in relation to a massive viral invasion secondary to a lack of antiviral response only a deeper understanding of the origin and the different phases of the cytokine storm in relation to the whole clinical picture and disease evolution will allow to draw a definitive conclusion on the nature and natural history of this process a better characterisation of the host immune response across disease stages systemiclung phase transition and viral lung tropism is needed the acquisition of such notions will allow to confirm whether covid-19 can be considered a hyperferritinaemic syndrome by itself and to optimise the management of this condition based on disease stage stratification viral load and cytokine signature to ultimately tailor the therapeutic approach and improve disease prognosisthe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is now overwhelming spreading throughout the world and has been declared a global pandemic by the who so far more than 4 million confirmed cases have been reported by who worldwide including more than 290000 deaths and the treatment for the critically ill patients of covid-19 remains a challengethe first report of pathological characteristics of the patient who died from severe infection with sars-cov-2 demonstrated an increased concentration of highly proinammatory cytokines1 actually the cytokine storm mediated by overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines has been observed in a large population of critically ill patients with covid-192 cytokine storms can result in cardiovascular collapse multiple organ dysfunction cardiac arrest and death epinephrine a vasoactive agent has been routinely employed to the critical situation such as cardiac arrest however it remains uncertain whether epinephrine can also benefit the cardiac arrest following cytokine storms occurred in covid-19 patients this is a question that is easy overlooked but deserves deep considerationin a study published in nature3 staedtke et al used subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps to continuously release epinephrine norepinephrine or dopamine into mice treated with lipopolysaccharide lps mice with epinephrine not norepinephrine or dopamine showed an exacerbated disease course with higher levels of interleukin 6 tumour necrosis factor and chemoattractants compared with lps-treated controls this result revealed that epinephrine may fuel the cytokine storms and the effect of epinephrine in initiating cytokine storms was further confirmed in a different model system of severe bacterial infection actually it was known that immune cells such as macrophages activated by inflammatory stimuli induce catecholamines and respond to them in an autocrine manner which amplifies the inflammatory response4 even the idea that epinephrine acts to promote cytokine storms seems to be counter-intuitive since the molecules of this class are used routinely to treat the low blood pressure associated with cytokine storms these integrated evidences suggest that epinephrine can stimulate further cytokine and catecholamine release and this autocrine amplification cascade might worsen cytokine storms in those covid-19 patients therefore the clinic reassessment of the benefit of epinephrine for rescuing cardiac arrest caused by cytokine storms in those covid-19 patients is urgently neededwe retrospectively analysed 206 patients who diagnosed as covid-19 and suffered a rescue treatment with epinephrine at tongji hospital in wuhan china from january 27 to march 1 2020 it was noticed that only 4206 2 of patients were survivors and discharged from hospital eventually the severity of the disease may account mostly for the poor outcome however as expected from the established role of epinephrine in fueling the cytokine storms the aggravated cytokine storms may have also played a role in the failure of the rescuebeyond rapid defibrillation and early initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation there are few therapies that have been identified to improve survival for cardiac arrest patients reliably the use of epinephrine during resuscitation is a mainstay of agent in cardiac arrest however the safety and effectiveness of this agent remains controversial5 6 vasopressin has been proposed as an alternative to epinephrine in cardiac arrest based on the finding that its levels were markedly higher in successfully resuscitated patients than in patients who died7 compared with epinephrine vasopressin has several advantages first it increases arterial peripheral resistance without resulting direct myocardial stimulation moreover it is more resistant to acidosis and has a longer half-life most importantly it does not fuel the cytokine storms although for common cardiac arrest compared with epinephrine no advantage from the use of vasopressin has been identified in any of the outcomes from clinical studies but for cardiac arrest in those covid-19 patients vasopressin still should be fully assessed considering the cytokine storms occurred in this special population which might limit the use of epinephrineclinical decision making must balance the risks and benefits of treatment therefore it is time to reevaluate the effect of epinephrine use in covid-19 patients with cytokine storms and other agents such as vasopressin should be compared with epinephrine and fully assessed for their opportunities as an alternative strategyrecent reports of elevated serum cytokine levels associated with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 have raised questions about the relationship between cytokine storms and the severe complications associated with this infection the goal of this primer is to provide an introduction into the current concepts largely through the lens of sepsis hotchkiss et al 2016 that help understand the underlying causes of cytokine storms and how they interact with coagulation and vascular health and to briefly discuss how this may help understand the pathophysiology of covid-19 historically the recognition of sepsis as a clinical condition was associated with the presence of bacterial infections in the blood this definition has expanded to include all infections or suspected infections that result in immune dysregulation characterized by systemic inflammation and remote organ injury we will discuss how elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines most notably interleukin il-1 il-2 il-6 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf interferon ifn and tumor necrosis factor tnf interact with the complement and coagulation systems to induce disseminated intravascular coagulation dic respiratory failure acute respiratory distress syndrome ards hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh histiocyte is another term for macrophage and multi-organ failure finally given the current covid-19 pandemic the potential contribution of different cytokines to viral sepsis is a topic of interest that may provide an opportunity for interventionsone conceptual framework for how the immune system functions is the idea that the innate ability to recognize an invading organism provides signals that condition cells of the immune system to respond appropriately this is associated with an amplification of the protective response that is proportionate to pathogen burden but is also influenced by regulatory mechanisms that limit immune hyperactivity as infection is controlled there is typically an inflection point associated with entry into a phase of resolution and repair that allows a return to homeostasis figure 1
a cytokines have a direct role in the activation of anti-microbial effector functions but also provide the regulatory signals that specify amplify and resolve the immune response a cardinal feature of these secreted proteins is that they have short half-lives which will typically restrict communication to those cell types within lymphoid tissues and at sites of inflammation at high-enough levels cytokines can also have systemic activities and the colony stimulating factors produced at sites of microbial invasion can promote emergency granulopoiesis in the bone marrow associated with increased production and mobilization of neutrophils and monocytes for those infections with systemic involvement the presence of increased levels of cytokines will impact a wide range of physiological processes consequently under some circumstances enhanced innate recognition elevated t cell responses or a failure to resolve can manifest as levels of cytokines in the circulation that exceed normal thresholds and that result in collateral damage there are many experimental and clinical conditions that illustrate this state figure 1 and the terms cytokine storm cytokine release syndrome crs or hypercytokinaemia have been used to describe a variety of conditions that have diverse etiologies and outcomesunder ideal circumstances the immune system will provide a proportionate and appropriate response that mediates resistance to invading microorganisms and allows the host to survive infection for many infections the coordinated production of sustained circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines is a natural consequence of an appropriate innate and adaptive response critical for pathogen controlmany of the cytokines associated with different forms of sepsis can cause fever induce cell death and impact vascular physiology and coagulation as a result they have the potential to cause significant and widespread collateral tissue damage thus the benefits of sustained levels of circulating cytokines that promote microbial control are balanced by the need to limit immune-mediated damage to the host from an experimental and clinical perspective perhaps the most easily recognized form of a cytokine storm is the presence of supra-normal levels of cytokines associated with tissue damage beyond what could be attributed to the pathogen figure 1a there are other forms of cytokines storms that vary in magnitude and kinetics and that do not necessarily have an underlying infectious cause described below see figures 1b and 1c nevertheless in any of these circumstances the ability to neutralize cytokines to mitigate tissue damage and allow disease resolution highlights that these high levels are not just markers of inflammation but also key contributors to diseaseone of the major themes in immunology over the last 30 years is the increased emphasis on the checks and balances that limit every facet of innate and adaptive cell-mediated and humoral immunity these include specialized regulatory cell types imbued with anti-inflammatory properties as well as multiple mechanisms that mitigate the deleterious effects of cytokines since the overproduction of cytokines represents a major challenge to host health the presence of these regulatory pathways suggests that they may result from evolutionary pressure to balance pathogen control and tolerance of collateral damage in order to survive infection for example the receptor-ligand systems for cytokines are characterized by the presence of soluble receptors receptor antagonists and decoy receptors expressed at high levels in the tissues and serum these antagonists can buffer surges in cytokine activity and limit immunopathology in addition il-10 exemplifies the ability of cytokines to antagonize inflammatory cell populations and prevent immune hyperactivity nevertheless these protective mechanisms have their limits and excessive or sustained production of cytokines can override these regulatory mechanismsthe successful response to an infection is invariably accompanied by some level of inflammation and this is apparent by the elevated production of cytokines andor clinical symptoms ideally the magnitude of the response is related to pathogen burden and is restricted to the organ systems that are involved microbial pathogenesis is a critical determinant of these events whereby variables such as the replicative potential of the microorganism cell and tissue tropism production of toxins and immune evasion strategies will influence the duration and magnitude of the immune response whether there is local versus systemic involvement and the potential for sequelae these principles are of obvious relevance to many primary microbial challenges but all of humanity is persistently infected with a range of potentially lethal pathogens which are generally restrained in the immune competent host but can cause sepsis in the immunocompromised host this reality illustrates the concept that hosts need to be able to tolerate the presence of infections that can be life threatening with the production of cytokines that can be damaging the idea that resilience in the face of infection is a balance between protective and pathological responses is not new and is discussed here ayres 2020before describing the diverse events that can drive the innate and adaptive responses that are the basis of a cytokine storm it is helpful to consider the clinical consequences of high levels of cytokines figure 2
 these can converge on profound changes to the target tissues and the physiology of the host where not a single organ is spared and host survival is threatened a hallmark of a cytokine storm is persistent fever and non-specific constitutional symptoms weight loss joint and muscle pain fatigue headache progressive widespread systemic inflammation leads to a loss of vascular tone that is manifested as a drop in blood pressure vasodilatory shock and progressive organ failure in this context respiratory failure is the most prominent but will also impact the heart central nervous system and kidneys some of the clinical manifestations have been associated to specific cytokines il-6 and tnf are linked with fever and with constitutional symptoms capillary leak syndrome which refers to an increase in capillary permeability to proteins and is manifested clinically by hypotension edema acute respiratory failure and kidney injury is thought to be driven by il-2 in patients treated with il-2 or a monoclonal antibody okt3 that targets the cd3 complex on t cells thereby inducing il-2 this can be a significant clinical problem abnormalities revealed by clinical laboratory assays are often driven by the underlying driver of crs in patients with concomitant hlh pancytopenia reduced red blood cells rbcs white blood cells wbcs and platelets elevated triglycerides and ferritin predominate with accompanying hepatosplenomegaly patients with concurrent tumor lysis exhibit elevated uric acid ldh lactate and acute kidney injury hemostatic imbalance manifest by dic and thrombocytopenia reduced platelet numbers can be observed in almost all clinical syndromes associated with crs the levels of these endogenous molecules are important prognostic indicators of secondary complications and organ damage elevated triglycerides may cause pancreatitis uric acid can induce kidney failure and spontaneous intracranial hemorrhages are observed with profound thrombocytopenia thus treating the underlying driver of crs is a cornerstone of management to avoid further organ injuryas discussed above some of the prominent clinical features of cytokine storms are characterized by dic capillary leak syndrome and loss of blood pressure which indicates the crosstalk between cytokines and hemostasis in the absence of systemic inflammation the vascular endothelium employs numerous mechanisms to maintain barrier function and prevent aberrant coagulation a common feature of many systemic infections however is endothelial cell death a consequence of cytolytic infection or immune-mediated pathways which gives rise to vascular damage and the development of capillary leak syndrome as endothelial cells would be exposed to circulating cytokines and other immune mediators there are multiple systems to maintain their quiescence under inflammatory duress an evolutionary conserved component of the hemostatic response to tissue damage and to systemic infections includes the development of coagulation to prevent blood loss as part of this process fibrin deposition and the recruitment of platelets can form clots to seal areas of trauma in many settings elevated systemic cytokine levels are associated with a transient drop in platelet numbers in the circulation likely reflecting their consumption although there is continuous basal production of neutrophils from the bone marrow systemic cytokines can initiate emergency granulopoesis and increased recruitment of these cells into circulation there inflammatory mediators will promote neutrophil release of nuclear dna to form neutrophil extracellular traps nets which can snare pathogens but also contribute to thrombi formation this process termed immuno-thrombosis engelmann and massberg 2013 can also amplify the production of cytokines and is exemplified by links of thrombin with inflammasome activation and production of il-1 while these events are essentially host protective systemic inflammation can lead to widespread thrombus formation associated with vascular occlusion tissue damage dic and death of the host if these events are sustained one consequence is the depletion of clotting factors which renders patients more susceptible to catastrophic bleeding into critical spaces like the brain or thorax thus thrombi formation has an important role in host protection but needs to be carefully controlled to prevent aberrant pathologyanother evolutionary conserved line of defense against invading pathogens that intersects with cytokine biology and coagulation is the complement system this arm of the innate response is composed of soluble proteins that can recognize and lyse pathogens but can also act to amplify cellular responses the complex crosstalk between cytokines and the complement system is illustrated by the ability of cytokines to enhance production of components of the complement cascade which in turn can enhance or inhibit cytokine production although complement-mediated opsonization and formation of lytic complexes are critical processes necessary for pathogen elimination each of these effector functions can be injurious to bystander host cells given the importance of the endothelium in barrier function vascular tone and hemostasis there are several safeguards such as surface-bound and soluble complement regulatory proteins to prevent excessive complement-mediated injury to the normally quiescent endothelium failure of these safeguards or excessive complement activation result in endothelial injury that manifest as dysregulated coagulation and hemostasis loss of barrier function and vascular tone the vascular endothelium of the lung and kidneys are recognized as particularly vulnerable sites to complement-mediated injury and the clinical implications of widespread endothelial dysfunction as discussed abovegiven the potential for cytokines to cause tissue damage there is a need to mitigate the effects of high levels of cytokines and promote the transition into the resolution phase of an immune response there are numerous natural receptor and cytokine antagonists such as the il-1 receptor antagonist il-1ra that are a feature of cytokine signaling systems that buffer systemic off-target effects and restrict immune activities to local sites of cytokine release other cytokines and regulatory pathways can act more directly to limit the magnitude of the immune response for example il-10 is produced by many cell types subsets of monocytes as well as natural killer nk t and b cells and inhibits the ability of macrophage and dendritic cell dc populations to produce tnf il-1 il-6 and il-12 and decreases the ability of these cells to present antigen and provide costimulation thus il-10 is a key negative regulator of the accessory functions required for t cell mediated responses and there are numerous examples where infection of mice that lack il-10 is characterized by elevated sustained circulating levels of il-12 tnf and ifn ie a bona fide cytokine storm couper et al 2008 paradoxically increased circulating levels of il-10 are characteristic of the cytokine storms in humans and the assumption is that these increased levels reflect the presence of a negative feedback loop to control the magnitude of the response and to help with the resolution and repair phase of the responsethe existence of immune-regulatory networks to limit aberrant cytokine responses is critical to survive many infectious challenges but these do have a cost many of these pathways block the development of sterile immunity to infection and promote pathogen persistence in addition many patients who survive sepsis have long-term sequela that include profound immunosuppression and susceptibility to secondary infections there is a poor understanding of how this is mediated and one explanation is that the anti-inflammatory regulatory networks do not returns to pre-crisis levels of function and instead operate at a heightened state alternatively the systemic action of cytokines can result in remarkable changes in the cellular composition and organization of lymphoid structures such as the bone marrow thymus and spleen whether this disruption or loss of immunological infrastructure contributes to the long-term dysregulation is not understoodthe reports of elevated serum cytokines ifn il-6 and gm-csf associated with the coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov combined with ards have led to relevant questions about whether the subset of patients that develop life-threatening complications are a result of a cytokine storm min et al 2016 zhang et al 2004 at the time of writing a consensus has not yet emerged as to whether the pneumonia and ards associated with covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 is a consequence of sustained virus replication whether there is aberrant recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils into the lungs or how the vascular compartment may be involved the kinetics of the response to sars-cov-2 fits with models of the induction of conventional antiviral immunity and with a crisis that correlates with the likely peak phase of t cell responses nevertheless it is unclear if immune hyperactivity or a failure to resolve an inflammatory response because of ongoing viral replication or immune dysregulation underlies severe disease nevertheless the reports of increased levels of thrombi formation and endothelial cell death in covid-19 patients would indicate damage to the vascular endothelium and the involvement of cytokines and immunothrombosis ackermann et al 2020 fox et al 2020multiple studies deposited on biorxiv and medrxiv report elevated cytokine levels in severely ill covid-19 patients and the successful use of cytokine antagonists reviewed in depth here manjili et al 2020 some have even been able to compare these samples with those from other forms of sepsis or ards the presence of elevated cytokine levels in any patient with clinically diagnosed covid-19 should not be a surprise but whether these cross the threshold from protective to pathological is unclear since preexisting conditions that affect vascular health such as diabetes hypertension and cardiovascular disease appear to be the single largest factor that underlies covid-19 pathogenesis it is possible that these comorbidities may decrease resilience and lower the ability to tolerate systemic cytokines as this literature evolves it is important that cytokine measurements are standardized to allow comparisons between cohorts to determine whether there is prognostic value to identify patients who develop a bona fide cytokine storm the application of systems biology approaches that have already been developed to understand other forms of sepsis will help to guide the design of trials to test whether any of the approved antagonists of il-1 tnf il-6 il-12 il-17 gm-csf and ifn would prove useful to manage severe covid-19 patients however it is appropriate to note that anti-cytokine therapies based on the use of neutralizing antibodies or filters to remove circulating proteins have failed to improve mortality in sepsis and at this stage its unclear why covid-19 would be the exception there is also a significant population of patients with immune-mediated conditions who are currently treated with antagonists of tnf il-1 il-12il-23 and il-17 and knowing whether these interventions influence the outcome of sars-cov-2 may help to identify those cytokines that are pathological there are also significant concerns that cytokine neutralization would interfere with antiviral responses or lead to increased complications associated with other respiratory pathogens nevertheless sophisticated approaches to identify disease endotypes may provide new opportunities to revisit when to deploy immunomodulatory therapies as has been done retrospectively for the use of il-1ra in sepsis shakoory et al 2016 it may be beneficial to develop strategies to target cytokine-induced injury in the vascular compartment while maintaining cytokine signaling in the tissues that are essential for host defense it is also too early to understand whether patients who survived severe forms of covid-19 infection will have long-term sequelae that are similar to those associated with sepsis survivors the reports of pediatric patients who develop a post-sars-cov-2 multi-system inflammatory syndrome that includes vascular inflammation highlights this issuethere is a natural arc to the induction and resolution of an immune response and its magnitude and duration is coordinated by an array of regulatory checks and balances disruption of this arc can lead to hyper responses or a delay in the resolution phase and elevated or sustained cytokine production can be pathological however not all cytokine storms are the same and there are many variablesthe nature of the insult host immune status tissue affected crosstalk with immune thrombosis and complement activationthat influence the magnitude and kinetics of these responses and thus clinical manifestations nevertheless there are numerous mechanisms that allow a host to tolerate survive and even thrive in the face of immune stressors and understanding these natural processes may be useful to design ways to manage distinct forms of crs at the time of writing we still do not know enough to state with confidence that a bona fide cytokine storm underlies covid-19 pathologies but the rapid progress in immune phenotyping these patients will help our scientific community understand the complexities of this disease perhaps research on covid-19 will provide impetus to understand the consequences of dysregulated immunity in the vascular compartment and the development of strategies that target cytokines complement and coagulation to improve management of other forms of sepsiscorticosteroids could be used to suppress the cytokine storm and have been used in some patients 1 however based on the evidence from patients with mers and ards the use of corticosteroids did not provide a survival benefit but rather delayed the clearance of the virus therefore the systemic use of corticosteroids is not recommended by the who guidance 1 as a result alternatives for dampening the overwhelming cytokine release are requiredas we know the cytokine storm also occurs in other settings in patients with leukemia or lymphoma who receive chimeric antigen receptor car t cells therapy cytokine release syndrome crs occurs during and after the infusion of car t cells 8 in patients receiving car t cells therapy those with crs had elevated concentrations of interferon  tumor necrosis factor  interleukin il-1b il-2 il-6 il-7 il-8 il-10 il-12 granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor gm-csf and macrophage inflammatory protein mip-1 the cytokine profile in crs related to car t cells infusion is similar to that in cases of sars-cov-2 infection the anti-il-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab is effective in controlling car t cells infusion related crs response rate 5369 9 the above evidence provides us with a rationale for using tocilizumab to manage the cytokine storm in patients with sars-cov-2 infection another rationale for using tocilizumab to treat covid-19 is that il-6 does not enhance the antiviral immunity but decreases the antiviral immunity in patients with covid-19 diao et al found that serum il-6 was negatively correlated with t cell numbers 10 mazzoni et al found that the elevation of il-6 serum levels was associated with the impairment of cytotoxic activity in patients with covid-19 and the use of tocilizumab restored the cytotoxic potential of nk cells 11 some studies involving off-label use of tocilizumab have shown the potential efficacy of this drug in the treatment of covid-19 1215another potential drug that could be considered to treat cytokine storm is etoposide which is used to deplete monocytes and suppress cytokine release in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh 16 it needs to be mentioned that in sars-cov-infected mice inflammatory monocyte-macrophage responses were involved in causing lethal pneumonia suggesting the importance of suppressing monocyte-macrophage system in treating severe pneumonia related to sars-cov 17 the hyperactivation of monocytesmacrophages has been described in patients with covid-19 single-cell analysis of bronchoalveolar fluid revealed significantly increased proportions of mononuclear phagocytes in patients with covid-19 especially those with severe disease in patients with severe disease these mononuclear phagocytes showed a predominance of inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages 18 these macrophages could not only contribute to acute inflammation but also promote fibrosis generation additionally a significant increase of cd14cd16 monocytes was also detected in patients with severe covid-19 19 these cd14cd16 monocytes expressed il-6 and caused the acceleration of the inflammation therefore etoposide could be used to inhibit the hyperactivation of monocytesmacrophages to suppress the overwhelming inflammation and ameliorate the pulmonary fibrosis other potential drugs for treating cytokine storm include the jak12 inhibitor ruxolitinib which is effective in inhibiting monocyte activation and cytokine release in patients with hlh 20 a prospective randomized study has shown the promising efficacy of ruxolitinib in the treatment of severe covid-19 21 in this trial the ruxolitinib group showed a significant decrease of levels of 7 cytokines compared to the control group suggesting ruxolitinib suppress the cytokine storm in patients with severe covid-19 patients in the ruxolitinib group also had a faster chest ct improvement and a faster recovery from lymphopenia ruxolitinib was also well-tolerated in patients with severe covid-19 indicating ruxolitinib could be safely used to treat patients with covid-19 21 additionally therapeutic plasma exchange can reduce the plasma cytokine concentrations rapidly and has been successfully used to treat hlh and crs related to car t cells infusion 22 23 suggesting plasma exchange may be a reasonable option for severe patients with cytokine storm in a preliminary study therapeutic plasma exchange reduced the plasma il-6 level and improved the oxygenation status in patients with severe covid-19 who had ards 24although we admit that supportive care and antiviral therapy remain the mainstay for treating patients with covid-19 we recommend that treatments for controlling cytokine storm including tocilizumab etoposide ruxolitinib and plasma exchange should be considered in selected covid-19 patients with cytokine storm some pilot studies have shown promising results some other treatments may also be effective in controlling the cytokine storm more randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate if these treatments could reduce the mortality of patients with covid-19ym lf and j-yl drafted the manuscript all authors contributed to the article and approved the submitted versionthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestmounting evidence supports the notion that morbidity and mortality during sars-cov-2 infections are driven by the exacerbated immune response to the virus leading to a cascade of events involving a cytokine storm acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and eventual myocardial damage and multi-organ failure34

35 this pathological cascade is similar to that observed in other lethal lung viral infections in which the presence of the virus in the lungs triggers a first wave of cytokines including type i and iii interferons ifns activation and recruitment of immune cells leading to further production of cytokines and chemokines exacerbated immune activation and progressive shutdown of respiratory function36
cytokine storms also known as cytokine release syndrome crs or hypercytokinemia have been described as drivers of pathology in myriad infectious and non-infectious diseases36 among infectious diseases cytokine storms have been postulated to drive mortality during severe viral infections such as influenza37 including the 1918 spanish flu epidemic38 and the h5n1 bird flu39 as well as the 2003 sars epidemic40 hantavirus41 ebola42 and smallpox43 in the specific case of covid-19 independent reports indicate that the magnitude of the cytokine storm correlates positively with the severity of pathology likelihood of needing intensive care and death many inflammatory markers cytokines and chemokines have been found to be significantly associated with worse prognosis including c-reactive protein crp interleukin-6 il-6 il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor g-csf interferon -induced protein 10 ip-10 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein-1a mip-1a and tumor necrosis factor  tnf-34

35 when integrated with the current understanding of the role of cytokine storms in other respiratory infections these findings support the notion of combined antiviral treatments and targeted immunosuppression as a therapeutic strategy in covid-1944 there are now multiple clinical trials testing the impact of targeted immunosuppressants such as inhibitors of il-6 signaling eg tocilizumab sarilumab tnf- signaling eg humira il-1 signaling eg anakinra and janus kinase jak inhibitors eg ruxolitinib baricitinib tofacitinib in the hope that attenuating the cytokine storm will improve prognosisthe exact mechanisms by which trisomy 21 causes the immune dysregulation observed in people with ds remains to be elucidated however several genes encoded on chromosome 21 have established roles in immune control and their overexpression could contribute to the general immune phenotype of ds most prominent among the immune regulators encoded on chromosome 21 are four of the six interferon receptors the two type i ifn receptors ifnar1 and ifnar2 the type ii ifn receptor ifngr2 and il10rb which serves as a receptor subunit for both type iii ifn ligands and the cytokines il-10 il-22 and il-2645
several lines of evidence demonstrate the hyperactivation of ifn signaling in ds first the ifn receptors ifnrs encoded on chromosome 21 are overexpressed in multiple cell types of individuals with trisomy 21 this overexpression is obvious not only at the mrna level in multiple immune and non-immune cell types figure 1
46 but also at the cell surface level as demonstrated by a recent mass cytometry analysis of 100 different immune cell types21 second immune and non-immune cell types of people with ds are hypersensitive to ifn stimulation as demonstrated by the super-induction of downstream jakstat signaling and ifn-stimulated genes isgs20

21

47 48 49 50 51 52 53 third transcriptome analyses have revealed gene expression signatures indicative of hyperactive ifn signaling in diverse immune and non-immune cell types of people with ds20

21

46 as well as brain tissue of diverse mouse models of ds carrying triplication of the ifnr cluster54 in addition many independent studies have revealed changes indicative of chronic autoinflammation in people with ds including the elevation of many cytokines and chemokines known to act downstream of ifn signaling18 19 20

47 of critical importance to the topic of cytokine storms people with ds show significantly elevated levels of key cytokines such as crp il-6 il-2 tnf- ip-10 il-10 and mcp-119

20

47 to further strengthen this point i include here data demonstrating that individuals with ds display signs of a mild cytokine storm even in the absence of any obvious infections figure 2
 httpexplorertrisomeorgproteome lastly metabolomics studies of both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid have revealed that individuals with ds display dysregulation of the ifn-inducible kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism leading to elevated levels of quinolinic acid a neurotoxic tryptophan catabolite47 the reduction of the copy number of ifnrs reversed this metabolic dysregulation in vitro pointing to ifnr triplication as the driving eventthis body of evidence indicates that the ifn response which is key for both mounting antiviral responses and initiating and amplifying the cytokine storm is much more active in people with ds given this knowledge several questions then arise what is the likely impact of sars-cov-2 infections on the immune response of individuals with ds are individuals with trisomy 21 more or less likely to develop a severe cytokine storm and downstream pathologyat first glance ifn hyperactivity may be considered beneficial in the sense that it may enable cells with trisomy 21 to mount a stronger antiviral response during the first contact with sars-cov-2 as the first viral particles enter lung epithelial cells of an individual with trisomy 21 the consequent production of type i and type iii ifn ligands may elicit a stronger response in neighboring epithelial cells and resident immune cells overexpressing ifnrs in theory this stronger initial response could restrain viral spread this potentially beneficial aspect would result in a lower rate of sars-cov-2 carriers among those with trisomy 21 however covs have developed strategies to evade the antiviral effects of the ifn response studies of the sars-cov-1 and the middle east respiratory syndrome cov mers-cov have revealed that their genomes encode an unusual number of proteins that dampen or neutralize the ifn signaling cascade reviewed in kindler et al55 which enables viral disguise immune evasion and rapid viral replication and spread since sars-cov-2 is a member of the betacoronavirus clade which also includes sars-cov-1 and mers-cov it is likely that sars-cov-2 uses a similar suite of anti-ifn strategies56 therefore the ifn hyperactivity observed in people with ds may not be sufficient in providing additional protection against sars-cov-2 infection in the event that sars-cov-2 evades the initial immune response of a person with trisomy 21 by dampening ifn signaling the lifelong chronic ifn hyperactivity experienced by these individuals is likely to prime the immune system for super-induction of the cytokine storm in support of this notion type i ifn signaling was found to be detrimental in a mouse model of sars-cov-1 infection and pathology57 in which deletion of one of the type i ifnrs encoded on chromosome 21 ifnar1 prevented the development of sars pathology while there are no data on animal models of sars-cov-2 to address the role of ifnr copy number and assuming the two related viruses provoke similar pathological cascades it follows then that the exacerbated type i ifn signaling observed in ds would contribute to exacerbated covid-19 pathology figure 3
there is evidence to support the notion that upon confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection individuals with ds are more likely to develop a stronger and more prolonged cytokine storm figure 3during respiratory viral infections as viral particles enter the lung tissue lung-resident respiratory dendritic cells rdcs acquire antigens from the epithelial cells or are infected themselves thus being activated and draining to mediastinal and cervical lymph nodes where they process viral antigens and present them to naive circulating t cells reviewed in channappanavar et al58 upon t cell receptor tcr engagement by peptide-major histocompatibility complex mhc complexes on the surface of rdcs t cells become activated proliferate and migrate to the infected lung tissue once in the lung virus-specific effector t cells contribute to the cytokine storm by producing several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines ifn- tnf- il-2 c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 9 cxcl9 and ip-10 which in turn recruit more innate and adaptive immune cells in a careful analysis of lymphocyte recruitment to the lungs of sars-cov-1-infected mice three patterns of immune cell infiltrates were identified in lung tissue59 plasmacytoid dendritic cells pdcs infiltrated the lung early on first wave this was followed by a second wave of natural killer nk t cells nk cells macrophages and cd4 t cells finally a third wave involved neutrophils and cd8 t cells in this experimental model sars-cov-1 infection induced an enhanced virus-specific t cell response in the lungs which coincided with the development of pneumonitis and viral clearance furthermore the depletion of cd4 t cells resulted in diminished virus-specific antibody responses and decreases in the production of th1 and th2 cytokines in the lungwithin this framework given the clear signs of pro-inflammatory changes in dcs monocyte lineages nk cells and effector t cells isolated from individuals with ds20

21 it is then predicted that the cascade of events described above will be exacerbated and driven toward a stronger cytokine stormfirst when the whole blood of children with ds is exposed to live influenza a virus the production of tnf- il-1 il-6 il-8 ifn- and ifn- is significantly elevated relative to their typical siblings60 however in this in vitro experiment viral clearance was equivalent in both groups the authors concluded that the production of higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines may be responsible for a more severe clinical course of viral disease in these childrensecond deep mapping of the immune system of adults with ds revealed many changes indicative of an enhanced pro-inflammatory state in the monocyte lineage and among dcs21 the monocyte lineage in ds is driven toward the intermediate and non-classical states associated with inflammatory conditions and diverse dc subsets show alterations consistent with a heightened state of inflammation and cytotoxic potential21 thus it is predicted that the pro-inflammatory state of these myeloid cell types in ds will contribute to enhanced cytokine production as sars-cov-2 particles cross the lung epithelium and encounter resident alveolar macrophages and dcsthird within the t cell compartment t cell lineages of adults with ds show clear signs of differentiation and hyperactivation even in the absence of any obvious infections which could be explained by chronic ifn hyperactivity20 when the cd4 and cd8 t cells of adults with ds are activated ex vivo via stimulation of the tcr akin to what occurs during a viral infection they overproduce many key cytokines and chemokines20 upon activation cd4 t cells with trisomy 21 overproduce il-10 il-17a il-22 and mip-3 and cd8 t cells overproduce tnf- ifn- il-2 mip-1 gm granulocyte-macrophage-csf il-8 mip-1 and eotaxin20 thus the t cells of people with ds are likely to fuel a stronger cytokine storm as they infiltrate the infected lung epitheliain addition it has been shown that effector cd4 and cd8 t cells with trisomy 21 are resistant to suppression by regulatory t cells tregs20 tregs are key players during the resolution of an infection by dampening the action of effector cd4 and cd8 t cells once the virus has been cleared however effector t cells of people with ds were found to be refractory to dampening by tregs after activation which results in more proliferation of effector t cells relative to euploid counterparts20 although tregs with trisomy 21 were found to be capable of suppressing effector t cells of typical people they could not suppress effector t cells with trisomy 21 pointing again to a hyperactive resilient state of effector t cells in ds20 as the immune system of a person with ds attacks sars-cov-2-infected cells it is predicted that the t cell response including cytokine overproduction will be stronger and last longer this may be further exacerbated by additional pro-inflammatory changes in the nk cells of adults with ds21
overall this evidence supports the notion that covid-19 in ds will display a stronger cytokine storm and accelerated onset of cytokine-driven pathology figure 3it is well documented that pandemics of respiratory viral infections are followed by a surge in cases of bacterial pneumonia supporting the notion of a post-viral state of bacterial pneumonia susceptibility61

62 in fact most influenza-related deaths are due to secondary infections with bacteria commonly found in the nasopharyngeal tract such as streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus62

63 during the spanish flu pandemic of 19181919 90 of deaths were attributed to subsequent bacterial pneumonia64

65 during later influenza pandemics in the 1950s and 1960s the percentage of deaths due to bacterial lung infections was estimated at 5070 with the decreases being explained by the broader use of antibiotics66

67 in the covid-19 pandemic the impact of secondary bacterial infections is likely to be further decreased by the widespread use of broadly acting antibiotics such as azithromycin however secondary bacterial infections remain a concern particularly for individuals with dsof importance to secondary infections in ds the production of type i ifns during the antiviral response was shown to drive the increased risk of secondary bacterial infections in mouse models knockout of one of the type i ifnrs encoded on chromosome 21 improved the survival and clearance of s pneumoniae68 the harmful effects of type i ifn signaling seem to be driven by the impairment of macrophage andor neutrophil function by ifn-induced cytokines most prominently among them the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-1069

70
il-10 is involved in the dampening and resolution of immune response and is consistently elevated at baseline in people with ds19 figure 3 furthermore one of the subunits of the il-10 receptor il10rb is encoded by one of the four genes in the ifnr cluster on chromosome 21 il10rb serves as a subunit not only for the il-10 receptor but also for the type iii ifns il-22 and the il-26 receptors71 these findings beg the question what would be the impact of elevated il-10 signaling in ds at this point all of the evidence supports the notion that elevated il-10 signaling in ds does not suffice to bring balance to what is clearly a hyperactive overresponsive immune system in our analysis of the t cells of people with ds we observed that cd8 t cells with trisomy 21 overproduce il-10 upon stimulation and they also overproduce many more pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- ifn- mip-1 il-2 il-8 mip-1 and eotaxin20 however the suppressive effects of il-10 on the antibacterial branch of the immune system could increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections62

70 the role of il-10 in this phenomenon has been well investigated for pneumococcal pneumonia and tuberculosis in a mouse model of influenza a treatment with anti-il-10 neutralizing antibodies before inoculation with s pneumoniae resulted in reduced bacterial outgrowth and reduced lethality during secondary bacterial pneumonia70 in the case of tuberculosis type i ifn signaling was shown to actually promote mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterial expansion and pathogenesis72 which was explained by the ifn-dependent induction of il-10 and consequent impairment in bacterial killing73
these observations support the notion that type i ifn hyperactivity and increased downstream il-10 signaling could be drivers of the known susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia in people with ds children with ds have a 60-fold higher rate of pneumonia than do typical children74 and bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in adults with ds75 several reports have documented impaired neutrophil function in ds76 77 78 therefore it is predicted that individuals with covid-19 and ds would be at a higher risk of secondary bacterial lung infections during the covid-19 pandemicthe evidence outlined above indicates that covid-19 in ds would present accelerated progression toward dyspnea ards and myocardial damage with a potential increased risk of secondary bacterial infections in addition the impact of immune dysregulation in ds could be modulated by other potential risk factorspeople with ds have a unique profile of cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary disease79 nearly 50 of newborns with ds are affected by some form of congenital heart disease chd which in many cases requires repair via heart surgery80 however adults with ds seem to be protected from coronary heart disease81 this duality in the cardiac phenotype makes it hard at this point to assess the impacts of chd on the development of covid-19 in ds while it is likely that mild viable unrepaired chd will be a risk factor for severe covid-19 the assessment is less clear for those individuals who have undergone effective repair via cardiac surgery and have otherwise normal cardiac functionin addition diverse anatomic abnormalities of the upper airway are considered major risk factors for respiratory infections in ds82 83 84 dysphagia and aspiration which are more common in ds could also increase the predisposition to lung infection in this population85

86 in addition to these structural factors hypotonia can increase the likelihood of proximal airway obstruction and dysphagia in ds83

86 obstructive sleep apnea osa which is very common in people with ds87

88 can often cause chronic intermittent hypoxia and respiratory acidosis which in turn can drive pulmonary hypertension a condition that is also more common in ds89

90 therefore osa could indirectly create an additional risk factor for the severity of covid-19 by accelerating hypoxemia predisposing to pulmonary hypertension and decreasing cardiopulmonary capacity while some studies support the notion that osa is a risk factor for ards in some settings91

92 other studies suggest that obesity which is associated with osa may be a higher risk factor for ards than osa itself93 in the context of covid-19 chronic lung disease and obesity are recognized risk factors but the autonomous impact of osa specifically remains to be fully elucidatedin summary in addition to the risks imposed by the immune dysregulation caused by trisomy 21 other risk factors could contribute to a more severe form of covid-19 in dsoverall the combination of immune dysregulation and other potential risk factors suggest that individuals with ds and confirmed sars-cov-2 infection should undergo closer monitoring including rapid real-time monitoring of inflammatory markers eg crp il-6 tnf- myocardial damage eg brain natriuretic peptide cardiac troponin myoglobin and secondary bacterial infections as more clinical trials for targeted immunosuppressants are performed around the world individuals with ds are prime candidates for this intervention and other approaches to tone down the cytokine stormclearly in the absence of clinical and epidemiological data to define the impact of covid-19 in the population with ds this perspective and the hypotheses stated herein should be approached with skepticism nevertheless i hope that this analysis of the literature prompts physicians around the world to pay special attention to individuals with ds and adopt measures to counteract the effects of the cytokine storm and other potential risk factors in this populationcoronaviruses the positive-sense enveloped rna virus with 2632 kb genome belong to the coronaviridae family of viruses capable of infecting both humans and other animals1 virus infection affects both the respiratory and digestive systems of the host human coronavirus hcov can be categorized into two depending on their pathogenic capability hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 hcov-229e and hcov-hku are viruses that are included in low pathogenic hcov group that predominantly leads to infection in the upper respiratory tracts and results in common cold-like symptoms while severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and the lately recognized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2sars-cov-2coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 are highly pathogenic hcovs 23 unlike low pathogenic hcov these highly pathogenic viruses have increased disease severity and death rate because of its ability to infect lower respiratory tract leading to clinical features like pneumonia acute lung injury ali and ards 4 also sars cov2 showed 790 genome identity to sarscov and 50 to mers cov 5 similar to mers and sars covs bats are considered as natural host of sars cov2 the virus is then transmitted via intermediate host to human the intermediate host for mers cov sars cov and sars cov2 were identified as dromedary camels civets and pangolins respectively 6viral entry into the host results in activation of innate immune mechanism together with the synthesis and secretion of inflammatory mediators interaction of specific viral components with pattern recognition receptors of the host immune system activates cellular signalling pathways that culminate in the production of various cytokines these cytokines elicit host response like extravasation of leukocytes and activation proliferation and cell differentiation of adaptive and innate immune system 78 interleukin il-1 il-18 and il-6 tumor necrosis factor tnf- interferon ifn- transforming growth factortgf- are the major cytokines while ccl-2monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp-1 mcp-3 ccl-3macrophage inflammatory protein mip-1 ccl-5 chemokine c-c motif ligand 5rantes regulated on activation normal t cell expressed and secreted and ifn--inducible protein-10 ip-10cxcl10 c-x-c motif chemokine 10 are the chemokines released during an influenza virus-induced infection 910 these cytokines exert host antiviral responses in different ways ifn- is a type 1 interferon that can inhibit viral replication thus inducing a potent antiviral state in the host 11 while tnf- triggers the immune cells localization at infection site and activation of caspases to promote apoptosis 12 il-1 is a pleiotropic cytokine which enhances inflammatory cell infiltration by increasing membrane permeability through activation of mast cells and subsequent release of histamine a vasodilator 13 il-6 mediates monocyte differentiation to macrophages and enhances mononuclear cell infiltration to the inflammation loci 14 moreover synergistically il-6 and tgf- induces maturation of naive helper t cells cd4 to t helper 17 th17 cells which are potential effectors against pathogens interestingly il-6 also hinders the treg expansion by tgf- 1516 enhancement of type 1 immunity activation of natural killer t cells nkt cells thus forming an early line of defence against viral infection are some of the biological actions of il-18 during viral infection 1718although these cytokines are released either as host protection or response against viral entry exacerbated cytokine release can adversely affect the host by overreacting to its own system organs named as cytokine storm and was observed in both sars and mers infection resulting in the associated severe complications and multiple organ failure 19 studies have established that similar hypercytokinemiacytokine storm is also taking part in sars-cov2covid-19 infection in this review we highlight the pathology and pathogenesis of mers cov sars cov and sars cov2 with main focus into the role of cytokines in pathology and its relation with co-morbidities of covid-19 infection 20according to who the middle east respiratory syndrome mers was observed in 2494 individuals and has a 344 case-fatality rate as of november 2019 r0 was estimated to be less than 1 indicating less transmissibility of virus 37 mers was reported in 27 countries globally the higher risk age group was 5059 years and mostly men were infected who 2019 httpapplicationsemrowhointdocsemrpub-csr-241-2019-enpdfua1ua1ua1 similar to sars-cov the early clinical indications of infection by mers-cov include cough dyspnea fever and myalgia which were then followed by the development of pneumonia in addition to symptoms associated with the respiratory system patients infected with mers-cov also experienced diarrhoea vomiting and abdominal pain interstitial infiltrates were observed in chest radiography of mers-cov infected individuals laboratory investigation showed increased concentration of ldh and aspartate aminotransferase ast low eosinophil and platelet count and decreased albumin level 38dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 or cd26 a cell surface protein is the functional receptor for mers-cov to enter host cells compared to other coronavirus mers-cov exhibits a wide range of in vitro tissue tropism because of the wide expression of dpp4 in different tissues like epithelial cells in the kidney small intestine alveoli prostate liver and activated t lymphocytes 39 in lungs dpp4 is expressed in multinucleated epithelial cells submucosal gland cells and bronchial pneumocytes but not in upper airway epithelium 40 additionally mers-cov can infect monocyte-derived-dendritic cells and macrophages when compared with sars-cov28 ultra-structural finding of mers infected patients showed the presence of viral particles in pneumocytes pulmonary and skeletal muscles macrophages and renal proximal tubular epithelial cells 41 furthermore up-regulation of smad7 and fgf2 fibroblast growth factor 2 expressions in kidney and lung by merscov resulted in cell death and tissue damage 42 infection of t cells of peripheral blood spleen and tonsils with mers cov resulted in activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways leading to cell death bear out the observation of lymphopenia in mers infection 43 moreover patients with co-morbidities like diabetes cardiovascular diseases end-stage renal disease and hypertension were more prone to fatal conditions 44blood cytokine analysis performed in severely infected mers individuals demonstrated a marked increase in concentration of il-6 il-10 il-15 ip-10 il-17 tnf and ifn- 2 in comparison to controls 4445 additionally significantly increased mrna expression of il-8 il-12 ifn- rantes ip-10 mcp-1 and mip-1 were seen in human macrophages infected by mers-cov 46 suggesting that these cytokines are implicated in the infiltration of immune cell in lungs leading to hyper inflammation and finally progress to lung injurythe first documented case of covid19 was in december 2019 from the wuhan city of china httpswwwwhointdocsdefault-sourcecoronavirusesituation-reports20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncovpdfsfvrsn20a99c104 and as of 22 june 2020 8860331 individuals were reported as sars-cov-2 positive resulting in the death of 465740 patients and have already affected 216 countries and regional territories globally thus sars-cov-2 pandemic fit in to the very high-risk category and has crossed statistics of the earlier epidemics caused by sar-cov and mers-cov httpswwwwhointdocsdefault-sourcecoronavirusesituation-reports20200622-covid-19-sitrep-154pdfsfvrsnd0249d8d2 according to who estimated r0 was 2- 25 which is less than that of sars however later a review reported r0 as 328 signifying high transmission capability of virus 47initially majority of patients were presented with clinical indications like dry cough myalgia fever fatigue dyspnoea headache vomiting and diarrhoea at later stages severely infected patients showed clinical manifestations including pharyngeal pain dizziness abdominal pain and anorexia laboratory analysis of the patient samples revealed leucopenia lymphopenia high pro-thrombin time high levels of hepatic enzymes like ast ldh increased bio-markers of inflammation like erythrocyte sedimentation rate serum c-reactive protein and ferritin elderly people and those patients with underlying diseases like copd hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes belong to the high-risk group in which the disease might advance to fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome patients with sars cov2 infection showed ground-glass opacity and segmental consolidation of both lungs as patchy areas in computer-assisted tomography scan of the chest and was suffering from pneumonia other major complications of sars-cov2 infection include shock arrhythmia acute cardiac injury and secondary infection which finally need assistance by mechanical ventilation 4849like sars cov ace2 is the primary cell entry receptor for sars cov2 into its host upon priming of spike protein of virus by cellular protease like tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 2 viral fusion with the cell membrane is triggered 24 on protein structural analysis receptor binding domain rbd of s protein of sars cov2 and sars cov showed 72 amino acid sequence identity indicating the higher affinity of sars cov2 to its receptor in comparison to sars cov50 furthermore furin-like cleavage site of sars cov2 spike protein also help in its priming making the virus more contagious interestingly this furin-like cleavage site was observed in human coronavirus oc43 and mers but not in sars cov 51 infection with cytopathic virus like sars-cov-2 results in inflammasome formation and pyroptosis mediated by caspase1 activation and associated inflammatory response 52covid-19 infected patients showed higher concentration of peripheral blood

il-2 il-6 il-7 ip-10 il-2r il-10 tnf- mip-1 mcp-1 and gscf levels positively correlated with disease severity suggesting that hypercytokinemia can aggravate immunopathology and inflammation 4853 54 55only a few in vitro studies have been published so far on covid-19 and cytokine deregulation based on available medical and in vitro data it can be observed that there is a significant distinguishable pattern in the cytokine storm of covid-19 with sars-cov and mers-cov infection fig 1
 only three cytokines viz il-6 ip-10 and ifn- showed markedly elevated levels in all three highly pathogenic hcov infections in sars patients the level of ip -10 correlated with disease severity 31 it has been also shown that ip-10 induction in lungs leads to immune cell infiltration and apoptosis causing acute lung injury in sars 30 moreover increased levels of ip-10 were also associated with disease progression in mers-cov patients and continual high level as a sign of poor outcome 44 increased expression of mig and ip-10 chemo attractants that enlist activated t cells by chemokine receptor cxcr3 signalling was observed in inflammation specifically in activated bronchial epithelium 56 sars cov infection mice model showed up-regulation of ip-10 mig and its receptor in the lungs implicating the relevance of cxcr3 cascade to the development of ards in sars cov 57 enhanced cxcr3 signalling was previously reported with aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis 58 recent study on covid-19 reported that elevated levels of nasopharyngeal ip-10 can be used as a new biomarker for undiagnosed covid-19 case 59 this indicates the importance of ip-10 and its signalling in the progression to pneumonia and ultimately the fatality of covid-19 patients recent ex vivo experiment conducted in human lung tissue to address the viral features like high transmissibility and asymptomatic infection of sars-cov2 by inoculating sars-cov-2 or sars cov showed an increased capacity of sars-cov2 in infecting and replicating in human lung tissues more vigorously than sars-cov suggesting the existence of increased viral load in airway secretions seen in covid-19 patients even in the incubation period however sars-cov2 did not induce significant ifns type i ii iii and pro-inflammatory mediators except ip-10 in the human lung tissues ex vivo human lung tissue is not a perfect representative for host immune response this data of decreased inflammatory mediators contradict with existing reports of increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines even in moderately ill covid-19 patients 60 in another study peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc and balf transcriptome sequencing of sars-cov-2 infected patient revealed enrichment of mcp-1 ip-10 mip-1a and mip1b genes of note sars-cov-2 also induced apoptosis and p53 signalling pathways implicating the laboratory finding of lymphopenia in covid-19 patients 61another major cytokine that mediate organ damage in cytokine storm is il-6 excessive secretion of il-6 results in activation of coagulation pathway conversion of naive t cells increase in vascular permeability and reduced cardiac function contribute to the increased disease severity 6263 sars patients also showed increased levels of il-6 which correlated with disease progression 30 increased levels of th17 cd4 t cells seen in covid-19 patients can be explained by high levels of il-6 which is implicated in t helper 17 th17 cells development 1664 interestingly spike protein of sars cov induced activation of nf-b signalling resulting in il-6 and tnf- secretion in murine macrophages 65 later in another study reported that inhibiting nf-b signalling was demonstrated with decreased il-6 levels and increased animal survival in sars 66 these studies implicate il-6 to be a key contributor to the patho-physiology of the cytokine-storm seen in both the sars cov infections one of the proposed mechanisms for decreased t cells in covid-19 infection could be mediated by increased levels of il-6 and increased interaction between fas and its ligand moreover an increased number of lymphocytes were observed in patients sars cov2 infection when treated with tocilizumab the il-6 receptor antagonist 6768 yet more studies are required for speculating the exact mechanism of sars cov2 induced lymphopenia and other immunological featuresas depicted in fig 1 altered mcp-1 il-2 mig and il-8 levels were observed in both sars cov and sars cov2 infected patients thus cytokine storm in sars-cov2 infection has been linked with both th1 which is mediated by ifn- ip-10 il-1  mcp-1 il-2 and th2 response mediated by il-10 48 which is different from that of sars-cov in which no change occurs in th2 cytokines 33 compared to sars cov more number of cytokines and chemokines are involved in the immune pathology of covid-19 common cytokine increased among sars cov2 and mers was il-10 ip-10 il-6 and tnf- speculating that sars cov2 show less similarity with mers cov even in eliciting an immune response when compared to sars cov these differences in cytokine release pattern by each pathogenic hcovs imply about the uniqueness in eliciting immune response and pathogenesis based on these observations it is reasonable to suggest that an increased response of th1 cytokines th2 cytokines and pro-inflammatory chemokines contribute to the immune pathology of covid-19 infection in contrast to sars which was predominantly mediated by ifn- induced th1 response 69 another study also demonstrated that covid-19 patients were presented with defective interferon activation and enhanced nfb mediated tnf- and il-6 production 70 moreover sars cov2 infection was also associated with defective ifn1 expression like sars cov this was confirmed by blancomelo et al on their experiments in ferret model infected cell line primary bronchial cells and serum cytokine profiling the authors have shown delayed ifn type1 and 111 expression along with increased levels of chemokines 55 single-cell sequencing scrna-seq of covid-19 patients showed impaired immune response by activation of pro-inflammatory signalling pathways in lung samples 71 these findings speculate that the combined action of exaggerated cytokine levels and defective antiviral innate immune response by interferons results in deterioration of sars cov2 infection interferon therapy for covid-19 patients has already been suggested 72 and findings of a clinical trial with interferon-2b have shown promising results 73 further studies will have to be performed to reveal the actual immune mechanism behind the pathogenesis and cytokine storm-induced hyper-inflammation during the disease comparative analysis of sars cov mers cov and sars cov2 is summarised in table 1
although the occurrence of copd in covid-19 patients was reported as 32 74 the rate of disease severity and the mortality rate was markedly high with 60 and 63 respectively 75increasing the adverse effect of covid-19 by 59 fold 76 this data have to be stratified based on the cause and difference stages of copd interestingly current smokers tend to develop morecovid-19 associated complications compared to non-smokers and the collective frequency of smokers with covid-19 is 9 75 chronic exposure to environmental pollution smoking and other irritants eventually end up in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd main characteristic features of copd include inflammation of lung parenchyma obstruction in airflow pulmonary emphysema and chronic bronchitis 77 damage of epithelial cells results in the excessive infiltration of monocytesneutrophils and cytotoxic t lymphocytes cd8 t-cell to peripheral airways and lung parenchyma and consequent release of inflammatory mediators like chemokines cytokines and other proteases 78 spill over of these inflammatory mediators from airway inflammation to systemic circulation further results in systemic inflammation and associated manifestations a complex network of cytokines has been implicated in the inflammatory process of copd prominent cytokines elevated in both plasma and sputum samples of copd patients were il-18 vegf il-6 il-1 tnf- and il8 79 80 81 82molecular mechanisms of disease were discovered using the protein-protein interaction ppi network analysis ppi interaction studies conducted by kumar spotted out cxcr4 tnf ccl5 ccl2 ifn- cxcl8 il-6 il-10 icam1 cxcl1 as the major genes involved in the copd high-risk group of covid-19 indicating the importance of cytokine signalling as one of the pathogenesis in copd patients with covid-19 83 additionally ace2 the entry point of sars cov2 expression was upregulated in lower airways epithelium of smokers and copd patients suggesting the increased entry of virus making them more vulnerable for the virus 84 thus underlying deregulated immune system with increased levels of cytokines and subsequent inflammation in copd superimpose sars cov2 induced hypercytokinemia further aggravating the fatality in the copd risk group of covid-19 patientsa pooled analysis conducted by lippi g et al identified increased fatal conditions in covid-19 infected hypertensive patients by 25 fold 85 the development and progression of hypertension are under inherent and acquired immune surveillance triggers like angiotensin ii excessive salt diet etc could induce activation and permeation of various immune cells in kidneys heart and blood vessels the inflammatory mediators released by these cells culminate in vascular injury and inflammation 86 several studies have identified the profound role of il-1 il-6 il-8 il-17 il-18 il-23 ifn- tnf- and tgf- in the inflammatory pathogenesis of hypertension 87 an increased concentration of il-2 ifn- il-8 il-1 mcp-1 vegf epidermal growth factor and tnf- was observed in the serum of hypertensive patients 88 additionally il-4 and il-10 anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were notably lower in hypertensive patients in comparison to control subjects suggesting a skewed th1 th2 and th17 immune response stemming in the inflammatory pathogenesis of hypertension 8889 as discussed earlier covid-19 patients were shown to have high levels of il-1 mcp-1 il-6 il-2 tnf- and il-8 as these cytokines were also found to be increased in hypertension their role in deterioration of covid19 infection is suggestivemoreover the role of the ras in pathology of hypertension is well described and type 1 at1 angiotensin ii ang ii receptor blockers arbs and angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors are given for hypertensive patients as most important therapeutic medicines 90 in addition to the increased ace2 expression decreased viral clearance also contributes to the intensified pathological scenario in covid-19 infections 91 computational network analysis picked cxcl8 vegfa ccl2 il-10 il-6 mmp-9 tnf as key genes in hypertension high-risk covid-19 patients 83 accordingly we can put forward that low-grade chronic inflammation seen in hypertensive patients ease the cytokine storm culminating in ards and death in covid-19the death rate of covid-19 patients with cvd was 105 92 the deregulated immune system is one of the putative links between cvd and covid-19 high blood pressure hyperlipidemia insulin resistance and other factors activate complex inflammatory cascade leading to atherosclerosis chronic endothelial injury results in endothelial dysfunction with augmented vascular permeability followed by extravasation of t lymphocytes monocytes and mononuclear leukocytes this finally leads to macrophage activation foam cells formation and plaque development 9394 cytokines like il-1 il-6 pdgf il-8 ifn- tnf- and mcp-1 released from smooth muscle cells epithelial cells and immune cells of atherosclerotic plaque regulates its stability by modulating smooth muscle cell activity and apoptosis 9596 moreover the systemic concentrations of il-6 and il-18 are considered as a predictor of increased mortality in cvd patients 9798 cytokine network of high levels of il-18 il-1 tnf- il-8 ifn- il-6 pdgf and mcp-1 modulate inflammatory angiogenesis in cardiovascular disease 95high level of ace2 expression seen in lungs and heart suggests defective ace2- signalling pathways causing cardiac injury in covid-19 although the risk of ace inhibitors for cvd treatment in covid-19 is still on debate other possible mechanisms in relation with covid-19 and heart injury comprise excessive inflammatory response mediated by cytokine storm hypoxia caused by apoptosis of myocardial cells and respiratory failure 99 moreover top genes in cvd risk of covid-19 infection identified by network analysis of protein-protein interaction as follows tnf il-6 ccl2 ccl5 cxcl8 cxcr4 and icam1 83 thus hyperinflammation in cvd because of increased pro-inflammatory cytokines add up the negative effects of cytokine storm induced by sars cov2altered glucose homeostasis and immune imbalance could attribute to the increased susceptibility of diabetic patients for pathogens 100 ssars cov2 infected patients with diabetes had a 2 times increased risk of disease worsening and mortality compared to those with no diabetes 101 activated innate immune system and increased pro-inflammatory markers are linked with the pathogenesis of type2 diabetes t2dm and its microvascular complications like retinopathy nephropathy etc 102 these inflammatory mediators contribute to the augmentation of altered glucose metabolism insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity enhanced liver acute phase proteins synthesis and secretion and other inflammatory markers 103 tnf- mcp-1 il-6 and il-1 are prevalent cytokines that participate in the immune pathologic process of type 2 diabetes 104 additionally levels of il-4 tnf- il-7 gmcsf il-15 ifn-  il-1 tnf- il-12p70 mip-1 il-17a il-6 ip-10 il-10 mip-1 mcp-1 il-8 il-13 and il-9 and were increased in type 2 diabetic patients 105106an immune-mediated inflammatory cascade is a crucial event in type1 diabetes which involves the activation and infiltration of t lymphocytes macrophages and various other immune cells and production of inflammatory mediators in the pancreas 107 increased levels of il-1 tnf- il-23 il-1 il-10 il-17a and il-6 were seen in type1 diabetic patients 108 109 110 study conducted in non-obese diabetic mice model showed ifn- can inhibit il-10 induction thereby altering t cell regulation 111hence the basic levels of il-18 mcp-1 il-1 tnf- mip-1 ip-10 il-6 il-8 and mip-1 were high in diabetic patients with covid-19 and sars cov2 infection was associated with increased level of above mentioned cytokines the exuberant cytokines can be one of the cause of the severity and worsening in state of covid19 patients with diabetes patients suffering from type 1 or type 2 diabetes are given treatment of arbs and ace inhibitors this leads to increased ace2 expression in diabetic patients aiding sars cov2 infection in them 90 tnf cxcl8 il-10 ccl2 icam1 ifn- il-2 cxcr4 were the key genes identified by ppi network analysis for the covid-19 diabetic high-risk group 83 as described earlier diabetes is associated with hyperglycemia increased coagulation state altered immune system intense inflammatory response with heightened release of pro-inflammatory cytokines 112 facilitates sars cov2 induced cytokine storm that contribute to the disease severity of covid19 patientstill now only one report shows gestational diabetes mellitus gdm as a comorbidity in two pregnant women who died because of covid-19 infection 113 role of inflammation and insulin resistance in gdm has been well described gdm is associated with altered cytokine concentrations that further enhance maternal insulin resistance high risk of pregnancy outcome and neonatal complications 114 pro-inflammatory cytokine like il-6 tnf- il-8 and il-18 were elevated in gdm patients along with low levels of il-10 115on the basis of the above mentioned data one can envisage that elevated concentrations of these pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines in covid-19 patient with underlying risk factors furthermore intensifies the cytokine storm associated inflammation induced by sars cov2 thereby converting the cytokine-storm of covid-19 to a cytokine super cyclone fig 2
 importantly co-morbidities associated with covid-19 and sars cov2 infection have a shared cytokine profile indicating importance of anti-cytokine therapy however future projects are warranted to unveil the pathophysiological mechanisms of association between risk factors like copd hypertension cvd diabetes and covid-19 and disease managementvaccines are given to raise immune protection against specific pathogens by inducing immunological memory bacillus calmette- gurin bcg the vaccine given for protection against mycobacteria infections is administered in new-born based on several clinical trials and observational studies it has been shown that bcg vaccination could reduce the neonatal as well as childhood death rate 116117 retrospective cross-sectional study conducted in sub-saharan african children of below 5 years demonstrated a positive association of bcg vaccination and lower threat of malaria 118 additionally epidemiological studies have also established the protective role of bcg against respiratory tract infections in children which are predominantly virus-mediated 119120 vaccination with bcg enhanced ifn- and il-10 level thus providing immunity against respiratory tract infection even in elderly age group 121 this is because bcg also provides some non-specific immune assistance like immunity against pathogens other than mycobacteria like virus and parasites and reduces the occurrence of allergy this is attained through a mechanism termed as trained immunity which is the immunological recall of the innate immune system via epigenetic reprogramming 122 innate immune cells like monocytes nk cells and macrophages undergo epigenetic modifications of histones that include methylation and acetylation enhances gene expression of il-6 tnf- and il-1 upon bcg vaccination thus the trained phenotype of innate immune cells results an increase in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines on exposure to non-specific pathogen enhancing host protection 123124 it has been experimentally shown that healthy subjects immunized with bcg show increased production of tnf- and il-1 in response to bacterial and non-bacterial stimulants increased h3k4me3 trimethylation of histone h3 at lysine 4 exposed promoter regions of these pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to their increased expression 125 in another study bcg vaccination reduced viremia in experimental human yellow fever virus infection model by inducing trained immunity by epigenetic modification of monocytes resulting in increased production of il-1 126 moreover bcg could enhance heterologous th1th17 responses by inducing the long-lasting release of il-22 ifn- and il-17 thereby attaining non-specific immune response to infections 127 in line with this several in vivo studies in murine models were also reported bcg immunized mice expressed antimicrobial peptides and bestowed protection against malarial parasitemia 128 additionally prior bcg vaccination in influenza virus challenged mice were found to have considerable protection via secretion of antibody or activation of cell-mediated immunity 129 a study conducted in mice model to understand the effect of bcg against various viral infections like herpes simplex type 1 influenza a2 and encephalomyocarditis viruses showed increased resistance of bcg immunised mice against these viruses compared to control mice 130 specifically bcg vaccinated newborn mice were shown to be more resistant against herpes simplex type 2 infection 131 based on these observations it has been proposed that bcg vaccine has the potential to act as a protective agent against sars cov2 as it provides antiviral immunity 132 sars-cov2 virus enhances the generation of il-6 ifn- tnf- and il-1 in mild to severely infected patients 48 as discussed earlier the trained immunity of bcg vaccine involves the release of these cytokines thus providing an antiviral state and earlier protection against sars-cov2 fig 3
 ozdemir et al has already documented a marked decrease in the number of cases per population death per population and deaths per cases ratio of covid-19 in bcg vaccinated countries than bcg-non-vaccinated countries 133 another observational study conducted in 25 level 4 european countries found a positive correlation of bcg vaccination and decreased death rate in covid 19 but could not found any association with pneumococcal vaccine and seasonal influenza vaccination even after adjusting with several covariates like days from day 1 to lockdown life-expectancy the net migration median age case-fatality rate the proportion of the population living in an urban setting population size population density and elderly dependency ratio 134 moreover bcg vaccination protocols and bacteria strains used are different among bcg vaccinated countries 135 epidemiological analysis of bcg vaccination on covid 19 based on these data-set has to be done in future for better understanding furthermore it is also significant to study the impact of covid-19 infection in patients with co-morbidities like diabetes hypertension copd and cardiovascular disease in bcg vaccinated and non-vaccinated countries although multiple studies support the hypothesis of the generic defensive role of bcg vaccine against the covid 19 pandemic 136137 controversies have been reported on the same aspect 138139 as each study has used different data extraction indicators statistical analysis and correction with confounding variables they cannot give ultimate evidence of causality and underscore the importance of clinical trials to conclude upon the association of bcg with covid-19 infectionas of now a total of 16 clinical trials were registered in clinicaltrialsgov run by the united states national library of medicine to delineate bcg induced trained immunity protection against sars cov2 httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2resultscondcovidtermbcgcntrystatecitydist out of 16 only 8 studies started recruitment of participants among these bcg-corona reducing health care workers absenteeism in covid-19 pandemic by enhanced trained immune responses through bacillus calmette-gurin vaccination a randomized controlled trial brace bcg vaccination to reduce the impact of covid-19 in healthcare workers following coronavirus exposure bcg vaccine for health care workers as defense against covid 19 badas and bcg vaccination for healthcare workers in covid-19 pandemic are conducting their trials in healthcare workers as they are more vulnerable to covid 19 infection the primary objective of brace badas and bcg vaccination for healthcare workers in covid-19 pandemic is to analyse the occurrence and severity of covid-19 in bcg vaccinated and non vaccinated groups while bcg-corona trial is estimated to involve 1500 health workers and aims to assess whether unplanned absenteeism of these participants can be reduced by bcg vaccination in the covid-19 pandemic since existing reports regarding the protective role of bcg and covid-19 were based on observational data analysis the results of these trials are crucial to getting a definite conclusion who has not yet advised bcg immunization against sars-cov2 infection httpswwwwhointnews-roomcommentariesdetailbacille-calmette-guc3a9rin-bcg-vaccination-and-covid-19 in addition to clinical trials more epidemiological studies are required to strategize the status of co- morbidities and associated death in bcg vaccinated covid-19 cases these data are important to envisage the safeguarding nature of bcg vaccine against covid-19 as high-risk patients are more prone to the lethal effect of sars cov2virus infection leads to activation of multiple immune pathways finally culminating in virus removal from the host in rare cases the immune system gets over-activated triggering a cascade of events that is ultimately fatal for the patient uncontrolled secretion of cytokines of the innate immune system is associated with hyper inflammation and ards in covid 19 patients and is well established another important finding is that levels of cytokines correlate with disease severity interestingly increasing cytokine levels due to over-stimulated immune response upon covid-19 infection results in synergistic action of covid-19 induced cytokine-storm and cytokine-upheaval in high-risk patients with co-morbidities leading to extensively severe clinical manifestations culminating in high mortality associated with this disease while on the other hand trained immunity of bcg vaccine involves the secretion of il-1 tnf- and il-6 thus providing an antiviral state and early protection against sars-cov2dr malini laloraya is supported by department of biotechnology dbt-rajiv gandhi centre for biotechnology bsj supported by research fellowship from department of science  technology dst inspire fellowship20151f150361
betcy susan johnson formal analysis writing - original draft malini laloraya conceptualization writing - review  editing supervisionthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this papersevere coronavirus disease covid-19 caused by the sars-cov-2 virus is frequently characterized by pulmonary inflammation 1 life-threatening cytokine storms involving the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines eg tnf- il-6 il-1 il-8 and mcp-1 may contribute to the rapid systemic organ failure observed in select critically ill covid-19 patients 1 however this storm is not a self-limiting singular event sars-cov-2 causes massive cell death and cellular debris that activates inflammasomes 2 which in turn trigger a macrophage-derived eicosanoid storm a surge of pro-inflammatory bioactive lipid mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes that fuels local inflammation 35 a paradigm shift in the inflammation field is that the resolution of inflammation is an active biochemical process 5 implying that hyper-inflammation may result from a deficit in resolutionin contrast to classic anti-inflammatory agents endogenous pro-resolution lipids can terminate the inflammatory response by promoting the clearance of cellular debris specialized pro-resolving mediators spms including resolvins lipoxins and protectins are bioactive lipid autacoids that mediate endogenous resolution by stimulating macrophage phagocytosis of cellular debris and countering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokineschemokines 5 importantly loss of inflammation resolution mechanisms plays a role in sustaining pathologic inflammation 5 endogenous resolution processes have been identified in the termination of infectious diseases 5 including influenza 68 and could thus be harnessed for averting dysregulated inflammation and associated mortality in covid-19 spms promote anti-viral b lymphocytic activity in influenza 7 suggesting they may be a promising therapy for covid-19 spm precursors including 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid 17-hdha have also been identified as potentially promising vaccine adjuvants as they protect against primary influenza infection and promote adaptive immunity 7 8 thus the use of spms or their precursors in combination with covid-19 vaccines may be a novel and effective therapeutic approachthe resolution of inflammation is also stimulated by another pathway involving arachidonic acidderived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids eets these mediators promote clearance of cellular debris and activate anti-inflammatory programs to inhibit several key pro-inflammatory cytokines 9 10 eets and other epoxy fatty acids specifically promote production of spms such as lipoxins by shifting arachidonic acid metabolism to favor inflammation resolution 11 as eets are rapidly metabolized by soluble epoxide hydrolase seh administration of seh inhibitors sehis can stabilize eet levels prevent lung inflammation and improve lung function in animal models making them an attractive potential therapeutic strategy for covid-19 both spms and sehis downregulate the transcription regulator nf-b 5 11 the center of eicosanoid-induced cytokine storms which promotes the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandin synthesis via cyclooxygenase cox combined pharmacological abrogation of cox-2 and seh activity also prevents cytokine and eicosanoid storms via debris clearance mechanisms 4 offering another promising therapeutic interventiontargeting individual pro-inflammatory cytokines may not be sufficient to prevent covid-19 progression importantly spms terminate self-sustaining inflammatory processes such as those induced by covid-19 by broadly inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and promoting a return to tissue homeostasis 5 7 8 in contrast to some anti-inflammatory agents which may be contraindicated in covid-19 patients spms and sehis act at significantly lower doses and are not immunosuppressive 5 11 moreover conventional anti-inflammatory agents such as nsaids and cox-2 inhibitors while limiting the eicosanoid storm may be resolution toxic as they indiscriminately inhibit eicosanoid pathways that produce resolution mediators and thereby prevent active resolution 5 inhibiting resolution mediator production may potentially facilitate covid-19-induced tissue injury and progression of infection as demonstrated in many inflammatory disease models selectively promoting endogenous inflammation resolution mechanisms clears inflammatory exudates more effectively and promotes a return to tissue homeostasis compared with classic anti-inflammatory agents 511most covid-19 clinical trials focus on anti-viral and anti-inflammatory strategies in contrast stimulation of inflammation resolution is a novel host-focused alternative to complement current therapies the loss of active resolution mechanisms 5 and dysregulation of spms and eets in sustained pathological inflammation and lung diseases present a new opportunity for the management of covid-19 pro-resolving mediators as well as seh blockade may resolve the potentially fatal cytokine storm and severe pulmonary inflammation in covid-19 patients see fig 1 importantly both spms and eets have also been shown to attenuate pathologic thrombosis and promote clot removal which is now recognized as a key pathology of covid-19 infection 1214 spms including resolvins lipoxins and protectins as well as sehis are currently in clinical trials for other inflammatory diseases and could be rapidly translated for the management of covid-19 by complementing current anti-viral strategies via debris clearance and inflammatory cytokine suppression thus activating endogenous resolution pathways may be a novel therapeutic approach to limit severe organ damage and improve outcomes in covid-19 patientsthe ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respirat-ory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has caused over 92 million confirmed cases and 478000 deaths as of june 24th 2020 the high intensive care unit icu admission rate and mortality of covid-19 is continuously posing a serious strain on the global health-care system while most patients present with mild to moderate symptoms some patients may develop life-threatening sepsis respiratory failure acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple organ failure however current antiviral and supportive therapies are not sufficient to prevent or treat the above complications especially in severely ill covid-19 patients1 thus it is urgent to find the underlying mechanism dominating such life-threatening complications it is well recognized that lung damage and multi-organ failure in this subgroup of patients arise due to overwhelming systemic hyper-inflammation therefore promising anti-inflammatory candidate agents targeting diverse mechanisms related to cytokine storm will be therapeutically relevant fig 1
mounting evidence has demonstrated that severely ill covid-19 patients presented with elevated levels of cytokines and inflammatory indices such as serum il-1 il-6 il-10 and d-dimer than those with moderate symptoms suggesting the involvement of a cytokine storm2 cytokine storm represents an exaggerated immune response characterized by overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as ifn- tnf- il-6 il-1 il-18 cxcl8 and cxcl10 it has also been observed in other viral diseases such as influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers3 while an adequate release of cytokines is critical for the bodys defense against viral infection uncontrolled and aberrant immune system activation can lead to organ injury current clinical evidence also confirmed the correlation of cytokine storm syndrome and disease severity as well as unfavorable outcomes in hospitalized covid-19 patients3 the association of unfavorable prognosis with the presence of over-inflammation and cytokine storm highlights the necessity of early identification of cytokine storm and implementation of anti-inflammatory treatment timely control of hyper-inflammatory response is crucial to prevent the development and progression of irreversible ards and multi-organ dysfunction accompanying covid-19in covid-19 patients the most widely used anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory agents include corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin ivig corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone and dexamethasone were considered as one of the options for covid-19 patients with cytokine storm4 based on their inhibition on many inflammatory genes and previous clinical use in other viral diseases on 17th june preliminary results from a randomized controlled clinical trial were released by the recovery randomised evaluation of covid-19 therapy study group in the united kingdom this study showed that low-dose dexamethasone could reduce mortality by one-third in critically ill patients in need of mechanical ventilation5 however previous studies associate the use of corticosteroid in sars mers and influenza with a higher risk of a delayed viral clearance and long-term complications in survivors6 yet much remains unknown regarding the impact of corticosteroids on other clinical outcomes of covid-19 combination effect with other drugs time window and dosage of administration safety profile as well as possible adverse effects currently there are dozens of ongoing clinical trials addressing the unsolved questions supplemental table ivig is also used as an adjunctive drug in the treatment of severe covid-19 patients as a puried blood product from healthy donors it exerts immunomodulatory effect mainly through neutralizing virus by antibodiespolyclonal immunoglobulin g igg it could also block fc receptors which are involved in natural and adaptive immunity currently a limited number of clinical studies have shown that ivig treatment within 48 h of admission reduced the use of mechanical ventilation duration of icu stay and hospitalization as well as 28-day mortality7 however more clinical evidence for its effectiveness in managing clinical covid-19 infection is warranted ongoing clinical trials of ivig including those from convalescent patients are listed in supplemental tablenod-like receptor protein 3 nlrp3 inflammasome protein complex is crucial in hosts antiviral defense during viral replication the invading virus plus a variety of derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps and danger-associated molecular patterns damps can active nlrp3 inflammasome upon activation nlrp3 inflammasome induces pyroptosis as well as the secretion of il-1 and il-18 which are responsible for recruitment of neutrophils to the inammatory sites to assist in the virus eradication and induction of the adaptive immune system however a persistent activation of nlrp3 inflammasome excessive production of inammatory cells and cytokine as well as pyroptosis-mediated cell damage jointly lead to organ injury8 activation of inflammasome pathway is indicated by the elevation of il-1in severe covid-19 patients therefore drugs targeting at nlrp3 inflammasome and il-1 are promising in mitigating nlrp3-inflammasome driven hyper-inflammation pyroptosis and cytokine storm syndrome in severely ill covid-19 patients colchicine a bioactive alkaloid compound isolated from plant colchicum has been commonly used for inflammatory diseases such as gout it acts as an inhibitor of nlrp3 inflammasome and interferes with polymerization by binding to free tubulin dimers leading to the deregulation of inflammatory cell activities and release of cytokines especially il-69 in addition colchicine also suppresses the production of numerous cytokines pyrogens and superoxides mediated by white blood cells with regard to safety profile of colchicine 5-10 patients administered with therapeutic dose may exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms nausea vomit or diarrhea as side effects10 overall colchicine may be exploited as a potential candidate for alleviating the immune hyperactivity during sars-cov-2 infection recombinant il-1 receptor blocker such as anakinra and il-1monoclonal antibodies canakinumab are also of interest a prospective study showed that with a prospective cohort design showed that the treatment with anakinra contributes to a substantial reduction in mortality and use of invasive mechanical ventilation without bringing about serious side effects in critically ill covid-19 patients11 due to the anti-inflammatory effects of the above drugs their possible efficacy in covid-19 is gaining more and more attention currently there are a number of registered studies on clinicaltrials gov to test the effectiveness and safety of colchicine anakinra and canakinumab on covid-19 supplemental tablethe level of il-6 was significantly increased in covid-19 patients and was closely related to ards severity and outcome sars-cov-2 infection and subsequent release of virus particles recruits monocytes and macrophages leading to the release of cytokine and initiation of adaptive immune responses in this process il-6 played an essential role in most cases the immune response eliminates lung infection and the patients recovered however in others abnormal immune response triggered a cytokine storm which was characterized by persistent hypercytokinemia elevated il-6 tnf- il-1 eventually aggravated the lung injury and even had ripple effects through the entire body the immune dysregulation in severe covid-19 individuals was driven by il-612 and the il-6 deficiency was shown to reduce the severity in acute lung injury in mouse model13 therefore il-6 may be a potential target cytokine to treat covid-19 related ards il-6 inhibitors such as tocilizumab a recombinant humanized monoclonal il-6 blocking antibody could curb il-6 mediated pro-inflammatory pathway through binding to the soluble and membrane fraction il-6 receptor il-6r probably via the nuclear factor kappa-b and stat3 signaling pathway tocilizumab seemed to be effective in covid-19 patients which decreased the use of mechanical ventilation improved hypoxemia and ct opacity changes in some severe cases and clinical trials14 tocilizumab has been prescribed for treatment in severe patients with elevated il-6 level in china since march 2020 according to the diagnosis and treatment program for covid-19 national health commission of china 7th version most notably il-6 could either inhibit or accelerate viral replication and function in the lung suffering from infection or chemical insults thus the optimal timing for anti-il-6 administration will be essential therefore il-6 blockers could be an efficient therapeutic strategy for the treatment of covid-19 at present there are several registered studies under way to assess the safety and efficacy of il-6 blockers supplemental table

researches have indicated the potential role of brd4 inhibition in both antiviral response through dna damage manner to block the attachment of dna and rna16 as well as in alleviating the lung fibrosis one of the common sequelae of covid-19 in animal models and ex vivo experiments17 furthermore recent reports demonstrated the transmembrane e protein of sars-cov-2 resident on ergic and golgi membranes could bound to brd418 bet inhibitors like apabetalone rvx-208 and jq-1 inhibit vascular inflammation-related gene expression through suppressing bet-mediated transcription triggered by multiple pro-inflammatory stimuli by doing so bet inhibitors have many reported effects in inflammation airway remodeling cardiovascular disease and cancers19 though there is no reported cases of covid-19 who have been treated with brd4 inhibitors to date brd4 inhibitors could be considered as a potential candidate to ameliorate hyperinflammation and cytokine storm accompanying covid-19the pathophysiology of severe covid-1920 is related to aggressive inflammatory responses and damage to the lung and even ripple effects across the body thus the severity depends on the balance between the viral virulence and the host immune response when the infection occurs the release and recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps then trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines involving il-1 il-6 il-18 tnf- and macrophage inflammatory proteins normally a healthy immune response will clear the infection while an inadequate immune response will result in further accumulation of activated immune cells in the lungs leading to a cytokine storm and eventually damaging the lung or causing multiple organ failure through circulation therefore one strategy for the treatment against covid-19 is to block the overwhelming inflammation emerging evidence has suggested the potential effects of inflammation inhibitors on the treatment for covid-19 especially in severe cases further immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive therapies aimed at curbing immune mediated damage in covid-19 are ongoing supplemental table it is necessary to confirm the therapeutic effects investigate the administration timing and clarify the mechanism all of which may render it possible for immunoregulation interventions to arrest or reverse the devastating diseasenone declarednone declaredsince its first emergence in december 2019 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 a novel human coronavirus hcov has spread across the world at an alarming rate sars-cov-2 was named by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv based on the phylogenetic similarity to sars-cov 12 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the diseases caused by sars-cov-2 is far more extensive than the previous hcov-diseases with the number of confirmed patients worldwide has currently exceeded 40 million 3 4 5after the outbreak of covid-19 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 was promptly been identified as the functional receptor of sars-cov-2 2 ace2 is mainly distributed on the surface of well-differentiated airway epithelial cells especially ciliated cells and the respiratory tract has shown to be a predominant channel for hcov to invade the human body 6 sars-cov-2 can cause severe lower respiratory tract infection resulting in acute lung injury ali acute respiratory distressed syndrome ards and potentially death 7 a retrospective study of 1099 covid-19 patients from zhong nanshans group showed 911  of the patients developed pneumonia and 34  of the patients developed ards 8 while chen and colleagues reported that over 17  of the patients with covid-19 in wuhan developed ards 9 the fatality rate worldwide has currently reached 70  3 and respiratory failure has been considered to be the leading cause 695  of sars-cov-2 related death 10 to provide some implications for clinical therapy and drug exploration we reviewed covid-19 related clinical studies by searching the keywords sars-cov-2 covid-19 and 2019-ncov on sinomed pubmed embase who and medrxiv to explore the possible influencing factors behind covid-19 exacerbation and related biochemical indicatorsseveral clinical studies have shown that lymphopenia occurs frequently in covid-19 patients manifested as the decrease of total t cells cd4t cells and cd8t cells in the peripheral blood with the degree of decline related to the severity of the disease compared with patients with mild symptoms a higher proportion of severe or deceased patients had lymphopenia 10 11 12 13 14 which is similar to the observation during sars-cov infection 15 according to the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version 7 published by national health commission of china 16 an autopsy report of a patient who died from covid-19 indicated 1 the spleen atrophied significantly with apparent focal hemorrhage and necrosis 2 lymphocytes in the lymph nodes were depleted and necrotized and 3 the number of cd4t and cd8t cells in spleen and lymph nodes decreased significantly these pathological characteristics coincide with that of patients who died of sars-cov infection 17 furthermore compared with sars in 2003 severe covid-19 tends to have a higher viral load and a longer virus-shedding period 1819 since the rna sequence of sars-cov was found in the macrophages and aggregated t cells of lymph nodes 20 the direct impairment from sars-cov-2 may be an important cause of lymphopenia in patients with covid-19the severe damage in lymphoid organs by sars-cov-2 may relate to the ineffective control of the virus infection during the early stage which has been seen in sars-cov infection 21 type  interferon ifn including ifn- and ifn- plays a critical role in prohibiting viral infections and initiating adaptive immune responses including in sars-cov infection 2122 type  ifn can inhibit virus replication in vitro as well as in macaques and mice 23 24 25 26 however sars-cov may delay or evade innate immune response through early antagonism on ifn response in which ifn can only be detected after sars-cov reached a high titer 72728 present evidence implied that the viral load of sars-cov-2 peaks at the time of presentation even earlier than the time to peak of sars-cov 29 we suspected that similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 may escape from the immune response through the physical cover of double-membrane vesicles dmv and the chemical interference of the proteins encoded by itself 3031the clearance of the virus mainly depends on cellular immunity 32 innate antiviral signaling is initiated upon the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps by specific pattern recognition receptor prr molecules expressed on host cells 3334 this ultimately leads to the activation of transcriptional factors primarily interferon regulatory factor irf and nuclear factor-kappab nf-b for the induction of type  ifn and other proinflammatory mediators 3334 rig- like receptors rlr and toll-like receptors tlr are two types of prr that can recognize viral pamp 34 sars-cov encoded structural proteins such as n protein and m protein nonstructural proteins nsp and accessory proteins like orf3b and orf6 to antagonize the recognition and signal transduction 31 n protein inhibits inf- synthesis by inhibiting the activation of irf-3 and nf-kb 35 m protein prevents gene transcription of inf- by inhibiting the activation of irf-3irf-7 transcription factors 36 other proteins such as nsp1 nsp3 orf3b and orf6 et al can also antagonize ifn responses 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 recently a team from the university of chicago identified that the protein nsp15 from sars-cov-2 is 89  identical to the nsp15 found in sars-cov 44 since nsp15 acts as an endoribonuclease for the viruss double-stranded rna inhibition of nsp15 could slow viral replication 45 most recently kim et al reported sars-cov-2 can also express orf7a 3a 8 6 and 7b 46 indicating that targeting these proteins may help to recover the inhibition of sars-cov-2 infection at an early stagein addition to lymphopenia sars-cov-2 may also induce t cell exhaustion 47 expression of immune-checkpoint molecules such as programmed cell death 1 pd-1 and t cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 tim-3 accompanied by the elevation of anti-inflammatory cytokines is known to be the common indicators of t cell depletion 48 wangs team has observed that up-regulated pd-1 and tim-3 between covid-19 patients and healthy individuals and between prodromal stages and overtly symptomatic stages among covid-19 patients which was also associated with the increased levels of anti-inflammatory il-10 47 the expression of inhibitory immune receptors t-cell immunoglobulin and itim domain tigit and the cd94nk group 2 member a nkg2a on cd8  t cells were increased significantly in covid-19 patients 4950 however our current knowledge about t cell mainly cd8  t cell depletion gained from the research of tumors and chronic viral infection such as hiv and hbv it is generally believed that this phenomenon occurs when the body has been stimulated by antigens for a long period of time which is not in line with acute viral infection 4851 therefore it is not clear that t cell exhaustion is actually accruing in sars-cov-2 infectionsince sars-cov-2 can escape from the host immunity by inhibiting the production of type i ifn during the early stage of infection an artificial supplement of ifn- during the early stage of covid-19 infection may help to relieve injuries caused by the virus however we do not recommend applying glucocorticoids gss in the early stage as early use of immunosuppressive medications may exacerbate the viruss damage to the bodyalthough the direct damage from the viruses contributes to the initiation of the disease the cytokine storm caused by hcov plays a vital role in the development of ali and ard 7 cytokines are a group of small molecular proteins secreted by immune and tissue cells that includes interleukin il colony-stimulating factor gsf ifn tumor necrosis factor tnf growth factor gf and chemokines cytokines participate in immune responses through the activation of multiple signaling pathways such as jak-stat traf-nf-b traf-ap-1 and irak-nf-b 32 the term cytokine storm appeared for the first time in an article relating to graft-versus-host disease in 1993 52 as an interpretation for mechanisms of immune diseases or chronic inflammation gradually scientists found that viruses including cytomegalovirus streptococci influenza virus and sars-cov can also evoke cytokine storms 53 54 55 56 during viral infection prrs activate irf and nf-b pathways by recognizing pamp then promote the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from infected local epithelial cells or macrophages these cytokine-activated macrophages and virus-infected dendritic cells dc lead to a broader immune response attracting more inflammatory cells to inflammatory sites releasing a large number of cytokines which eventually results in a cytokine storm excessive cytokines may spill into the circulatory system and cause systemic cytokine storms resulting in multiple organ dysfunction 757previously it has been found that the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn-  il-1 il-6 il-12 and transforming growth factor- tgf- and chemokines ccl2 cxcl9 cxcl10 and il-8 in sars-cov infected patients were higher than those in healthy individuals while the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 in severe patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls 58 59 60 at the beginning of the epidemic huang et al reported that the plasma levels of il2 il7 gscf cxcl10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf- were higher in covid-19 patients in the intensive care unit icu than those of covid-19 patients outside the icu 61 furthermore the relatively higher level of serum ferritin was also seen in deceased patients comparing with discharged patients and in severe patients comparing with mild patients 6263 thus the pattern of cytokine storm in covid-19 patients was thought to be similar to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh 64 65 66 unlike the cytokines profile of sars patients covid-19 patients have a remarkable increase of anti-inflammatory cytokines il-10 table 1
 which has been often seen in hlh patients in previous studies 616768 compared with other increased cytokines increased il-10 was frequently associated with il-6 in patients with severe diseasetable 1 13694761 suggesting both il-10 and il-6 are the indicators of covid-19 exacerbationil-6 a kind of pleiotropic cytokine is expressed by immune cells such as dc monocytes macrophages b cells and subsets of activated t cells as well as by non-immune cells like fibroblasts epithelial cells and keratinocytes 74 75 76 77 it can activate jakstat raserkcebp and p3 kakt pathways through il-6r and signal-transducing coreceptor gp130 7879 il-6 also regulates b cell proliferation and differentiation and induces t cell differentiation 80 81 82 although il-6 has been proposed to be involved in the repair of lung injury in the mouse model of influenza a h1n1 virus 83 it contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory or autoimmunity diseases 8485 and excessive production of il-6 leads to serious disease progression in viral infection 8687il-10 is also a pleiotropic cytokine that limits and terminates inflammatory responses through inhibiting antigen-presenting cells apc pro-inflammatory cytokines production and t cell response 88 various subpopulations of cd4 helper t th cells including th1 th2 and th17 produce il-10 as an important self-regulatory function of th cells during infections 89 90 91 92 although reducing il-10 levels could improve the resistance to infection in some animal models the weakening control of inflammatory responses may cause significant damage to the hosts at the same time 93 thus il-10 plays a central role in maintaining a balance between damage and protectionil-6 induces nive t cells to differentiate into th2 cells and th17 cells and the activated th2 and th17 cells produce il-10 that regulates the immune response 94 95 96 97 98 fig 1
 the similarity in the signaling network between il-10 receptors and il-6r suggests the common biological process among il-10 and il-6 99 it has been reported that il-6 cooperated with il-10 to eliminate pathogens and modulate the cellular immune response in the patient infected with the h1n1 influenza virus but the produced immunosuppressive environment delayed virus clearance or increase secondary infection 86100 pathological findings of a deceased covid-19 patient showed elevated il-6 and il-10 with increased highly proinflammatory ccr4ccr6th17 in peripheral cd4t cells 101 rapid accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines stimulates the over-reaction of anti-inflammatory response resulting in severe immune injury in patients chinese diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version 7 suggests the increase of il-6 as an indicator for critical patients 16 we recommend measuring both il-10 and il-6 as the signs of the cytokine storm intensification in covid-19 patientsgreat attention has been paid to the cytokine storm in covid-19 infection to address the immediate need for reducing the rising mortality anti-inflammatory medications are commonly used for the management of cytokine storm which includes gcs intravenous immune globulin ivig and inflammatory cytokines antagonists such as il-1r antagonists il-6r antagonists and jak inhibitors however gcs may slow down the clearance of the coronavirus 102 high-dose ivig at the early stage of clinical deterioration was reported to be successful in three cases 103 and an ongoing randomized controlled trial rct of ivig in severe covid-19 patients nct04261426 may provide more authoritative evidence of this treatmentsince il-1 and il-6 are the major cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of shlh 65 the il-6r antagonist tocilizumab and sarilumab and il-1r antagonists anakinra may be effective choices a retrospective study of continuous intravenous infusion of anakinra in five patients established a rapid serologic and subsequent clinical improvement in adult patients with shlh 104 and a randomized placebo-controlled phase iii trial indicated that anakinra reduced mortality in sepsis patients with features of shlh 105 tocilizumab which attracts more attention compared with anakinra was found to improve fever hypoxemia lung lesions and crp levels in most of the severe covid-19 patients with no obvious adverse reactions in retrospective studies but several patients still aggravated 106107 serum level of il-6 after tocilizumab therapy tended to further spike initially and then decrease while the patients who failed treatment exhibited a persistent and dramatic increase of il-6 107108 nevertheless we cannot draw any firm conclusions on the efficacy and safety of anakinra or tocilizumab due to the limited sample size and retrospective method of the present evidence further studies are required to determine the probability of potential secondary infection and to find an appropriate biochemical indicator for monitoring the therapeutic effect clinical trials evaluating anakinra nct04341584 nct04324021 nct04339712 and nct04330638 and tocilizumab chictr2000029765 chictr2000030796 chictr2000030894 nct04317092 nct04335071 and nct04320615 et al in the treatment of covid-19 are ongoing across the worldsecondary bacterial infection has been found to further exacerbate viral pneumonia which is also related to the imbalance of t cells and plasma cytokines 109 bacterial coinfection is known to be associated with approximately 40  of viral respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization 110 early detection of bacterial infection and timely intervention will help to alleviate the deterioration of covid-19 procalcitonin pct released by bacterial infectious tissues under the irritation of pro-inflammatory cytokines is a more specific marker of serious bacterial infection compared to c-reactive protein crp and il-6 111 pct-based strategy has been applied to guide antibiotic use in icu or emergency wards since the serum pct levels in patients with severe bacterial infections are much higher than those with simple viral infections or non-specific inflammatory diseases 111 112 113 antimicrobial interventions are encouraged in patients with lower respiratory tract infection who has the value of pct  025 ngml or  05 ngml for they are likely or highly-likely respectively to undergo a bacterial infection 113114multiple studies have shown that pct levels increased in critical or deceased covid-19 patients table 2
 li et al 115 reported that 905  of deceased patients had elevated pct levels 01175 ngml including pct  025 ngml in 12 patients and pct  05 ngml in 9 patients and the pct value increased from the admission to death in another retrospective study of 1099 covid-19 patients higher proportions of pct  05 ngml were found in severe cases than mild cases 137  vs 37  8 patients who reached primary composite endpoint including admission to an icu the use of mechanical ventilation or death had a higher proportion of pct  05 ngml than patients without end-point events 240  vs 39  8 the correlation between increased pct and severe covid-19 was also observed in pediatric patients 116 these findings although preliminary suggested that bacterial infection may promote the aggravation of covid-19 timely measuring pct as a sign of secondary bacterial infection for the decision of antibacterial agents use is critical for covid-19 patients the aggravation of covid-19 ascribed to the secondary bacterial infection and the adverse events caused by unreasonable use of antibiotics could be reduced the most effective selection of the antibiotic agents should be based on bacterial culture in consideration of the dysregulation of the immune system in severe covid-19 patients antibiotic agents with immunomodulatory effects such as macrolides erythromycin and clarithromycin might be a better option previous studies have shown that in addition to antibacterial effects these drugs can also alleviate inflammatory reactions by reducing the accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and regulating neutrophil function and apoptosis 117 118 119 120the ongoing covid-19 pandemic is threatening the world with substantial mortality sars-cov-2 could cause lymphopenia and cytokine storm together with secondary bacterial infections adding to the deterioration of the disease in severe cases of covid-19 understandings of the dynamic process of sars-cov-2 infection would help to make an appropriate decision on treatment strategies we recommend measuring both il-10 and il-6 as a sign of intensification of cytokine storm in severe covid-19 cases though test il-10 is not routinely carried out in the clinic setting we also recommend using serum pct level to guild the initiation of antibacterial agents in patient with covid-19 although the selection of immunomodulators is challenging previous retrospective studies have revealed distinct immune regulators between the early and late stages of sars-cov-2 infection for instance supplementation of type  ifn instead of gcs at the early stage of infection may help to control the virus and relieve injury il-1r and il-6r antagonists could potentially be the effective choices for managing cytokine storm however these preliminary results would need to be validated from multiple ongoing rcts due to the rapid nature of covid-19 pandemic global collaboration in research and information sharing is ultimately needednonenovel coronavirus disease now known as covid-19 originated as viral pneumonia of unknown origin in the small province of wuhan china during december 2019 the causative agent was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by the international virus classification commission there have been two coronavirus mediated epidemic outbreak in the past two decades severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 within three months the spread of covid-19 to various countries of the world causing rapid rise in morbidity and mortality compelled the world health organisation who to declare it a pandemic on march 11 2020 as of may 27 2020 around 5488825 diagnosed cases of covid-19 with 349095 deaths have been reported source who covid-19 situation report 128 1 in india the total number of confirmed cases are 151767 with 4337 deaths till date 2during the last 4 months several studies on covid-19 have reported the clinical features laboratory findings and diagnostic evaluation of individuals suffering from this disease the mortality rate varies among various countries and depends on the patient clinical profile and presence of other comorbidities most of the patients with covid-19 suffer a mild course of disease manifesting clinical features of a viral pneumonia and gradually recover with supportive treatment but a proportion of them deteriorate to the severe form characterised by loss of respiratory function progressing to adult respiratory distress syndrome with occasional multiorgan failure 3 a vaccine to treat this disease is still under development and till then the only way to slow down the disease spread is by restricting the infectivity which is being tried by initiating social distancing and lockdown measures thus in the absence of any absolute cure it becomes essential to delineate the molecular mechanisms of this virus it is now known like sars and mers there is a considerable amount of immune dysregulation which may aid in the understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease the aim of this review is to summarize the inflammatory changes and immune dysregulation to outline the possible underlying immunological mechanisms of covid-19international virus classification commission has replaced the earlier name of novel coronavirus 2019 ncov-19 by sars like coronavirus 2 or simply sars-cov-2 it is a member of the coronaviridae family these viruses are enveloped positive sense single strand rna viruses genome size 3642 kb diameter 60140 nm having surface projections like a crown under the electron microscope this crown like appearance is the basis behind the name coronavirus so far four different genera of coronaviruses have been identified     among which two members of the -genera 229e and nl63 and two of the -genera hku1 and oc43 are known to cause mild respiratory illnesses in humans in the past 20 years two members of the -genera sars-cov and mers-cov have been responsible for the epidemic outbreaks of sars and mers respectively when people started being admitted in hospitals of wuhan china with features of fever fatigue and ards resembling pneumonia of unknown origin during december 2019 the viral genome sequencing of five such patients revealed the identity of a previously unknown - genera cov this novel coronavirus had 88 sequence similarity with two bat-derived sars-cov like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 and approximately 50 similarity with mers-cov 4like typical covs there are at least ten open reading frames orfs in the genome of sars-cov-2 orf1ab the first orf is about 75 of total viral rna and is translated into two large polyproteins these polyproteins are processed into a host of non-structural proteins nsps that constitutes the viral replicase transcriptase complex these nsps help in viral replication and transcription by rearranging the membranes originating from the rough endoplasmic reticulum into membranous vesicles the remaining orfs present in the other 25 genome encodes for spike s envelope e nucleocapsid n and membrane m proteins the four main structural proteins of the virus 5 6 they also encode for various accessory proteins that do not play a role in viral replication their functions have not been identified so farit has been established that the sars-cov-2 needs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor primarily located in lung and gastrointestinal epithelia to gain entry inside cells the strength of binding by the receptor binding motif or the s protein is a significant predictor of the pathogenesis of infection 7 earlier the sars-cov which most likely originated in bats had a similar requirement of ace2 receptors and gradually adapted to ace2 receptors of other species and eventually infected humans the changes in the s protein in sars-cov-2 in comparison to sars-cov and other marine and bat forms of coronaviruses clearly indicate several synonymous mutations and non-synonymous substitutions in the related gene 8 all these genomic changes have rendered the sars-cov-2 capable for the attachment to human cells the other member mers-cov can bind to a functional receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 of multiple species including humansa lot of studies on the clinical and laboratory characteristics of covid-19 have been published in the last four months mostly on chinese population recently studies based on populations from other countries like singapore united states european countries are also being reported the major clinical manifestations of patients with covid-19 includes fever dry cough sore throat muscle pain and fatigue which in some cases may progress to severe symptoms like acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring critical care in the form of intensive care unit icu admission and mechanical ventilationfrom the meta-analysis of 19 different studies the most common clinical manifestations among the 656 covid-19 patients were fever cough and dyspnoea among all the patients around 328 developed ards 203 patients required critical care and 62 developed shock fatal outcomes were observed in 139 patients old age  60 years was significantly associated with the severity of the disease 9 these findings were supported by another meta-analysis which included eight studies comprising of 46248 infected patients further hypertension diseases of respiratory and cardiovascular system were significant risk factors for severity of covid-19 10 smoking history and diabetes were also added to the list of comorbidities following the meta-analysis of emami et al in which the data of 76993 patients were systematically analysed 11 among the routine laboratory parameters alanine transaminase alt lactate dehydrogenase ldh d-dimer c-reactive protein ferritin were significantly elevated in severe cases of covid-19 in comparison to non-severe cases a significantly lower absolute number of lymphocytes cd4t and cd8t cells along with downregulation of ifn- expression in severe cases was also observed 12 in another pre-print xiang et al reported serum urea creatinine and cystatin c may be potential biomarkers in severity of covid-19 13 huang et al reported higher plasma levels of interleukins il-2 il-7 il-10 and other inflammatory markers gscf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf- in covid-19 patients requiring icu care versus non-icu patients 14cytokines and chemokines are critical mediators of the immune system and play a pivotal role in anti-viral immunity studies have demonstrated that the primary cause of ards and multi-organ failure in covid-19 to be associated with cytokine storm 15 the inflammatory response plays a major role in covid-19 pathogenesis while cytokine storm increases the severity of the disease cytokine storm cs is a phenomenon of excessive inflammatory reaction mediated by the rapid production of large amounts of cytokines in response to infection 16 in covid-19 there is an initial delay in cytokine and chemokine secretion by innate immune cells with subsequent surge in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines il-6 tnf-  il-8 mcp-1 il-1  ccl2 ccl5 and ifns by the activated macrophages and other recruited lymphocytes these cytokines induce the recruitment and activation of adaptive immune cells like t cells neutrophils and nk cells along with further production of pro-inflammatory cytokines thereby causing a cytokine storm and tissue damagemost studies have drawn a parallel between the immune dysregulation due to covid-19 and the phenomena seen in sars-cov and mers-cov 17 at the early stage of sars-cov and mers cov disease there is a delayed release of ifn-1 and ifn- primarily by dendritic cells macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells which is followed by increasing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as the disease progresses 18 the rapid surge in pro-inflammatory cytokines leads to inflammatory infiltration of lung tissue by neutrophils and monocytes and cause lung injury moreover increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulate t cell apoptosis and delay viral clearance 19 enhanced viral replication and heightened pro-inflammatory response injure the lung epithelial lining causing deterioration of the alveolar cellular barriers the endothelial cells are also damaged leading to changes in the microvasculature both of these injuries result in tissue hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 20 21 since the genome of the sars-cov-2 virus is related to sars-cov and mers-cov similar assumptions can be expected about the role of the host immune system towards this virus uncontrolled viral replication results in delayed anti-viral ifn response which in turn mounts an influx of neutrophils and macrophages at the site of injury with a concomitant surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines ie cytokine storm and thus leading to inflammatory injury to the respiratory system 22the cytokines elevated in the serum of covid-19 patients are il-1 il-2 il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 il-17 g-csf gm-csf ifn- tnf- ip10 mcp1 mip1a and mip1b in particular il-6 il-1 and tnf- ie cytokines secreted by macrophages were found to be significantly higher in severe cases when compared to non-severe cases 23 table 1il-6 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a primary role in cytokine storm and therefore needs special attention in covid-19 it is a multifunctional cytokine involved in the formation of follicular helper t cells differentiation of th17 cell subsets and generation of plasma cells it is also known to inhibit ifn- and thereby suppress cd8  cytotoxic t cells 24 il-6 induces t cell exhaustion as indicated by markers such as pd-1 and tim-3 thus t cell-mediated immune response might be suppressed during cytokine storm by il-6 25 increased il-6 levels and its positive correlation with disease severity is suggestive of its role in disease progression 2532 recently a study from germany reported a 22-fold increased risk of respiratory failure with median time to mechanical ventilation of 15 days in cases with il-6 levels  80 pgml 33 higher circulating levels of il-6 were also reported even 24-h before death 34 35 therefore il-6 either as a single parameter or in association with other parameters could be used for early identification of patients at risk for respiratory failuretnf- a pro-inflammatory cytokine acting via its receptor tnfr1 may lead to apoptosis of aged t cells that express high tnfr1 36 therefore it is also known as a pro-apoptotic cytokine few studies on covid-19 patients reported a negative correlation of tnf- with t cell count 12 23 37 tnf- levels were significantly higher in elderly patients  60 years along with reduced t cell counts and increased levels of t cell exhaustion markers pd1 and tim-3 this finding speculates the role of tnf- as a negative regulator of t cell survival or proliferation 25 however a few studies reported no significant difference in tnf- levels in covid-19 patients 38 39il-1 and its family il-18 il-33 are significant players in ards and are known to increase the recruitment of immune cells and subsequent cytokine production 40 il-1 receptor signalling is involved in inflammatory damage to the respiratory epithelium in a study the daily transcriptomic profiling of three covid-19 patients revealed il-1 to show significant expression changes prior to deterioration of respiratory function all the other pro-inflammatory cytokines were induced only after appearance of symptoms of respiratory dysfunction this brief report hints at the plausible role of the il-1 pathway in the initial progression of covid-19 related lung immunopathology 41 il-1 and tnf- are cytokines that are required for the development of th17 cells and help in th17 mediated immune response and increased vascular permeability 40 the cytokines of the th17 pathway like il-17 and gm-csf increase in covid-19 patients 42 also increased expression of th17 cells in peripheral blood of covid-19 patients suggests a role for th17 cells in the cytokine storm in covid-19 as also reported in the patients of sars and mers 43significantly elevated levels of il-2 il-7 il-17 il-10 mcp- 1 mip-1a and tnf- were reported in severely ill patients in comparison to non-severely ill patients suggestive of diverse cytokine profile in the two groups and involvement of cytokine storm in disease progression and severity 23 an increased concentration of il-1 ip-10 ifn- and mcp-1 leads to the activation of th1 cell response which further aggravates the cytokine storm a similar rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines occurred in sars-cov and mers-cov infection 44 45 contrary to sars an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines of th2 cells il-4 and il-10 were also seen in sars-cov-2 patients 46 the implications of this finding are still yet to be clarifiedhigh serum cytokine levels in sars-cov-2 patients correlated with decreased t cell count in the peripheral blood suggesting a plausible role in disease progression diao et al reviewed total t cell count and il-2 il-4 il-6 il-10 tnf- and ifn- in 522 covid-19 patients admitted to two different hospitals in china and 40 healthy individuals and reported significantly higher levels of il-6 il-10 and tnf- correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between total cell count cd4   and cd8  cells and these interleukins further in the ten follow up patients il-6 il-10 tnf- and ifn- levels were significantly decreased in the recovery period than during the illness at the same time the t cell counts recovered to normal levels thereby suggesting that the decline in t cell is again associated with the surge of inflammatory cytokines in covid-19 patients 25 a similar negative correlation between t cell counts and interleukins was also reported in other studies 27 37 on the contrary wan et al who observed the associations of lymphocyte subsets cytokines with disease evolution in 123 chinese covid-19 patients 102 mild and 21 severe reported significantly different cd4  t cd8  t il-6 il-10 and pii between the two groups in the mild group significant positive correlations were observed between cd4  t and cd8  t and between il-6 and il-10 patients of mild group and with il-6 within reference range had higher survival rates but there was no correlation between cell count and interleukins 26a recent study attempted to immunophenotype the anti-viral response in covid-19 patients by single-cell transcriptome sequencing using pbmcs of 4 patients male young male elderly female young female elderly collected pre-icu during icu and post icu there was a significant increase in monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cell populations in the icu samples when compared to pre and post icu samples 47 therefore there is evidence of delayed or dampened type 1 interferon response in the initial stages of the infection with subsequent increase with active viral replication a phenomenon also to be a part of sars-cov pathogenesis 19 22 a reported gene signature in the icu samples showed elevated expression of interferon-stimulated genes isgs like ifitm1 when compared to pre and post icu samples suggestive of a critical viral load regulated type 1 interferon response type-1 ifn response in the disease progression and onset of ards 47covid-19 induced ards and mortality may be mediated by many factors alteration of both innate and adaptive components of the immune system in terms of dampened t cell response neutrophilia and delayed type-1 ifn response plays a significant role additionally increased expression of granulysin and perforin increase in macrophage activated cytokines like il-1 il-6 and tnf- leading to cytokine storm and increased t cell exhaustion might further contribute to the molecular pathogenesis approximately 15 of patients suffering from covid-19 progress to critically ill severe cases with the clinical symptoms of respiratory failure requiring ventilator support a cytokine storm accompanies the transition from mild to severe form of the disease in covid-19 patientsan efficient synergy between innate and adaptive lineages of immune system is a preliminary requirement for effective disposal of invading pathogens cells of innate immunity monocyte macrophage granulocytes and dendritic cells are the first to act whenever there is an invasion by foreign molecules the main function of innate immunity includes opsonization and direct clearance by complement activation in addition to elimination via phagocytosis however another important function is also to process and appropriately present the invading pathogen in order to activate the cells of adaptive immune system responses from adaptive immune cells not only aim to eradicate the pathogen but also reserves a memory of it for future protection in addition adaptive immunity also plays a crucial role in regulating the extent of immune response to prevent overstimulation and host injury our understanding of sars and mers though still limited have shown us that disease pathogenesis included host immune dysregulation along with direct damage caused by the viruses 22 understanding the dysregulation of innate and adaptive immunity cell subsets may thus provide substantial insight into the immunopathogenesis of sars-cov-2while the major mode of transmission of sars-cov-2 is primarily aerosolized droplets there is a possibility that a faeco-oral route also exists 48 initial symptoms of the disease include fever dry cough and rarely dyspnoea body ache headache and diarrhoea viral load is said to reach its peak 10 days post onset of symptom 49 studies assessing the clinical features of covid-19 patients have reported that the mean time for admission after onset of symptoms was 7 days iqr 48 while ards typically set in on 9th day iqr 814 27 admission in intensive care unit andor requirement of mechanical ventilation was seen in 16 cases with a mean time of 105 days iqr 817 3 sars-cov-2 is known to infect cells via the surface receptors ace2 and tmprss2 50 the cells are then known to undergo viral replication induced pyroptosis leading to release of il-1 and damage associated molecular patterns damps and pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps such as atp viral nucleic acid and asc oligomers these molecules induce the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as il-6 il-10 macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein-1 mip-1 macrophage inflammatory protein-1 mip-1 from the adjacent epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages the resultant microenvironment therefore attracts cells of both innate and adaptive immunity and pro-inflammatory cascade sets in 23 45 in the case of mild form of the disease the infected cells and viral particles are rapidly cleared away by macrophages or neutralized by antibodies without any resulting damage to the airways from the host response however in some cases the disease progression has been seen to take a turn for the worse and is characterized by excessive cellular infiltration and a systemic cytokine storm 23 51 clinically this can be diagnosed as ards which is known to be the major cause of fatality in severe covid-19 cases 35 while age and co-morbidities have been identified to be associated with covid-19 induced severe respiratory distress syndrome underlying mechanisms responsible for the cytokine storm and immune dysregulation in uncontrolled disease are yet to be identified il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf were also higher in patients requiring icu that non-icu patients suggesting a possible different cytokine profile in severe and mild cases 23lung macrophages are therefore among the primary players in both effective host immunity against sars-cov-2 and in uncontrolled immunopathology of covid-19 studies which investigated the monocyte macrophage lineage in covid-19 patients have concluded that these cell lineages contribute to the cytokine storm by secretion of mcp-1 ip-10 and mip-1 49 single cell rna-sequencing based characterization of broncho alveolar lavage fluid balf from three severely ill three mild covid-19 patients and eight healthy controls have revealed that a monocyte derived fcn-1 macrophages were the predominant macrophage in the balf 52 these macrophages are known to be highly inflammatory and capable of producing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and are also known to be involved in cytokine storm 52 analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell pbmc subsets in covid-19 patients have also shown an elevated level of cd14 and cd16 monocyte subset when compared to healthy controls the level of this highly inflammatory monocyte subset was also seen to be higher in covid-19 cases requiring intensive care 51 these monocytes also showed higher expression of il-6 and gm-csf thus suggesting a pivotal role in the advent of cytokine storm 51 hla-dr expression on cd14 monocytes of covid-19 patients were found to be significantly low among severe cases when compared to mild cases the levels of which improved on treatment with il-6 inhibitor toclizumab 53 higher levels of ccl-2 monocyte chemotactic factor was also seen in blood of covid-19 patients along with increased transcription of its receptor ccr-2 54early studies from wuhan china reported normal total leukocyte count with an imbalance between neutrophil and lymphocyte proportions in covid-19 cases 26 29 55 wu et al studied the immune profile of 201 covid-19 cases and reported significantly high neutrophil counts there was also a significant reduction in total lymphocyte count resulting in skewed neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio nlr 29 neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia were common findings presented by several authors and these findings were more significant among severe cases when compared to mild cases or healthy controls 23 27 28 34 56 pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines il-6 tnf mcp-1 released in response to local inflammation of infected lung epithelial cells and macrophages attract leukocytes and macrophages but not neutrophils to the site of inflammation this could explain the observed peripheral lymphopenia and neutrophilia proportion of other granulocytes such as monocytes basophils and eosinophils were observed to be low or within normal limits 55 57 58cells of the adaptive immune system are activated in response to antigen presentation and cytokine released by macrophages and dendritic cells on viral invasion a moderate decrease in b and nk cells with a significant decrease in total t cell count have been observed in covid-19 cases 26 28 37 51 55 5961 table 2 a retrospective study involving 452 covid- 19 patients reported significantly lower levels of t cells b cells nk cells and cd4 t helper cell subset showed the most significant reduction in severe cases when compared mild cases immuno-suppressive treg cells were also reported to be significantly lower among the cases showing severe disease progression the authors have thus reported that the t lymphocyte subset might be especially vulnerable to dysregulation in covid-19 55 higher viral load was also reported to be associated with severe disease spectrum 62 another study on 16 covid-19 patients attempted to differentiate between severe and mild cases with respect to activation function and exhaustion of cd4 and cd8 t cells along with other lymphocyte populations in peripheral blood of 10 mild and 6 severe cases the authors reported significant decrease in function of cd4 t increased activation of cd8 t cells which subsequently might lead to exhaustion of cd8 and reduced cellular immune response to covid-19 63 existing t cells were found to be in hyperactivated state as indicated by cd69 cd38 and cd44 expression in addition to ox40 and 41bb expression by cd4 and cd8 t cells respectively 51 ox40 and 41bb are tumor necrosis factor receptors tnfr implicated in t cell mediated cytokine production and stimulation of other t cells in addition to functional t cell markers exhaustion markers ie tim-3 and pd-1 co-expression were also found to be significantly expressed in severe cases 25 63 64 in contrary to adult cases a study on 8 paediatric patients showed an increase in cd4 and cd8 cells with a decrease in nk cells 65 in general paediatric patients showed better prognosis than adult patients which could be due to lower concentration of memory t cells to mount a cytotoxic response potent enough to cause tissue damageth follicular cells tfh are required for activation differentiation of b cells and are thus important for antibody mediated viral clearance tfh count was reported to be elevated in mild and recovering covid-19 patients when compared to healthy controls 66 67 a case study on a patient with non-severe covid-19 revealed an increase in circulating tfh at the same time of viral load decreasing to below lower limit of detection ct value  45 recruitment to peripheral circulation of immune cells including tfh seemed to herald the resolution of symptoms in this case 66 interestingly authors of another article which is in pre-print stage have reported increased cd8 t cell exhaustion assessed by expression of pd-1 and increased tfh cells in the peripheral blood of 38 non-severe covid-19 patients compared to healthy controls 67among the cytokines seen to be elevated in covid-19 some are th17 pathway specific such as il-17 il-1 tnf and gm-csf 42 these findings have prompted various authors to investigate the role of th17 in sars-cov-2 induced severe covid-19 cases a case study on a patient with severe covid-19 reported an elevated count of th17 cells activated cd8 and cd4 t cells 68 another study reported a decrease in th17 subset as indicated by low il-17 secretion 53 thus further studies are required to delineate the role of th17 specific response in covid-19a recent review suggested that major host immune dysregulations include dampened type-1 ifn response viral load induced hyperinflammation and recruitment of proinflammatory cells like neutrophils and monocytes 22 type-1 ifn response is crucial for induction of effective adaptive response and controlling viral replication a study conducted for immunophenotyping the antiviral response in covid-19 patients used pbmcs of 4 patients male young male elderly female young female elderly collected pre-icu during icu and post icu as per the finding by single cell transcriptome sequencing the authors have reported a significant increase in monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cell pdc populations in the icu samples 53 the authors have also reported a gene signature in the icu samples which showed elevated expression of ddx58 irf8 tlr7 and interferon stimulated genes isgs like ifitm1 when compared to per and post icu samples there is therefore evidence of delayed or dampened type-1 ifn response in the initial stages of the infection with subsequent increase with active viral replication a phenomenon also reported to be part of the pathogenesis of sars-cov 22 43 in a subsequent study involving profiling of immune cells whole blood transcriptome and cytokine levels in 50 covid-19 patients of varying severity authors reported a significant impaired type-1 ifn response in the critical patients this impaired type-1 ifn response characterized by reduced levels of ifn- and ifn- along with high il-6 and tnf- levels the study also revealed a significant downregulation of 6 isgs which specify type-1 ifn response in the severe covid-19 cases pdc population was also reduced in patients in comparison to healthy controls 54in the present scenario where every other day newer and broader clinical aspects of covid-19 are being searched focus also needs to be diverted towards one important issue ie why there is so much diversity in the response elicited towards the same disease by different individuals sars cov-2 is a novel corona virus despite this fact some patients developed a wide range of symptoms with severe abnormalities on the other hand some are completely asymptomaticmorbidity and mortality from diseases have a direct link with an individuals response to the disease 69 host genetic variation plays an important role in the varied immune response which in turn results in different disease outcome between individuals polymeric genes of host and their regulatory network influence immune responses to foreign compounds there is correlation between underlying genetic traits and phenotypes displayed 70 the host genetic variation impacts virus induced immune responses by individuals 71variability across human genes involved in antigen presentation to t lymphocytes is the major factor determining susceptibility or resistance to a wide range of infections human leukocyte antigen hla major histocompatibility complex mhc are molecules shown to regulate varied level of viral susceptibility and differential response the mhc gene family is comprised of 3 main subfamilies class i ii and iii genes located in proximity on chromosome 6 hla- abc belonging to mhc class-i and hla-dp dm do dq and dr belonging to mhc class ii mediate antigen presentation to t cells hla of class i and ii reside on cell membranes of all nucleated cells and antigen presenting cells respectively mhc-i and ii both have extracellular domains that form the peptide binding groove where antigenic peptide derived from different sources bind the bound antigens based on their source intracellular endogenous or extracellular exogenous are presented either to cd8 or to cd4 cells by mhc-i or mhc-ii respectively 72hla has already been studied as a major component of immune system responsible for varied immune response to pathogens hla genotype plays an important role in differential regulation and activation of t cells as well as disease transmission and duration 73 studies reported an increased severity towards the closely related sars-cov diseases in individuals with hla-b4601 genotype similarly response to disease caused by other unrelated viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus 1 hiv-1 dengue virus is also linked with respective hla genotype of the host in case of hiv hla-a0205 reduces the risk of seroconversion 74 while in dengue hla alleles hla-a0207 hla-b51 were associated with susceptibility towards severe secondary disease among native thais 75studies have also investigated human genotype to determine putative hla alleles and their affinity towards novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 nguyen et al performed an in-silico analysis to check the binding affinity of viral peptide-mhc class i across 145 different hla types of the total alleles studied hla-a0202 b1503 c1203 were the most efficient conserved peptide presenters while hla-a2501 b4601 c0102 were shown to have very fewer binding peptides for sars-cov-2 in addition there were 56 other different hla alleles in humans which did not show any appreciable binding affinity all the three major class i genes exhibit similarity in peptide presentation across entire virus sars-cov-2 proteome and are independent of stage early or late of peptide and its production time 73 hla-b4601 allele was found to have the least predicted binding sites for sars-cov-2 and therefore individuals with this allele have less active immune response and thus more vulnerable to infection similar findings were reported in case of sars-cov infectionsa difference in hla haplotype may influence the individuals response to sars-cov-2 infection and certain haplotypes may be associated with increased disease severity thus hla genotyping may assist in identifying individuals at risk therefore hla testing is highly recommended along with covid-19 testing to enhance the sensitivity and to predict susceptibility to disease severity it is a rapid and reliable method that will assist in planning future vaccination strategyhuman infections with coronavirus such as sars and mers have occurred in the past however the present infection with sars-cov-2 has evolved to become a pandemic in contrast to the rest sars-cov-2 has shown to have similarities with its predecessors ie sars-cov and mers-cov in terms of genome sequence receptor affinity pathogenesis and disease presentation however our knowledge of mers or sars has not been enough to curb current covid-19 pandemic hence mandating the need to expand our knowledge on sars-cov-2 only a small proportion of the infected patients progress to severe stage needing critical care thus in absence of proper cure it becomes essential to delineate the factors that may aid in the severity assessment of the disease if individuals at risk of developing severe symptoms can be identified early management of the disease may improve to a significant extentin this review we have attempted to brief the virology and associated pathogenesis particularly in aspects of immunopathology invasion of lung epithelial cells and probably certain immune cells directly by sars-cov-2 via infectious aerosolized droplets heralds the infection peripheral neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia associated with delayed but exaggerated immune response mediate the fatal ards multi-organ dysfunction resulting in death of covid-19 patients while male gender increasing age and co-morbidities have shown to be risk factors for severe disease il-6 and tnf- were found to be potential markers of disease severity il-1 mediated pyroptosis and tissue injury can be hypothesised to be a major molecular mechanism underlying pathogenesis of covid-19 23 cytokine storm a phenomenon long studied in sepsis associated conditions has no successful effective management so far 76 future studies in different population groups should be designed with an aim to identify molecular targets that may help in early diagnosis and predicting severity of patients with covid-19 moreover alternative treatment modalities like drug repurposing using interleukin inhibitors plasma therapy is also another area that needs exploration 77 thus until a vaccine is available the main stay of treatment in covid-19 cases will continue to be supportive care while use of monoclonal antibodies mesenchymal stem cells and plasma of recovered patients are still in experimental stage being precautious and restricting movement is the only successful solution for reducing further spreadas of may 14 2020 the world health organization has reported 4248386 cases of covid-19 with 294046 reported deaths secondary to complications related to the novel coronavirus1 in the united states the center for disease control cdc reported 1364061 total cases and 82246 covid-19 related deaths2 a common complication reported secondary to covid-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome ards requiring endotracheal intubation and ventilator management experts currently believe that ards possibly results from a state of hyper-inflammation mediated by a cytokine storm in covid-19 patients3 recipients of solid organ transplants are included in a special population of patients who may face increased risks of covid-19 related complications given their use of chronic immunosuppressants immunosuppression in this population can further reduce cell-mediated immunity which may prolong viral shedding and increase the risk of covid related complications3 as reported by mcgonagle et al interleukin-6 il-6 plays an important role in lung repair following viral insults and the administration of il-6 inhibitor drugs may be time-sensitive3 we report a case of covid-19 in a patient with kidney and liver transplant and discuss the use of il-6 inhibitor to prevent a cytokine storm in this settingthe patient is a 63-year-old male kidney and liver transplant recipient who presented to the emergency department ed after developing symptoms of mild fever shortness of breath and cough his vitals and physical exam in the emergency department were within normal limits except for a temperature of 38 degrees celsius his initial chest x-ray on the day of admission day 1 was unremarkable he tested negative for influenza and covid-19 via polymerase chain reaction pcr and was admitted to the hospital at the time of admission he had a normal white blood cell count 694  109liter decreased absolute lymphocyte count 29 and normal liver function tests cytomegalovirus and bordetella pcr serology were also negative his home immunosuppressant regimen consisted of mycophenolic acid 500 milligrams daily prednisone 5 milligrams daily tacrolimus 2 milligrams twice a dayon day 2 of the admission the patient was switched from oral prednisone to methylprednisolone 40 milligrams administered every eight hours intravenously on day 3 he received cefepime 1 gram over six hours he also received five doses of hydroxychloroquine 400 milligrams on days 3-7on day 4 the fever subsided and vitals remained within normal limits however he developed increasing shortness of breath with new diffuse expiratory wheezes on physical exam

5 as of may 14 2020 the world health organization has reported 4248386 cases of covid-19 with 294046 reported deaths secondary to complications related to the novel coronavirus 1 while this lethal disease has not spared immunocompetent patients populations who have the highest mortality risk require special attention at this time there are limited case reports on solid organ transplant sot patients6 there is insufficient data on the clinical presentation and management of immunosuppressant regimens in sot recipients4 these patients may differ from the immunocompetent population in regards to presentation diagnosis and clinical course of covid-194 notably transplant patients may present with mild or atypical symptoms and without fever thus physicians must maintain broad differential diagnoses and high clinical suspicions7 one case series of five patients reported the most common symptoms on admission were fever cough myalgiafatigue and sputum production5 other case reports have identified patients as having vague abdominal discomfort4
table 2
outlines the reported cases on covid-19 in sot recipients we did not find any reports of patients with double solid organ transplants reported in the literaturerecent proposals regarding the pathophysiology of covid-19 suggest a hyper-inflammatory state resulting in covid-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 3 once infected there is loss of primary antiviral defense because of virus-induced interferon suppression with lymphopenia 8 subsequently the body activates a second defense mechanism known as the second wave which results in a cytokine storm and severe tissue damage 3 increases in many inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr c-reactive protein crp serum ferritin interleukins 6 8 and 10 procalcitonin and interleukin-receptor have been found in covid-19 patients 9interleukin-6 il-6 is a marker of recent interest because of its role in the second wave and resulting cytokine storm10
il-6 signal transduction occurs via three main pathways classical signal transduction trans signal transduction and trans presentation 11 the classical signal transduction involves il-6 binding to the il-6r and forming a complex the il6-il6r complex then binds to membrane gp130 and subsequently initiates intracellular transduction 11 the trans signal transduction pathway occurs with il-6 binding to sil-6r and forming a complex the il6-sil6r complex then binds to membrane gp130 which then initiates intracellular signal transduction 11 the trans presentation signal involves sgp130 forming a complex with sil-6r to prevent sil-6r from binding to membrane-bound gp130 the jak-stata ras-raf and atk-pi3k pathways are then activated 11chen et al found in a sample of 48 patients that increased levels of il-6 significantly correlated to disease severity 12 another study reported a significant association between lymphopenia and increased il-6 levels in covid-19 non-survivors compared with survivors 12

13 these findings suggest monitoring il-6 levels to evaluate cytokine storm as a prognostic tool 12 however it is likely that physicians do not routinely follow il-6 levels in covid-19 patients with solid organ transplants as it was not a commonly reported lab value in the studies we evaluated table 2treatment with tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody that binds to the il-6 receptor has been recently published11 by binding to the il-6r tocilizumab can inhibit both the classical and trans signaling pathways leading to a reduction in the second wave response and preventing cytokine storm 11the standard treatment dosing according to the diagnosis and treatment protocol for covid-19 7th edition is a first dose of 4-8 mgkgday with 400 mg diluted to 100 ml with 09 normal saline infused over a 1 hour period 14 the maximal dose is 800 mg and the maximal number of administrations is two 14 this dosing is based on a small trial of 21 patients that received tocilizumab in addition to the standard care recommended by the diagnosis and treatment protocol for covid-19 6th edition including lopinavir methylprednisolone other symptom relievers and oxygen therapy 15 given the small sample size we need more research on appropriate dosing at this time there is a multicenter randomized controlled trial currently ongoing in china 16 another potential medication that decreases il-6 levels is metronidazole 13 in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that metronidazole decreases serum il-6 levels 13
close monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy in sot recipients infected with covid-19 is necessary there is a balance of allowing adequate immune response to suppress viral load and preventing transplant rejection previous case reports have hypothesized that immunosuppressive therapy protects sot recipients by dampening the cytokine storm 17 other case reports have noted that viral rna levels remain positive for a longer period than in immunocompetent patients 4 this is notable because previous studies have demonstrated that ards occurs in sars patients despite a decreased viral load 18 this is important because it indicates antiviral therapy alone is inadequate treatment and supports the hypothesis that the ards results from the cytokine storm 18 one case report of a liver transplant recipient that tested positive for covid-19 suffered from acute transplant rejection despite maintaining adequate immunosuppression based on lymphocyte subtests 4 this suggests that early il-6 intervention to prevent the cytokine storm could improve outcomes in covid-19 positive sot recipientsone of the main concerns with il-6 blockade in the treatment of covid-19 however is the appropriate timing of when to start treatment it is possible that blocking il-6 signal transduction can lead to a reduction in viral clearance 3 in patients that are already immunosuppressed this could lead to a much higher viral load as compared with immunocompetent patients additionally we do not know whether il-6 alters the levels of circulating tacrolimus this may suggest cessation of immunosuppressive therapy until the initial cytokine storm as resolved temporary removal of immunosuppressive regiment is likely beneficial for transplant recipients because clinical outcomes of covid-19 seems to mostly dependent on the virus-host interactionanother interesting finding in many patients with covid-19 is the potential for a second cytokine storm a second cytokine storm may have happened to the patient in this case report as he clinically improved and then developed a recurrence of respiratory distress that required the intubation the il-6 levels were also markedly elevated at this time suggesting an ongoing cytokine response this may be the reason why several of these patients become severely hypoxic after a few days of stabilization this may also suggest that we administer the tocilizumab in an interval fashion approximately 4-6 days after the first administrationin conclusion there is limited data on the clinical presentation management and appropriate treatment of covid-19 patients who are recipients of solid organ transplants the use of il-6 inhibitor in our patient resulted in clinical improvement initially but it is difficult to determine if the tocilizumab played a role in the management of this patient specifically in preventing respiratory failure the cytokine storm appears to play a major role in these patients and it is possible that several of them experience a second storm that results in severe respiratory distress and intubation thromboembolic phenomena also appear to play a role in respiratory failure a single case does not represent the complex strategy needed when considering the treatment of covid-19 patients with solid organ transplants further studies are necessary to investigate treatment modalities for covid-19 in special populationssevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 has infected over 4 million people worldwide resulting in a pandemic responsible for over 278000 deaths as of may 11 2020 12 the severity of coronavirus disease of 2019 covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic infection to critical illness with up to one third of hospitalized patients requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit icu 3 4 5 6 fatality rates vary between demographic groups with old age and certain comorbidities hypertension obesity diabetes associated with higher riskin a subset of patients with severe covid-19 rapid progression of pulmonary infiltrates and multi-organ failure coincides with dramatic increases in inflammatory cytokines and other biochemical markers of inflammation consistent with a covid-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome covid-css 7 8 9 10 11 the high mortality rate associated with covid-css has led to the off-label use of targeted anti-cytokine therapies aimed at blocking the inflammatory cascade and improving patient outcomes clinical trials are being conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of cytokine blockade in covid-19 currently there are no standard therapies for covid-19 or covid-css and recent national institutes of health nih guidelines have recommended against use of investigational agents outside of clinical trials 12 on may 1 2020 the united states food and drug administration fda have granted emergency use authorization for the anti-viral drug remdesivir based on the as-yet unpublished results of a national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid sponsored randomized control trial that demonstrated reduced recovery time compared to placebo 13 how this drug my influence cytokine storm and how the niaid trial compares to a prior study that found no benefit of the drug are currently not known 14covid-css has brought renewed attention to cytokine storm syndrome as a general concept 15 in 1993 perhaps influenced by the military operation desert storm the term cytokine storm was coined to describe the hypercytokinemia seen in graft-versus-host disease gvhd 1617 css has since been associated with viral infections eg influenza severe acute respiratory syndromesars autoimmune diseases eg systemic lupus erythematosussle systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritisjia hematologic conditions hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosishlh and medications 18 19 20 examples of the latter include the phase i clinical trial of tgn1412 an anti-cd28 monoclonal antibody that caused severe cytokine storm in healthy volunteers and the cytokine release syndrome crs following chimeric antigen receptor car-t cell therapy 2122 the wide heterogeneity of conditions that have been placed under this umbrella term underscore the need to better understand the pathophysiology and treatment of diseases characterized by hypercytokinemia recently css has been defined as a condition of dysregulation and perpetuated activation of lymphocytes and macrophages resulting in secretion of large quantities of cytokines leading to overwhelming systemic inflammation and multi-organ failure with high mortality 20understanding the hypercytokinemia and immune dysregulation associated with covid-19 is urgent some have proposed that covid-19 is actually a hypo-inflammatory vasculopathy rather than a cytokine storm this hypothesis is based on one study reporting relatively low interleukin-6 il-6 levels mean 25 pgml normal range  7 measured on admission to hospital in one chinese study 23 however cytokine storm is generally thought to develop later in the course of this disease and emerging data from our center and others indicates that patients with covid-css have a degree of hypercytokinemia ie il-6 levels 100 to 5000 pgml comparable to conditions such as car-t cell crs the overlap in clinical and biochemical features between covid-css and cytokine storm syndromes associated with other conditions may allow for insight into the underlying pathologic immune dysregulation in covid-css and inform strategies for therapeutic intervention in this review we summarize the clinical features pathologic mechanisms standard and investigational therapies for css in three well-defined hematological cytokine storm syndromes secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh idiopathic multicentic

242627 the hlh-2004 criteria may be restrictive in identifying all patients that may benefit from immunomodulation the hscore was developed specifically for secondary and especially malignancy associated hlh in adults but unfortunately does not include any cytokine-related criteria 28 initially named for the hemophagocytosis seen on tissue biopsy hemophagocytosis in bone marrow aspirate is a common but non-specific feature in adults 2930 clinical and laboratory features include fevers often described as hectic in that they may exceed 40 c organomegaly cytopenias coagulopathy and profound hyperferritinemia often 10000 gl which often rapidly worsen despite initial empiric anti-microbial therapy resulting in eventual multisystem organ failure 2431 mortality remains high in adults around 70 despite therapy though patients with mas-hlh driven by rheumatologic diseases have better prognosis with less aggressive immunosuppression than other secondary hlh syndromes 2429castleman disease cd describes a group of syndromes with shared clinical hyperinflammation and histopathological features 32 diagnosis requires lymph node biopsy with characteristic histopathology as defined by consensus guidelines residing on a spectrum of histologic patterns from regressed germinal centers and prominent vascularization to hyperplastic germinal centers with prominent plasmacytosis 3233 idiopathic mcd is characterized by dysregulation of il-6 mediated inflammation typically occurring in the 5th and 6th decade of life patients present with lymphadenopathy in more than one lymph node station constitutional symptoms fluid accumulation and cytopenias 3233 liver or kidney dysfunction as well as the presence of secondary autoimmune phenomenon are also common 3234 the profound inflammation of the disease is reflected by a frequently observed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia in the imcd-not otherwise specified imcd-nos subgroup 35 a subset of patients demonstrate a more aggressive clinical course with thrombocytopenia ascites reticulin fibrosis renal dysfunction and organomegaly tafro and do not exhibit the same hypergammaglobulinemia seen with imcd-nos 3235the engineering of car t-cells to bind tumour-specific epitopes and elicit cell-mediated death of malignant cells has been a major leap forward in cancer therapy first implemented in relapsed and refractory b-cell lymphoid malignancies cd19 car-t cell therapy has demonstrated response rates of 5090 in cd19 b-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-hodgkin lymphoma 36 the activation of car-t cells after an encounter with target cells leads to release of granzyme and perforin proliferation of the car-t cell population and a supraphysiologic increase in cytokines such as il-6 and interferon- this cytokine release syndrome crs may occur in up to 70 of patients depending on conditioning therapy and cell construct with icu admission rates up to 13 36 37 38 crs is grade 12 in the majority of patients but may be severe in 1247 of patients 37 crs typically presents within the first 6 days following car-t cell infusion with fever as the defining feature followed by hypotension tachycardia hypoalbuminemia with capillary leak and weight gain and consumptive coagulopathy 3638 immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome icans with a varied symptom profile table 1 may also be observed with later onset during an episode of crs or shortly after its resolution 3638 39 40 icans can also occur in patients who did not develop crs and this observation in addition to the separate timeline of development has resulted in the separation of icans from crs in the consensus grading system as a distinct toxicity 394142 crs may be observed after other tumour-directed immune therapies including the bi-specific t-cell engager drug blinatumumab 37for most people who contract covid-19 the clinical course is mild and often asymptomatic with the majority of those able to be recover from the disease at home individuals who require hospitalization most commonly present with fever cough fatigue and dyspnea 7 8 943 routine laboratory investigations on admission demonstrate lymphopenia elevated d-dimer and elevated crp chest imaging demonstrates bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacities 7 8 943 twelve to 31 of patients admitted to hospital will eventually develop severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and require critical care support 56943 severe covid-19 disease as per who-china working group definition includes the following respiratory frequency  30min blood oxygen saturation  93 pao2fio2 ratio  300 andor lung infiltrates 50 of the lung field within 2448 h 44 critical disease is defined as severe covid-19 with any of the following respiratory failure septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunctionfailure 44 while multi-organ failure is frequently reported in this population marked organomegaly has not been reported one of the emerging facets of severe covid-19 is the association with a hypercoagulable state d-dimer elevation was recognized early on in the pandemic to be an important prognostic marker for predicting severe disease and mortality 43 klok et al have reported a 31 incidence of thrombotic complications in covid patients admitted to the icu including demonstration of venous thromboembolism vte in 27 of patients 45 increased thrombotic risk is seen with many inflammatory states and reflects overlap in the regulation inflammation and thrombosis 46 the profound activation of thrombotic pathways may be a unique feature to covid-19 compared to other css but remains to be confirmed in further studiesin the pediatric population affected with covid-19 there have been emerging reports of a hyperinflammatory shock syndrome sharing features with an atypical kawasaki disease initial symptoms of fever conjunctivitis rash and gastrointestinal symptoms progress to shock requiring vasopressor support fluid accumulation and cardiac injury 47 the delayed-onset and profound rise in inflammatory markers suggest a secondary pathologic immune response that may share features with adult covid-css but further study is needed to confirm these observationsthere is no consensus definition of covid-css and it is prudent to recognize that not all patients with severe or critical covid-19 infection develop dysregulated immune response and toxic cytokine secretion 11 the working definition of covid-css at our institution used for consideration of adjunct immunomodulatory therapy is critical covid-19 with evidence of derangement of multiple inflammatory markers including ferritin 1000 gl and crp  100 mgl although we are presently analyzing other clinical and laboratory parameters and immune biomarkers such as il-1 and il-6 to produce a more nuanced definitionas the adult secondary hlh disorders result from many different etiologies and triggers an in-depth understanding of pathophysiology is lacking inferring from studies of the genetic defects in primary hlh patients the hlh syndrome results from the dysregulation and unrestrained activation of macrophages cytotoxic t-cells and nk cells leading to the observed end-organ damage 24253150 the inability to resolve certain infections and subsequent uncontrolled immune activation may explain the amplified inflammatory response in shlh from viral bacterial and fungal infections aberrant autonomous cytokine production from malignant cells of the immune system may develop into the hlh observed in lymphomas 242531 secondary hlh can complicate auto-inflammatory conditions sle stills disease etc with the inappropriate response to self-antigen driving continuous activation of t-cells and macrophages 2451 the observed responses to ifn- antibody therapy suggests this may be a key factor perpetuating the pathologic feedback loop of inflammation but murine models of primary hlh have implicated both ifn-  dependant and independent pathways 52 53 54the pathogenesis of imcd is less well understood than when the syndrome is driven by human herpesvirus 8 hhv-8 or poems increased il-6 is seen in the majority of patients and the response to il-6 targeted therapy has implicated dysregulation of this pathway as the main driver of disease 32 elevated vascular endothelial growth factor vegf levels and dysregulated mammalian target of rapamycin mtor signaling are also observed in some patients 3255 the cause of the elevated il-6 levels and inappropriate inflammatory activation is not known associations of imcd and autoimmune and malignant conditions may point to shared pathophysiology while as-yet-undiscovered infectious triggers have also been hypothesizedthe development and severity of crs correlates with car-t cell expansion but preclinical mouse studies have also shown monocyte and macrophage production of il-1 and il-6 to be the major drivers of the inflammatory response 3856 57 58 subsequent endothelial activation results in microvascular permeability and the clinical features of capillary leak hypotension and reduced serum albumin levels 38 autopsy evidence also suggests activated endothelial cells produce additional il-6 reinforcing the pathologic inflammatory feedback loop 59 eventual blood-brain barrier disruption as a result of increased il-6 levels and endothelial activation is thought to contribute to severe icans 37our understanding of covid-css is rapidly evolving with early clinical biochemical and autopsy observations supplemented by more thorough preclinical studies of the closely related sars-cov responsible for the 2003 sars outbreak mouse models of sars-cov suggest that delayed type i interferon signaling promotes accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory macrophages leading to hypercytokinemia vascular leakage and impaired t cell responses 60 deleting the ifn-gamma receptor or depleting macrophages protected mice from lethal infection without affecting viral load supporting that the inflammatory response may contribute more to severe disease pathology than direct viral effects 60 in a subset of patients with covid-19 disease severity seems to correlate with inflammatory markers commonly implicated in other cytokine storm disorders including il-2r il-6 il-10 and tnf cytokines 7810 in patients with covid-css development of sepsis need for intubation and ards are accompanied by worsening inflammatory markers and are observed between 7 and 14 days after illness onset consistent with clinical deterioration due to inflammatory sequelae 43 an autopsy series from 6 patients who died from covid-19 demonstrated il-6 production by virus-infected macrophages present in lymph nodes and spleen tissue suggesting that viral-infection leading to macrophage production of il-6 was the initial trigger for inflammatory dysregulation 61corticosteroids have been the cornerstone in managing hyper-inflammatory disorders due to their broad effects leading to reduced inflammatory mediators and immune cell activity used alone or in combination with cytotoxic therapies responses are frequent but often short-lived and associated with significant long-term toxicity the hlh-94 protocol combines upfront dexamethasone with etoposide for its specific reduction of t cell activity and cytokine production 6263 cyclosporine may be introduced after 8 weeks or after 1 week as per the hlh-2004 protocol though it is often poorly tolerated in adult patients 2426 despite the demonstrated efficacy in pediatric hlh syndromes adults treated with the hlh-94 protocol and its variations demonstrate poor long-term survival around 30 24 relapses in secondary hlh occur frequently either despite standard therapy or as therapy intensity is tapered mortality related to infectious or other complications of prolonged immunosuppression is also commonin imcd corticosteroids are frequently used as adjunct therapy for disease flares though only half of patients will demonstrate improvement with corticosteroids 32 as high dose corticosteroid therapy is poorly tolerated in the long term a number of lymphoma-like chemotherapy options have be used to treat patients with imcd 32 steroid-containing immunomodulatory regimens with thalidomide cyclophosphamide and prednisone has also shown promising efficacy and safety 64the use of corticosteroids in the management of crs following car-t cells is limited by the concern of unwanted cytotoxic effects on the car-t product reducing overall efficacy however given its effectiveness for rapidly reducing the systemic inflammatory burden in this population corticosteroids are still used second-line after directed anti-cytokine therapy 3637 steroids are particularly useful as first line therapy in the treatment of icans with cns penetrating steroids such as dexamethasone preferredcorticosteroids were used frequently in the management of covid-19 in the early days of the pandemic in china with reported use in 3079 of patients 47 8 94365 the indication for therapy is not widely reported and may be due to comorbid conditions copd asthma or as adjunct therapy for sepsis analysis has suggested improved outcomes in patients with ards treated with steroids though this has not been conclusive and ideal timing and patient selection are not known 94366 animal models and some human data of the closely related sars-cov infection have demonstrated early corticosteroid use may reduce initial inflammatory response but raise the concern of increased viral replication and shedding that could worsen clinical outcomes and increase viral transmission 6768improved mechanistic understanding of hyperinflammatory syndromes has led to therapies targeting specific cytokines implicated in disease pathogenesis emapalumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting interferon- that has demonstrated efficacy with overall response rates over 60 in a study of pediatric hlh 69 based on this trial the us food and drug administration fda approved emapalumab for use in refractory recurrent or progressive primary hlh in both children and adults 22 though there is a concern of secondary infections particularly from organisms responsive to ifn-gamma driven immune reactions the medication has been well tolerated in the majority of patients including those with infectious complications prior to therapy 546970 data are limited in the use of emapalumab for secondary hlh in adultsin imcd the disease process is thought to be dependent on elevated il-6 levels perpetuating the hyperinflammatory state in most patients therefore use of il-6 targeted therapy is now the front-line management for patients with imcd with or without adjunctive steroids siltuximab a monoclonal antibody directed against il-6 in a placebo controlled trial has shown reduction in tumour burden and symptomatic response in a third 34 of patients with responders having sustained disease control up to 6 years of follow-up 71 tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody directed against the il-6 receptor has demonstrated similar improvement in symptoms and biochemical markers of disease activity in a single arm study 72 anti-il-6 therapy is well tolerated for many years in patients with disease response though relapses may be common following cessation of therapy 3272the early observation of a substantial increase in il-6 during crs prompted the introduction of anti-il-6 agents for management of those receiving car-t therapy with good effect 73 tocilizumab is now fda approved for use in crs with response rates of 70 following 12 doses with a median time to response of 4 days 2237 doses can be repeated every 6 to 24 h until crs symptoms begin to improve as tocilizumab is only used in short courses for a limited period there is less concern of serious adverse events that may be seen in patients taking the drug long-term for rheumatologic indications tocilizumab administration has been demonstrated to not affect car-t cell efficacy and is thus the preferred first line agent over corticosteroids tocilizumab appears to be not as effective for icans likely because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier and targets the il-6 receptor with no direct il-6 lowering effect leading to elevated systemic il-6 levels after therapy without cns protection 384072 direct targeting of il-6 by siltuximab may have better cns response though this has not been studied in clinical trialsas il-6 levels correlate with disease severity in hospitalized covid-19 patients anti-il-6 therapy has been one of the first treatment strategies explored during the pandemic 7 8 9 10 there have been several published case reports as a well as two larger case series from china using tocilizumab as a treatment for severe covid-19 demonstrating biochemical efficacy with decrease markers of inflammation but the impact of clinical outcomes such as time in intensive care and mortality compared to supportive care remains unknown 74 75 76 77 78 79 a recent large series of 100 consecutive patients with severe covid-19 demonstrated clinical stability or improvement in 77 of patients following administration of tocilizumab 80 a press release for corimuno-toci nct04331808 a multi-centre open-label randomized controlled trial of tocilizumab in moderate and severe covid19 has suggested positive results and with the study currently under peer-review 81 optimal timing of tocilizumab initiation is unknown but there is sound rationale that earlier treatment in patients demonstrating a pathologic inflammatory response may ameliorate immune-mediated lung injury repeated doses of tocilizumab similar in strategy to its use in car-t cell related crs may be reasonable for patients with refractory covid-css serious risks of tocilizumab in the short term include a small risk of bowel perforation acute hepatic failure and osteonecrosis of the jaw 8283 case reports of hypertriglyceridemia and candidemia following tocilizumab infusion for covid-19 have been reported 8485 there is a concern that the use of tocilizumab in covid-19 could increase the risk of secondary infections and delay viral clearance as was postulated in the report of 2 cases of viral myocarditis following tociluzumab for covid-19 86 these safety concerns should be thoroughly evaluated in future studies clinical trials of tocilizumab siltuximab and sarilumab an il-6 receptor blocker are currently being conducted in patients with moderate and severe covid-19 though trials specifically evaluating these agents in the covid-css population are not yet plannedin addition to their well-known anticoagulant properties heparins are known to have anti-inflammatory effects with lowering of il-6 levels specifically described 87 88 89 in patients with covid-19 a retrospective study has observed reduction of il-6 levels in patients treated with low-molecular weight heparin lmwh 90 given the maturing evidence of increased thrombotic risk in covid-19 lmwh may be a good adjunct therapy for covid-css to reduce both il-6 driven inflammation and thrombotic risk optimal dosing strategies in patients without proven thromboembolic disease is not currently known but is being investigated in upcoming clinical trials nct04359277il-1-receptor blockade with anakinra has been used in case series and retrospective studies for hlh with a clinical trial currently ongoing 91 92 93 anakinra has been hypothesized to have utility for car-t crs and neurotoxicity based on the observation that il-1 elevations precede il-6 spike in murine crs models and treatment with anakinra therapy resulted in reduction of both cytokines 5658 anakinra has the added benefit of having a very short half-life compared to other anti-cytokine therapies a retrospective cohort study of 29 patients with covid-19 and moderate-to-severe ards and hyperinflammation crp 100 mgl andor ferritin 900 ngml treated with high dose anakinra demonstrated clinical improvement in 72 of patients and improved survival compared to historical controls 94tnf inhibiting agents are available for the management of other inflammatory conditions though at the time of this review no reports of tnf inhibition have been reported for covid-19 the use of tnf inhibitors has some potential concern these drugs have also been thought to trigger shlh in some case reports 95 96 97 clinical trials for tnf inhibition in covid-19 are plannedto implement cellular responses to cytokines cell surface receptors must connect these external environmental signals to the nucleus to guide gene expression cell proliferation and activity this bottle-neck of inflammatory communication through shared internal signaling molecular pathways has facilitated the creation of targeted therapies that inhibit multiple cytokine pathways simultaneously many cytokine and growth receptors signal through the janus kinase jak signal transducer of activators of transcription stat pathway this has spurred the development of small molecular jak inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory and neoplastic conditions 98 these agents may be advantageous for disease states in which broader inhibition of cytokine signaling is required to control inflammation compared to the targeted blockade of single cytokinesruxolitinib a jak12 inhibitor already approved for the therapy of myeloproliferative neoplasm and rheumatologic disorders has activity in murine hlh models by reducing inflammation through ifn- dependant and independent pathways this results in reduced activity and tissue infiltration of t-cells and neutrophils 5253 case series in relapsedrefractory hlh as well as a single case of upfront therapy for moderate severity hlh have described biochemical and clinical efficacy in treatment of hlh with ruxolitinib monotherapy 99 100 101 early phase clinical trials are ongoing but preliminary results have demonstrated biochemical hematologic and clinical recovery in the few patients enrolled thus far 102 importantly the treatment is tolerated well with few adverse events reported especially in contrast to standard regimens of prolonged chemotherapy combined with high dose steroidspatients with the tafro subtype of imcd will typically have a more aggressive course and most have no substantial response to il-6 blockade analysis of molecular signaling pathways active in imcd patients refractory to anti-il-6 agents has implicated downstream activation of the pi3kaktmtor pathway common to signaling of the t cell receptor and vegf pathways 103 use of the mtor inhibitor sirolimus has met with early success in limited numbers of patients and a clinical trial in il-6 blockade refractory tafro patients is underway 3255103 pre-clinical studies of cells obtained from patients with imcd have also indicated that jak inhibitors may be able to interrupt il-6 driven mtor pathway activation 55currently there are limited reports of the use of jak-stat or other cell signaling pathway inhibitors in the management of covid-css the use of jak inhibitors is attractive as the medications are well tolerated have short half-lives and have the potential to target numerous inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways simultaneously while ruxolitinib has been the agent most studied in hlh other jak inhibitors may have potential advantages baricitinib an oral jak12 inhibitor that is currently approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was recently identified by artificial intelligence-based technology as a potential immunomodulatory treatment strategy for sars-cov-2 104 at therapeutic doses baricitinib is predicted to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and viral entry into cells by blocking the ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 104 aak1 regulates endocytosis in numerous cell types expressing ace2 the receptor that mediates sars-cov-2 viral entry including lung at2 alveolar epithelial cells 104 because any agent that dampens the inflammatory response could lead to a potential loss of immune-mediated viral control the hypothesized anti-viral effect makes baricitinib an attractive investigational therapy over agents that target disordered inflammation alone of concern with baracitinib is the increased risk of thrombosis which may increase the rate of thrombotic complications already observed with covid-19 105 clinical experience with covid-19 is limited but a pilot study of 12 patients has demonstrated improvement in fever dyspnea and hypoxia with a lower rate of icu admission than a historical control cohort 106ferritin the iron storage protein and c-reactive protein crp are the acute phase reactants most widely available at hospitals for monitoring systemic inflammation hyperferritinemia is the most common feature to prompt further evaluation for secondary hlh with levels 10000 gl observed in 789 of adult patients and can frequently be in excess of 100000 gl 27107 patients with crs also demonstrate elevated ferritin levels with most patients reaching a peak over 3000 and many in excess of 10000 gl 3857 patients experiencing higher grade crs have greater median peak ferritin and crp though with significant overlap in the observed ranges 3857 similarly ferritin and crp levels in patients with covid-19 are reportedly higher in patients with severe compared to moderate disease and in patients who died compared to those that recovered 7810 in our experience with covid-css patients in the icu we have observed ferritin levels in the range of 100010000 gl with crp levels typically above 100 mgl hoiland r et al manuscript under reviewthe measurement of d-dimer a fibrin degradation product is a widely available test that shows active clot formation and breakdown its increase in systemic inflammation reflects the overlap between the physiologic inflammatory and thrombotic pathways though not frequently used in the evaluation of the cytokine storm disorders it has been correlated with severity of crs following car-t 38 d-dimer levels correlate with disease severity in covid-19 and admission d-dimer 1 gml has emerged as one of the earliest prognostic marker to identify patients with high mortality 43the pattern of inflammatory markers may be more useful than relying on absolute values alone in order to establish a diagnosis in children with sjia the ratio of ferritin to erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr was useful for identifying patients with mas 108 in one study of japanese hlh cases a ratio of sil-2r to ferritin was predictive of those with lymphoma-associated rather than benign disease 109the soluble interleukin-2 receptor sil2r level is integrated into the hlh-2004 diagnostic criteria 26 in adults with secondary hlh levels 2400 uml demonstrate good sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing adult hlh with an area under the curve of 090 95 confidence interval 083097 107 soluble il-2r levels have not been widely reported on in imcd but one study found elevated levels in 20 of 21 cases 34 additionally it was observed that for patients on anti-il-6 therapy sil-2r was one of the earliest markers that predicted disease relapse and failure of therapy 34110 in car-t crs it has been observed that sil2r levels are markedly elevated in patients with severe compared to non-severe disease 57 patients with covid-19 demonstrate higher sil2r levels in those with severe and fatal disease though levels have thus far reported to be typically less than 2000 uml 7810111il-6 is a key cytokine common to the pathophysiology of most css disorders and has important therapeutic implications in hlh data available in pediatric patients demonstrate moderate il-6 elevation though it has not been useful in distinguishing hlh from sepsis or other inflammatory conditions 112 idiopathic mcd is conceptualized as a primarily a disorder of il-6 elevation though serum il-6 levels in imcd may be normal or only mildly elevated response rates to il-6 blockade do correlate with baseline il-6 levels in imcd but many patients with low il-6 levels will improve with therapy while patients with high il-6 levels can show no response 3271 il-6 levels peak with disease flares in imcd and can be used to monitor disease course but once il-6 blockade is initiated serial monitoring is not useful tocilizumab and sarilumab block the receptor for il-6 leading to clinical improvement while serum il-6 levels will remain stable or increase 72 similarly il-6 levels cannot be accurately interpreted for 1218 months following the last dose of siltuximab car-t crs demonstrates substantial increases in il-6 that correlates with severity of crs and may be orders of magnitude greater the levels reported for imcd and hlh 3871112 in covid-19 il-6 levels have been high for patients with more severe and fatal disease 7810111 in our institutions experience with covid-css observed levels of il-6

inflammatory disorders in children but routine use for diagnosis in adults has not been studied 112113 following emapalumab therapy interferon- levels do not correlate with disease response but downstream targets of interferon such as cxcl9 and cxcl10 appear to have utility in monitoring disease activity and treatment response 5470use of cytokine measurements in css to diagnose and monitor disease activity and response to therapy is an area in need of further refinement monitoring response to therapy requires in depth knowledge of drug targets and expected impact on cytokine levels laboratory testing and downstream pathway activation more data research and experience are needed in order to develop the clinical acumen in interpretation of patterns and profiles of these diseasescovid-css has many clinical and pathologic similarities with other cytokine storm disorders therapy for classic css conditions such as imcd and secondary hlh has been hampered by low numbers of patients lack of diagnostic clarity and incompletely understood pathophysiology progress has been made with the introduction of targeted therapy aimed at interrupting the positive feedback loops of inflammatory pathways the story of crs following car-t cell therapy with comparatively rapid determination of pathophysiology and use of existing medications for treatment has been a recent success future goals for css include improved access to immunophenotyping and expression profiling to inform our understanding of disease mechanisms and enhancing diagnostic and monitoring capabilitiesdue to the lack of currently available evidence the nih guidelines for the management of covid-19 do not recommend for or against cytokine inhibition with il-1 and il-6 blockade and specifically recommend against off-label use of jak pathway inhibitors outside of clinical trial 12 current industry sponsored trials of sarilumab nct04327388 and tocilizumab nct04320615 in patients with severe-critical covid-19 are underway however they exclude critically ill patients requiring vasopressors and therefore will not address the question of whether these agents will be of benefit in those who are critically unwell with evidence of css development of consensus definitions for covid-css may lead to identification of patients most likely to benefit most from immune modulating therapy we should

 7 the direct cause of death from acute covid-19 is that the sars-cov-2 destroy the human immune mechanism and trigger excessive immunity causing cytokine storm moreover cytokine storm damages lungs and multiple organs of the human body like heart kidney and liver and eventually leading to multiple organ functions exhaustion 89 studies have shown that the sars-cov-2 enters cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 for this reason lung tissue has become the main invasion target of the sars-cov-2 with high expression of ace2 after the virus entered the lung the immune system sent a large number of immune cells to the lung tissue to kill the virus this formed pneumonia and the patient showed fever cough and difficulty breathing 4 however these immune cells cannot locate the virus accurately because they are not recognizing it they only attack indiscriminately and recruit more immune cells to kill the virus once a cytokine storm is formed the immune system may not be able to kill the virus but it will certainly kill a large number of normal cells in the lung which will seriously damage the function of the lung 12the cytokine release syndrome crs seems to affect patients with severe conditions since lymphocytopenia is often seen in severe covid-19 patients the crs caused by sars-cov-2 virus has to be mediated by leukocytes other than t cells as in patients receiving car-t therapy a high wbc-count is common suggesting it in association with lymphocytopenia as a differential diagnostic criterion for covid-19 10 one caveat is that mscs need to be activated by ifn to exert their anti-inflammatory effects which may be absent in severely affected patients as t cells are not well activated by sars-cov-2 infection to enhance effectiveness one could consider employing the licensing-approach pretreat mscs with ifn withwithout tnf or il-1 2 such cytokine-licensed mscs could be more effective in the suppression of hyperactive immune response and promotion of tissue repair as licensed-mscs are effective in lps-induced acute lung damage 11 lung damage is a major hurdle to recovery in those severe patients through producing various growth factors mscs may help repair of the damaged lung tissue it is important to mention that various studies have shown that in animal models with bleomycin-induced lung injury vitamin b3 niacin or nicotinamide is highly effective in preventing lung tissue damage 12however new interventions will most likely require a long time to develop a covid-2019 approved drug thus in light of the dire need and urgency to identify the treatment and control of covid-2019 a remodeling of the use of ifns has been identified as a possible option in coronavirus control based on the therapeutic details and recent infections precipitated by the human coronaviruses like sars-cov-2 mers and sars the potential drug options for sars-cov-2 infection include the use of enzyme inhibitors nucleosides host-targeted agents convalescent plasma and ifns 1314 in fact the ifns are low molecular weight proteins produced by infected cells after the pathogenic viral effect constitute the first line of defense against infections 15 the expression of the ifn-stimulated genes isgs are induced by ifn both in the infected and neighboring cells these facilitate the establishment of the antiviral state thus averting and limiting the viral replication fig 3
 1617 the ifns enhance the immune system in several ways exhibiting various biological functions including antiviral antiproliferative immunomodulatory and developmental activities 15 the ifns employed therapeutically are manufactured using recombinant dna technology and are administered as drugs in the treatment of treatment of viral infections some clinically approved ifns widely used as antiviral agents today are as listed ifn -2a roferon ifn -2b intron a ifn -n1 wellferon ifn -n3 alferon ifn  -con 1 infergen ifn -1a rebif ifn -1b betaferon ifn  -1a avonex ifn  -1b betaseron ifn  -2a pegasys ifn  -2b pegintron ifn  p-2b sylatron and ifn -1b acimmune 1819in a recent study on mers-cov the combination of remdesivir and ifn b revealed superior antiviral activity compared to the effect of lopinavir and ritonavir in vitro 20 research using ribavirin and ifn alpha-2a showed that the mers-cov infection treated with oral ribavirin and subcutaneous pegylated ifn alpha-2a signicantly improved the patients chances of survival if adequate monitoring and assessment can be ensured 21 the remdesivir and ifn beta-1b which is generally used to treat multiple sclerosis may prove useful in the treatment of covid-19 according to one review published in nature reviews in drug discovery 14 based on pathologic features and genetic homology in sars it was predicted that a cytokine storm also prevails in patients with sars-cov-2 infection causing covid-19 the blood sample of covid-19 patients there was a marked increase in interferon  ifn- and interferon-inducible protein 10 ip-10 compared to that of sars patients the placebo-controlled trial showed that the combination of interferon beta-1b lopinavir and ritonavir among patients with mers infection 4 the recombinant human ifn alfa-2b effectively counter the covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 as ifn stimulate the genes that produce viral rna enzymes which are responsible for destruction of viral rna proven that sars-cov-2 is an rna virus therefore treatment with interferon seems logical to combat covid-19 22 earlier studies showed that coronaviruses including mers sars human coronavirus 229e and avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv are susceptible to ifns 1723 coronavirus inhibition with ifn type i and type iii has clearly evinced a positive impact against the sars-cov and mers-cov infection using viral cell culture in animal experiments and possibly also in human patients 2425 effective results were also reported in patients with mers after treating them with a combination of ritonavir 2 ifn 2a or ifn -2b which resulted in a significantly improved survival rate after 14 days of treatment the retrospective research study revealed that the combination of ritonavir 2 ifn -1a had no significant effect on clinical outcome in patients infected with mers but the combination of ribavirin 1 ritonavir 2 ifn -2a inhibited and stopped the viremia within 48 h of treatment in an infected patient 13 in recent reviews on therapeutic options and drug discovery targeting coronaviruses provided details on use of recombinant ifns ifn - ifn - and exogenous ifns in the treatment of 2019-ncov sars-cov and mers-cov in fact they showed the ifn response inhibiting the protein synthesis and replication of the virus 2526 the study in lancet on the ifn  and  alone or in combination showed them to have partial efficacy against the animal coronaviruses as well as to inhibit the sars-cov replication in vitro the ifn  had the highest potency demonstrating prophylactic protection and antiviral potential post infection 27the evidence indicates the that the ifns alone or in combination with clinically approved antiviral drugs are effective against the sars-cov-2 coronavirus for use in the possible control of covid-2 the research data discussed herein demonstrated that the ifns can inhibit the coronaviral replication in vitro providing prophylactic protection and antiviral potential post infection thus the ifns from patients who recovered from viral infections can be used as a drug of choice alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs in the treatment and control of the sars-cov-2 without any significant severe adverse effects on human health therefore it might be worthwhile to test the safety and efficacy of human and recombinant ifns against the sars-cov-2-infected patients alone or in combination with other antiviral drugsat present there is any specific drug or therapy has been proven to be safe and effective for treating covid-19 there are no food and drug administration fda-approved drugs specifically to treat patients with covid-19 although reports have appeared in the medical literature and the lay press claiming successful treatment of patients with covid-19 with a variety of agents definitive clinical trial data are needed to identify optimal treatments for this disease the chemical agents previously used to treat sars and mers used as potential candidates to treat covid-19 the number of drugs and combinational therapies were identified by using previously approved drugs that could inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis targeting viral protease regulating immunity inhibiting the inflammatory cytokine surge improving pulmonary function and reducing lung viral loads as an inhibitor of the host cell serine protease and angiotensin receptor blockers lower the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and death and thereby inhibit viral infection of cells table 1
 also the treatments of covid-19 cytokine storm primarily focus on the anti-shock therapy treatment of symptoms life-saving first support and symptomatic treatment restoration of physical strength inhibit excessive immune cell activation and cytokine production and antibody-neutralizing cytokine storm includes neutralizing the monoclonal antibodies against elevated cytokines to prevent severe disease and death 28 recently a number of specific anti-cytokine approaches have proven effective in treating a variety of cytokine storm syndromes including those triggered by viruses these include drugs targeting interleukin-1 il-1 il-6 il-18 and interferon-gamma 29 while randomized trials will be needed to confirm which if any of these therapeutics will effectively treat covid-19-infected patients with cytokine storm syndrome il-6 blockade has recently been reported to be in use in china with successful outcomes in some individuals receiving this as part of their treatment 10 while working to prevent future outbreaks of deadly coronavirus infections with vaccine development and discovering new or re-purposed anti-viral medicines to treat the virus we must also use all the

reported that covid-19 has the same viral genome above 85 identity in the genome and pathophysiology mechanisms with the sars-cov 2 the covid-19 infection affecting all age-groups but it appears to be more severe in elderly adults 3 it seems that very high pro-inflammatory cytokine release which is described as cytokine storm is a pivotal pathophysiological mechanism in elderly covid-19 patients 4 aging is related to increased levels of systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased levels of systemic anti-inflammatory cytokines hence a chronic condition of inflammation may be created in aged subjects known as inflamm-aging 5 6 ample studies have indicated elevated levels of interleukin il-6 il-1 tumor necrosis factor- tnf  as well as c-reactive protein crp in aged subjects 7 8 although the exact underlying mechanism of cytokine storm in elderly adults with severe covid-19 infection is far from clear however it is likely that dysregulation of the cytokine homeostasis in inflame-aging phenomenon may play a critical role in the risk of a cytokine storm and subsequently acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in some elderly patients with severe covid-19 infection it seems that cytokine storm phenomenon in elderly patients with severe covid-19 infection is associated with many age-related pathophysiologic processes including alteration of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor expression 9 excess ros production 10 alteration of autophagy 11 the inflammatory phenotype of senescent cell activity particularly adipose tissue 12 and immune-senescence 13 as well as lack of vitamin d content 14 here we are going to review and discuss all above mentioned age-related pathophysiological pathways that appear to contribute to the dysregulation of cytokine networks and possibly a cytokine storm in elderly patients with severe covid-19 infectionit has been shown that covid-19 infection has distinctive behavior among elderly adults severe infection as compared with children and young adults none or mild infection indeed covid-19 infection can induce severe infection including pneumonia and ards in some elderly adults or sick patients and not in children or young adults 15 what is the reason that the deadly cases of covid-19 mainly seen in elderly patients here first we are going to review and compare the possible pathophysiology mechanisms of mild infection and severe infection in young and elderly adults with covid-19 respectivelydespite increasing evidences on the immune response to pathogens however less is known about the exact immunologic mechanism of covid-19 infections as shown in fig 1 initiation of the immune response against invading coronavirus begins with a direct infection of the bronchi and bronchiole epithelium first antigen-independent innate immunity provides the first line of leukocytes defense against microorganisms innate immune defense involves several cell types including leukocytes such as neutrophils eosinophils basophils monocytes macrophages lung epithelial cells mast cells natural killer nk cells 16 following initial covid-19 infection lung-resident dendritic cells dcs become activated and change to antigen-presenting cells apcs indeed apcs are the first line of defense in recognizing various pathogens in the lung dcs resides in and below the airway epithelium the alveolar septa pulmonary capillaries and airway spaces 17 activated apcs ingests and processes an antigen and migrate to the lymph nodes then in the lymph nodes apc presents the antigen in the form of mhcpeptide complex to nave circulating t helper cells th0 inducing the immune response 18 following activation of th0 receptor by mhcpeptide complex t helper cells become activated proliferate and differentiated to cd4 t helper lymphocytes and cd8 cytotoxic t lymphocytes cells then cd4 th lymphocytes further differentiated into th1 and th2 with different cytokine profiles 19 th1 cells drive cellular immunity and released pro-inflammatory cytokines such as ifn- il-1 il-12 and tnf- 17 it is reported that cytokine ifn- can inhibit viral replication and enhance antigen presentation 20 th2 cells activated humoral immunity and antibody production and released anti-inflammatory cytokines such as tgf- il-4 il-5 il-9 il-10 and il-13 21 in fact a balanced between th1 and th2 lymphocyte activity is observed in healthy adults with covid-19 infection furthermore cd8 t lymphocytes cytotoxic t cells as cytotoxic cells secrete cytotoxic molecules such as granzyme b that kill infected epithelial cells indeed cd8 t lymphocytes and natural killer cells nk play a critical contribution in viral clearance 17 both t and b cell responses against covid-19 observed in the systemic blood pool 1 week after the initiation of covid-19 symptoms the autopsy of a patient with covid-19 identified an accumulation of mononuclear cells likely monocytes and t cells in the lungs with low levels of hyperactive t cells in the peripheral blood these findings suggested that likely t cells are attracted away from the systemic blood pool and into the infected site lung to control the covid-19 infection 21 generally activation of different th cells and release of ample cytokines and chemokines recruit more innate cell-mediated and humoral immunologic responses to control covid-19 in adults additionally it seems that the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune responses in the healthy adult can shut down immune activity at the right moment 22the renin-angiotensin system ras is an important regulator of several physiologic events including cardiovascular and blood volume natriuresis diabetes chronic renal disease and hepatic fibrosis 37 38 this system is composed of two different pathways including angiotensin-converting enzyme aceangiotensin ii ang iiangiotensin receptor type 1 at1 aceang iiat1 pathway and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2ang 17mas receptor ace2ang 17mas pathway these two pathways have opposing effects to accommodate a coordinated response to specific triggers the activity of aceang iiat1 pathway related to tissue injury inflammation and fibrosis 39 in contrast the activity of the ace2ang 17mas pathway exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis effects 39 40 ace2 degrades ang ii as a major substrate for ace2 and generates ang-17 38 recently it is well accepted that ace2 on lung epithelial cells are the entry-point receptors for covid-19 particles 41 it is demonstrated that the highest expression of ace2 is in the lungs type ii alveolar epithelial cells kidney heart and also vascular beds 37 yu and colleagues in 2018 revealed that ace2ang-17mas pathway markedly suppressed in pancreatitis by inhibition of the p38 mapknf-b signaling pathway 38 fu and colleagues in 2017 transfected ace2 plasmid in primary cultured human retinal pigment epithelium cells hrpe followed by stimulation with amyloid- a they observed that overexpression of ace2 markedly decreased a-induced inflammatory response by activating the ace2ang-17mas pathway in hrpe 42 in the respiratory syncytial virus ace2 protected against severe lung injury both in children and an experimental mouse model in addition in the ards model ace2 knockout mice displayed more severe symptoms of respiratory shut down compared with wild-type mice 43 indeed treatment strategy using ace2 analogs or vector containing ace2 result in beneficial effects in diabetic nephropathy hypertension cardiac disease 37 specific inhibitors of at1 receptors losartan have been shown to be effective in animal models of septic shock therefore the above mentioned studies suggested that ace2 pathway has anti-inflammatory effects several studies identified age-related decline of ace2 expression 40 44 45 for example in the study of xudong and colleagues in 2006 revealed age-related difference of ace2 expression revealed in rat lung they observed ace2 expression is significantly reduced with aging they are suggesting the more elevated ace2 in young adults as compared to age groups may contribute to the predominance in sars attacks in this age group 44 using gtex gene expression data and analysis chen and colleagues in 2020 found markedly higher expression of ace2 in asian females compared to males furthermore they found an age-dependent decline of ace2 expression and also a highly significant decrease in type ii diabetic patients additionally they established a negative correlation between ace2 expression and covid-19 fatality interestingly in severe cases many vital tissues including those with little ace2 expressed are severely damaged by covid-19 infection 45 these evidences may partially suggest that the increase concentration of ace2 receptors in lung epithelial cells in children and young adults may have a protective effect on severe clinical manifestations due to covid-19 infection therefore it is highly likely that low ace2 expression and unbalance ang iiang17 level during aging can lead to cytokine storm and lung shut down 40 41 however the genetic basis of ace2 expression and its function in different individuals is still far from clear 46it is well accepted that ros considered as a signaling molecule at low concentrations and also as a mediator of inflammation at high concentrations 47 the main sources of ros are mitochondrial respiratory chain and nadph oxidase 48 garrido and colleagues in 2019 identified that the immune cells of pre-maturely aging mice presented lower values of antioxidant defenses and higher values of ros and pro-inflammatory cytokines 10 hence it is suggested that excess ros production during aging can turn on an inflammatory machine and subsequently increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tnf- il-1 il-2 and il-6 and adhesion molecules the excess ros production in aging can initiate the pro-inflammatory generation through activation of multiple transcription factors including human polynucleotide phosphorylase hpnpaseold-35 nuclear factor kappa b nf-b activator protein 1 ap-1 specificity protein 1 sp1 peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ppars 49 50 for example it is reported that hpnpaseold-35 which is up-regulated during senescence may promote the activation of nf-b pathway and initiates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 and il-8 51 furthermore the expression of hpnpaseold-35 itself induces ros production this suggests that hpnpaseold-35 could be an upstream signaling molecule that increased ros generation and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokines during aging in addition to hpnpaseold-35 nf-b is also an important transcription factor that up-regulated during aging by excess ros production in resting states an inhibitory protein ikb inactivated nf-b in the cytoplasm however ros production can phosphorylate inhibitory ikb proteins leading to nuclear translocation of nf-b and regulation of gene transcription then activated nf-b can initiate the secretion and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tnf-a il-1 il-6 il-8 ifn-g inos cox-2 50 interestingly as the excess ros production can increase pro-inflammatory cytokines the pro-inflammatory cytokines can also increase ros production 52 for instance it has been identified that the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-6 can increase ros generation by increased expression of nadph oxidase-4 in lung cancer 53 additionally it has been demonstrated that the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon- and the pro-inflammatory component of the bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharide can synergistically increase ros generation in human pancreatitis by nf-b-dependent expression of duox2 a member of the nadph oxidase family 54 hence excess ros production and inflammation are closely related which are taking part in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation and inflame-aging in elderly adultsautophagy is a conserved catabolic turnover pathway in eukaryotic cells by which cellular material delivered into the lysosomes for degradation autophagy process is related to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and its dysregulation could lead to the development of several aging-related pathophysiological diseases 11 it has been shown that the autophagy process decrease during aging leads to the accumulation of damaged macromolecules and organelles the decline of autophagy during aging can induce dysfunctional mitochondria and subsequent increased ros production 55 mitochondria are the major source of ros in this context two major processes are for protection from harmful effects of ros including mitophagy and antioxidant capacity in one hand mitophagy which is characterized by autophagic degradation of mitochondria decreased with aging 56 on the other hand decreased mitophagy together with decreased antioxidant capacity during aging can increased ros levels in the body the excess production of ros in stress condition leading to memory deficits anxiety-like behavior and increase pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion during aging 5760 although the exact underlying mechanism of how the decline in autophagy and a rise in ros levels during aging can elevate pro-inflammatory cytokine release is far from clear however it is well accepted that low activity of autophagy process and high level of ros production during aging can activate and up-regulate nod-like receptors nlrs 54 the nlrs are a type of intracellular pattern-recognition receptors prrs for pathogen recognition they monitor both inflammation and apoptosis signaling pathways these receptors expressed in many cell types including immune cells lymphocytes macrophages dendritic cells and even epithelial cells 61 it is observed that activation of cytosolic nlrs increased during aging and in many age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus for example from ebersole and colleagues study in 2017 identified that expression of nlrs increased with aging in the healthy oral mucosa 62 additionally luan and colleagues in 2018 found that nlrp3 expression increased in concanavalin a-induced hepatitis as a model of autoimmune hepatitis 63 salminen and colleagues in 2012 reported that the decrease of autophagic capacity during aging generates the inflammatory situation by means the activation of pro-inflammatory factors in particular nlrp3 55 it is accepted that nlrs activity can increase expression of caspase-1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-1 and il-18 leading to cell death fig 3 for example nadatani in 2016 reported that caspase-1 can induce pyroptosis a unique form of programmed cell death through the conversion of pro-il1 and pro-il18 in their active forms which promotes further inflammation in pyroptosis the dying cells release their cytoplasmic pro-inflammatory contents into the extracellular fluid 64 similarly wangs and colleagues revealed that treatment of ac-yvad-cmk an inhibitor of nlrp3-caspase-1 suppressed isoflurane-induced microglial inflammatory response in aged mice 65 this finding is a critical study for supporting that nlrp3caspase-1 pathway is involved in the pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory disease in elderly adults fig 3 furthermore stranks in 2015 found that macrophages from aged mice exhibit markedly reduced autophagic flux as compared to young mice they also reported that reduced autophagy during aging increased macrophage populations and their phagocytosis function decreased surface antigen expression while the increased the inflammatory cytokine response 66 additionally in animal model studies increase autophagy by means caloric restriction and also exercise result in down-regulation of il-1 production and improve the aging-related pro-inflammatory profile so it seems that crosstalk between the decline of mitophagy pathways and elevated ros level during aging can imbalance immune system activity of elderly adults 67senescent cells accumulate with aging in many animal and human tissues leading to chronic inflammation and organ dysfunction 68 senescent cells have lower cell viability as well as insufficient protection against oxidative stress 69 additionally senescent cells can release pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-1 il-1 il-6 il-8 il-18 ccl-2 tnf- granulocyte macrophages colony-stimulating factor gm-csf growth regulated oncogene gro monocyte chemotactic protein mcp-2 mcp-3 mmp-1 mmp-3 70 71 so the immune effector is not the main source of inflammatory markers aging studies revealed the importance of adipose tissue inflammation in aged animals by the elevated release of interleukin 6 il-8 il-1 as well as tnf- 6870 adipose tissue is a dynamic structure that plays an important contribution in modulating of metabolism and inflammation it is highly likely that adipose tissue dysfunction for instance obesity during aging is associated with chronic inflammation in aged subjects 12 petrakis and colleagues in 2020 reported that age-related obesity leading to increased susceptibility of more serious complications of covid-19 as compared to younger individuals in obese covid-19 patients the adipose tissue interacts with the immune system and increased the lethality of the infection by fat tissue-associated cytokines adipokines release adipocytes released amyloid-a an adipokine which act directly on macrophages and increased generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines the mortality rate for young adults with covid-19 with normal body mass index was approximately 2 however the mortality rate for obese elderly adults with covid-19 was approximately 14 72 in addition to obesity covarrubias and colleagues found that during aging senescent cells significantly accumulate in visceral white adipose tissue and inflammatory cytokines found in the supernatant from senescent cells which are induced macrophages to proliferate and to express cd38 as a t cell activation marker 73 alicka and colleagues in 2020 found that adipose-derived stem cells from older groups exhibited increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory gene and mirnas such as il-8 il-1 tnf- mir-203b-5p and mir-16-5p and apoptosis markers such as p21 p53 caspase-3 caspase-9 69 ghosh and colleagues in 2016 reported that decreased autophagy activity during aging associated with increased adipose tissue er stress and inflammation in old adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction cells svfs in mice they also revealed that accumulation of autophagy substrates lc3-ii and p62 increased in old svfs implicated impaired autophagy activity furthermore they reported that old svfs had reduced expression of autophagy markers they also analyzed that decreased autophagy activity in old svfs is correlated with increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6 and mcp-1 74 therefore the elevated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by senescence adipocytes possibly leads to the elevated risk of the cytokine storm in covid-19 infection in poor prognosis patientswith progressive age the function of the innate and adaptive immune system undergoes physiological and morphological alteration throughout a lifetime which is characterized as an immune-senescence 13 75 indeed immune-senescence is described as the progressive loss of all immune effectors in both the innate and cell-mediated immune systems with aging 76 a normal and physiologic immunity depends on effective cross-talk between innate and adaptive immune systems so senescent immune effectors markedly impact on the health of elderly individuals 75 here we are going to briefly report age-related alteration of both innate and adaptive immune cells macrophages are central effector cells of the innate immune system and have many physiological functions 77 macrophage can produce several pro- tnf il-1 and il-6 and anti-inflammatory il-10 tgf acute phase proteins and glucocorticoids molecules enzymes growth factors nitric oxide toxic reactive radicals metalloproteinases and inhibitors of metalloproteinases as the clearance of pathogens proceeds the anti-inflammatory effectors of macrophages turn off macrophage inflammatory activities 78 therefore during a pathogen-induced inflammatory episode the balance of macrophage modulating secretion present in the tissues during aging the generation of several macrophage-induced factors is reduced including fibroblast growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor epithelial growth factor tgf toxic free radicals and expression of nitric oxide synthase additionally phagocytic and chemotactic activity of macrophages also decreased by a decline in production of macrophage-specific chemokines including macrophage inflammatory protein mip-1 and mip-2 with advanced age macrophages can also display antigen-presenting activity by expressing major histocompatibility class mhc leading to a cross-talk between innate and cell-mediated immune system it is reported that with progressive age the expression of mhc-ii decreased in both mice and humans 79 80 natural killer nk cells are another cytotoxic effector of the innate immune system and involved in the early and fast faster than t cells defense against virus infection and other challengers 81 the nk cells such as macrophages linking innate and cell-mediated immune system nk cells regulate immune function by the generation and release of various cytokines 82 an increase in numbers of circulating nk cells reported during aging 75 one of the important cytokines for cytotoxic activity of nk cells is il-2 which increases killing properties and proliferation of nk cells in a healthy young individual il-2 can induce ifn secretion by nk cells but this effect decreased in elderly 83 furthermore aging can change the nk cells phenotypes which are an increase in cd56dim cells and a decrease in cd56bright cells in addition aging can increase the expression of the immune-senescence marker cd57 on nk cell populations 84 dendritic cells dcs are another component of the innate immune system and have a critical role in both immunity and tolerance the resident dcs are immature but the capture of pathogens converts them to mature form known as antigen-presentation cells apcs through up-regulation of mhc expression then mature apcs monitor th1 and th2 function in contrast immature dcs induce tolerance to self-antigens 25 in physiological condition dcs take up self- antigen and apoptotic cells and transport them to the lymph nodes 85 but during migration for the presentation of pathogens to th0 cells they undergo several phenotype alterations including up-regulation of mhc class i and ii molecules and down-regulation of adhesion molecules 86 furthermore dcs can generate and release various cytokines so they can modulate inflammatory responses 87 it is reported that increased age-related pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce activation and maturation of dcs panda and colleagues in 2010 identified an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines released from dcs in elderly adults 88 moreover the activity of dcs in elderly adults was higher than young individuals 89 ageing is also accompanied by profound and consistent alterations of t-cell immunity 90 although t-cell numbers do not diminish during aging however the t-cell pool exhibit potent age-related alterations including poor t-cell mitogen responses an inverted cd4cd8 t-cell ratio reduced proportion of naive cells as well as an increased proportion of memory cells in older animals and human 91 additionally aging is related to the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by t cells leading to immune pathology 92 the cd8cd28 subset of cells in the expanded memory cell population has shortened telomeres suggesting that they have a longer reflective history 93 in humans almost all t cells express cd28 at birth and the proportion of cd28 declines by the age 81 93 the increase in these cells has been observed consistently and is used as a prognostic indicator of immune-senescence in older populations 94 it is demonstrated that aging also changes the cytokine profile of th2 cells il-4 and il-10 rather than th1 type il-2 ifn-g leading to mild age-related inflammation in elderly adults aging can also potentially affect other th cells pool the ratio of th17 cells tregulatory cells increased during aging leading to a basal inflammatory state in elderly adults 95 th17 cells have the pro-inflammatory phenotype and they are in balance with tregulatory anti-inflammatory cells these cells are derived from a common precursor th0 96 tregulatory cells are a subset characterized by a high expression of cd25 and foxp3 a transcriptional factor for the function and differentiation of tregulatory cells 97 in addition to anti-inflammatory effects of tregulatory cells also recognize self-antigens 98 furthermore ageing is correlated with disruption of lymphocyte telomerase up-regulation 99 it is accepted that shortened lymphocyte telomeres are associated with a variety of age-associated pathologies 100 furthermore during aging nave t-cells show multiple alterations including the shortening of telomeres the reduced production of il-2 and the diminished ability to differentiate themselves into effector-cells the loss in the number and function of the nave t-cells with increasing of t cd8 cd45ro cd25 clones in aged subjects 101 cd28-cells are responsible for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and are resistant to apoptosis it is proposed that they are undergoing cells to senescence due to the shortening of telomeres and reduction of the proliferative capacity 102 interestingly pro-inflammatory cytokines have been also implicated in these age-associated alterations of t-cell immune-senescence indeed inflammatory conditions in elderly adults lead to alterations in t-cell immunity for instance age-related increased cytokine tnf is a potent stimulator of tcd4 cell senescence and t-cell differentiation 90 humoral immunity mediated by b lymphocytes has a critical role in the modulation of adaptive immunity responses b lymphocytes produce different types of antibodies for eliminating of challengers additionally b lymphocytes have an important role in the immune system through the presentation of antigens and secretion of cytokines 103 b lymphocytes arising from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow as pro-b lymphocytes then they differentiate into pre-b and then b lymphocytes 104 ample studies identified that aging is accompanied by quantitative and qualitative alteration of b lymphocyte pool 105 the number of b lymphocytes and the levels of serum immunoglobulin and antibody analyzed during the aging the hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow from aged mice are less effective at generating both b lymphocytes as compared to young mice the number and the size of the germinal centers of b lymphocytes also decreased with aging production of precursor b lymphocytes in the bone marrow and the number of pro-b and pre-b lymphocytes decreased in aged mice and human 104 it has been shown that aged pro-b lymphocytes have
an impaired ability to respond to il-7 also both human nave and igm memory b lymphocytes impaired during aging 106 the percentage of igm memory b lymphocytes are not markedly decreased however the total numbers of b lymphocytes decreased additionally the antibody level is decreased in the aged subjects in addition the affinity and protective ability of antibodies in aged mice decreased as compared to the young mice 75 107 it is also reported that the immune response to influenza in old mice has less igg level than in young mice also young mice had mostly igg1 plasma level with high-affinity antibody in contrast aged mice mostly had igm plasma cells 108 hence antigen-specific antibody responses decline in old mice the decreased function of b lymphocytes such as antigen-specific antibody response and antibody affinity during aging has been attributed to lack of th function because the function of b lymphocytes is t-dependent 97 109 taken together immune-senescence alterations cannot properly fit cell-mediating and humeral immune response in elderly adults the immune system appears to maintain a mild inflammatory state in elderly adult therefore it is suggested that fragile and mildly over-active immune system in elderly adults cannot turn off the pro-inflammatory machine in covid-19 infection clinical findings in severe patients with covid-19 infection are in consistent with the above mention literature several manifestations including lymphopenia reduced numbers of cd4 t cells cd8 t cells b cells and natural killer nk cells monocytes eosinophils and basophils reported in severe patients with covid-19 infection 25 schouten and colleagues in 2019 identified that increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines during aging also correlated with the severity of ards and may partially explain age-dependent difference 110vd together with vitamin d receptor vdr has both classical functions such as bone and calcium-phosphorus homeostasis and non-classical function such as anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory function 111 112 vdr is expressed by several types of immune cells including monocytes macrophages b and t lymphocytes as well as dcs 113 additionally the -1-hydroxilase enzyme which converts inactive metabolite of vd 25oh d3 to the active form 125oh2d3 is expressed by the majority of immune cells such as macrophages 112 liu and colleagues in 2014 reported that the expression of vdr and -1-hydroxylase increased in macrophages following exposure to a pathogen 114 this finding suggested that the intracrine immune-regulatory function of vd as shown in fig 4 vd can decrease the expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as tnf- il-6 monocyte chemotatic protein1 mcp-1 and il-12 in immune cells through suppressing excessive ros production increasing intracellular glutathione levels suppressing nf-b and p38 map kinase expression excess ros production can increase nf-kb expression in immune cells leading to excess secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tnf-a il-1 il-6 il-8 ifn-g inos cox-2 50 activation of p38 map kinase pathway can also increase il-6 and mcp-1 generation in immune cells by stimulation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription15 stat15 115 it seems that pathogen challengers turn macrophages on by stimulation of pprs such as tlr21or nlrs activation of tlrs or nlr can increase intracellular vdr and -1-hydroxylase expression then a complex of vd and vdr together can decrease the pro-inflammatory cytokines increase the autophagy activity of macrophages and antimicrobial product generation including cathelicidin and -defensin in macrophages 116 in addition of immune regulatory effects of vd on macrophages it can also suppress the differentiation and migration of human dcs and decrease the expression of mhcii on dcs which are characterized as the tolerogenic properties 114 117 tolerogenic dcs can increase the number of il-10 producing cd4 t-cells and tregulatory cells elevated circulating cd4 tregulatory have of anti-inflammatory functions and also attenuated the inflammatory response of t-effector cells these tolerogenic actions of dcs are mediated by increased expression of foxp3 transcription factor 118 furthermore vd can also make a complex with vdr on the t lymphocytes leading to suppression of its proliferation hoe and colleagues in 2016 reported that vd markedly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf- ifn- and il-1 il-8 ifn- in response to bacterial ligands exposure vd also increased the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 119 hence vd can modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses elderly adults are at risk for vd deficiency due to several factors including decreased pre-vd production poor skin integrity decreased dietary intake of vd increasing adiposity obesity decreased renal function as well as less time spent outdoors 120 vd deficiency has been linked to various aging-related inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis asthma inflammatory bowel disease multiple sclerosis cardiovascular disease hypertension diabetes mellitus and cancer 121 additionally there is a correlation between vd deficiency and risk of respiratory tract infection such as covid-19 122 for example ilie and colleagues in 2020 examine the association between the mean levels of vd in 20 european countries and morbidity and mortality caused by covid-19 their analysis data identified negative correlations between mean levels of vd average 56 mmoll in each country and the number of covid-19 cases in addition a negative correlation was observed between mean levels of vd and the mortality of covid-19 cases they also reported that vd levels are severely low in the aging population especially in spain italy and switzerland the most vulnerable countries in relation to covid-19 123 additionally ebadi and montano-loza in 2020 reported that vd can suppress the expression of pro-inflammatory markers including il-1 il-1 as well as tnf- therefore vd deficiency during aging related to overexpression of th1 cytokines they also reported that 50 of patients with covid-19 and about 70 mortality of covid-19 observed in african-american population in chicago who are at a greater risk for vd deficiency 124 there are reports that polymorphism of vdr gene including polymorphisms of foki apai and taqi is associated with vd deficiency and increased risk of inflammatory diseases 125 hence vd and vdr pathway together have an important anti-inflammatory function in immune effectors through decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine generation and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines in immune cells furthermore the lack of vd in aged subjects is associated with the pro-inflammatory phenotype of immune cells leading to likely increasing the risk of elderly adults with chronic mild inflammation condition 122 this chronic inflammatory condition likely leads to cytokine storm in elderly covid-19 patientsin summary it seems that young adults have balanced between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine networks fig 1 therefore their balanced immune system can limit the progression of covid-19 infection however elderly patients do not have the same balanced immune response as young adults as shown fig 5 with advancing age the immune system appears to maintain a condition of mild inflammation so the activation of the body with pathogens such as covid-19 infection can exaggeratedly increase the amplitude of the immune response which is known as a cytokine storm as mentioned above alteration of ace2 receptor expression oxidative stress adipose tissue- and immune-senescent cell activity lack of vd content as well as decrease of autophagy and mitophagy may contribute to high amplitude of the immune response to external challengers in elderly adults this high amplitude of the immune response in elderly adults can favor induction of the cytokine storm and death in severe and critical cases of covid-19 infection nevertheless the covid-19 infection is not deadly in all elderly patients because the aging process is dependent on several markers including genes lifestyles individual variety of immune responses to challengerscoronaviruses are common human and mammalian positive-strand rna viruses 1 in december 2019 a new strain of coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was identified as the pathogenic cause of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as of april 21 2020 there were 2397217 confirmed cases of and 162956 deaths from covid-19 worldwide 2although most patients with covid-19 experience only mild-to-moderate disease approximately 15 progress to severe pneumonia and 5 develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock andor multiple organ failure which can rapidly lead to death 3 no vaccines or specific antiviral treatments have yet proven effective against covid-19 current clinical management consists of palliative treatments with organ support to moribund patients understanding the immunopathologic mechanism and appropriately targeting the key pathways involved has the potential to minimize pulmonary immune injury and mortalityfollowing infection sars-cov-2 binds to alveolar epithelial cells and activates innate and adaptive immune responses 1 cd4 and cd8 t cells play an important role in balancing the adaptive immune response against pathogens and the potential development of autoimmunity or excessive inflammation 4 activation of cytotoxic cd8 t cells is vital for clearing virus from infected cells but also induces immune injury in tissues 5 on the other hand rapidly activated cd4 t cells become pathogenic t helper 1 cells that generate pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 6 the marked production of cytokines and chemokines leads to recruitment of lymphocytes and leukocytes to the site of infection however a massive release of cytokines can occur as part of a positive feedback loop associated with immune response amplification resulting in cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm 1cytokine storm appears to be a common manifestation in severe covid-19 compared with healthy controls patients with covid-19 experienced elevated plasma levels of interleukin il-1 il-1r il-2 il-4 il-6 il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 il-13 il-17 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor g-csf granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf interferon gamma ifn- interferon gammainduced protein 10 ip-10cxcl10 monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein mip-1 platelet-derived growth factor-bb mip-1 basic fibroblast growth factor tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf- and vascular endothelial growth factor 7 furthermore patients admitted to the intensive care unit had higher plasma levels of il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1 and tnf- compared with patients who did not require critical care the high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to massive immune cell infiltration of the lungs in patients with covid-19 resulting in alveolar damage decreased lung function and rapid progression to death 78 indeed respiratory failure from ards is the leading cause of mortality associated with covid-19 910among the cytokines implicated in covid-19associated cytokine storm several signal predominantly via the janus kinase jaksignal transducer and activator of transcription stat pathway il-2 il-6 il-7 il-10 ifn- g-csf and gm-csf are dependent on jak1 jak2 or both furthermore ip-10 mcp-1 and mip-1 are ifn- dependent 1112 tnf- has been shown to activate jakstat signaling in a tnf receptor 1dependent manner 1314 these data suggest that jak inhibition could ameliorate the hyperinflammatory state associated with severe covid-19ruxolitinib incb018424 is a selective inhibitor of jak1 and jak2 that is approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis mf polycythemia vera and steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease sr-agvhd 15 the in vitro pharmacology of ruxolitinib has been studied using enzymes and cell-based assays in biochemical assays ruxolitinib has demonstrated potent inhibition of jak1 and jak2 with half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 values in the single digit nanomolar range table 1
 16 ruxolitinib has consistently demonstrated robust inhibition of jakstat signaling in cell-based assays in whole blood assays for the inhibition of phosphorylated stat3 following stimulation with il-6 a prototype cytokine that signals through jak1 or tpo a cytokine that signals exclusively through jak2 ic50 values were approximately 300 nm ruxolitinib has demonstrated specificity for jak1 and jak2 in biochemical assays compared with a broad panel of non-janus kinases and other receptors and ion channels similarly following incubation with ruxolitinib the viability of cells with constitutive jakstat signaling was effectively inhibited whereas the viability of cells relying on constitutive activation of other tyrosine kinases eg bcr-abl was not affected attesting to its on-target cellular activitysuppression of cytokine signaling by ruxolitinib has also been observed in in vivo preclinical models treatment with ruxolitinib 90 mgkg twice daily bid resulted in significant suppression of elevated il-6 levels and normalization of elevated tnf- levels in mice bearing a jak2
v617f-driven malignancy 16 in a separate report tnf- and il-12 levels were significantly lower on day 4 after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant in mice treated with ruxolitinib 30 mgkg bid dosed on days 1 through 20 compared with those treated with vehicle 17 on days 8 and 14 tnf- levels remained significantly lower with ruxolitinib treatmentthe effect of ruxolitinib was also evaluated in a major histocompatibility complexmismatch mouse model of agvhd characterized by significant upregulation of inflammatory cytokines ifn- tnf- and il-6 in peripheral blood fig 1
 18 ruxolitinib 60 mgkg bid treatment significantly reduced the inflammatory cytokine milieu in circulation no differences were observed in the proportion of peripheral cd4 or cd8 t cells in groups treated with ruxolitinib fig 2
 and there were no detrimental effects on donor engraftment these alloreactive gvhd data are consistent with previous reports suggesting that ruxolitinib has immunomodulatory but not immune-depleting effects 1719data supporting reduction of the cytokine burden has emerged from multiple clinical studies with ruxolitinib mf is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm with progressive cytopenias bone marrow fibrosis and splenomegaly driven by a hyper-inflammatory state 20 plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including ifn- il-6 il-8 il-16 il-18 as well as c-reactive protein intracellular adhesion molecule 1 vascular adhesion molecule 1 and matrix metalloproteinase 2 were significantly higher at baseline in patients with mf compared with healthy controls fig 3a after one cycle of therapy with ruxolitinib 28 days levels of these pro-inflammatory biomarkers decreased fig 3b these changes were not related to jak2 mutational status or disease subtype indicating that the effects of ruxolitinib in patients with mf are reflective of a broad anti-inflammatory effect in addition constitutive phosphorylation of stat3 andor stat5 was observed at baseline in patients with mf and a dose- and time-dependent reduction of phosphorylated stat3 was observed after treatment with ruxolitinib these observations suggest that the dampening of cytokine levels is related to on-target inhibition of jakstat signaling by ruxolitinib at starting doses of 1520 mg bid ruxolitinib resulted in reduced spleen size improvement in mf-related symptoms and improved overall survival in the phase 3 comfort-i and comfort-ii studies of patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk mf 2021 anemia and thrombocytopenia were the most frequent any-grade and grade 34 adverse events experiencedsr-agvhd is a condition characterized by an allogeneic hyperinflammatory response that can lead to organ damage and death 22 ruxolitinib was approved for sr-agvhd based on the results of the phase 2 reach1 trial 23 ruxolitinib 5 mg bid in combination with corticosteroids resulted in durable responses in this population of patients with poor prognosis proteomics analysis revealed robust changes in the expression of inflammatory mediators after treatment with ruxolitinib and corticosteroids with il-2receptor alpha among the most significantly downregulated proteins 24hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh is another disease with elevation of many pro-inflammatory cytokines eg ifn- il-2 il-6 il-10 il-18 ip-10 mip-1 and tnf- that frequently results in cytokine storm 2526 ruxolitinib 520 mg bid has demonstrated improvement in symptoms and inflammatory markers in the treatment of patients with hlh 26 27 28 in two consecutive patients treated with ruxolitinib rapid reduction in fever was observed 28 in a study of 34 patients with hlh the overall response rate was 735 with a complete response rate of 147 26 in the 25 patients who responded there was a significant reduction in the levels of ifn- il-18 mip-1 and ip-10 in another study of five patients with secondary hlh and two additional patients treated off-protocol 100 achieved a response at the time of the first assessment day 14 with three patients achieving a complete response 27 furthermore hematologic parameters including platelet red blood cell and neutrophil counts improved within the first week of ruxolitinib treatment all patients treated on-protocol also experienced substantial improvements in ferritin and soluble il-2 receptor concentrations at 15 mg bid ruxolitinib was generally well tolerated in this populationthe sudden surge in hospitalization of patients with covid-19 and the high mortality rate of hospitalized patients has encouraged treating physicians to look to repurpose approved drugs to lessen the burden of disease increased understanding of the immunopathology of severe covid-19 6 7 8 has led to the search for drugs that can be effective in controlling the rapid surge in cytokine levels cytokine storms can occur in several infectious and non-infectious sterile conditions and the mechanisms of cytokine storm are conserved irrespective of the triggering event patients with severe covid-19 have similar elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines as patients with hlh 25monoclonal antibodies targeting il-6 are likely to have an impact on the cytokine storm associated with covid-19 given that il-6 is among the cytokines reported to be elevated in those patients compared with healthy individuals at the time of writing antiil-6 antibody products tocilizumab and sarilumab are being evaluated in phase 3 studies 2930 however other cytokines such as il-2 il-7 il-10 ifn- g-csf and gm-csf are also elevated and may be equally or more important in the inflammatory response in patients with severe covid-19 as these cytokines signal through jak1 andor jak2 it is likely that treatment with ruxolitinib will result in broader anti-inflammatory activity than targeting any one of the cytokines alone fig 4
in addition to mf sr-agvhd and hlh noted above jak inhibitors have shown promise in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis and ulcerative colitis 31 ruxolitinib was the first jak inhibitor approved in the united states and european union indicated first for mf others have since been approved there are notable differences in selectivity profiles between approved jak inhibitors ruxolitinib is a balanced jak1jak2 inhibitor with good selectivity over non-janus kinases tofacitinib is a pan-jak inhibitor upadacitinib is a jak1 inhibitor and fedratinib is a jak2 inhibitor with activity against flt-kinase and other non-kinase proteins these differences result in distinct biomarker activity profiles singer et al determined gene signatures of four different jak inhibitors in a panel of 12 human primary cell systems and concluded that only ruxolitinib has a biomarker profile that is consistent with broad anti-inflammatory activity 32 these differences in selectivity may in turn be responsible for the differentiated safety profiles for example fedratinib shows a high incidence of gastrointestinal intolerance and cases of wernickes encephalopathy 33 whereas tofacitinib has been associated with an increased risk for lymphomas as well as cardiovascular events in patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor 34 non-melanoma skin cancers and elevated lipid parameters have occurred in patients treated with ruxolitinib 15 dose-dependent and reversible cytopenias have been commonly observed with ruxolitinib treatment in patients with mf pv and gvhd 1520213536 use of ruxolitinib has also been associated with viral reactivation including cytomegalovirus and herpes zoster virus 1535 suggesting the potential for an increase in infections with ruxolitinib treatmentthe pharmacokinetic profile of ruxolitinib is characterized by rapid oral absorption and a short terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 h fig 5a as well as a concentration-dependent and reversible pharmacodynamic effect fig 5b 37 this profile is in contrast with that of antibodies such as tocilizumab which has a half-life of approximately 2 weeks 38 and other jak inhibitors such as fedratinib which has a half-life of 6278 h 39 thus ruxolitinib is more conducive to short-term therapy and withdrawal as needed based on the similarity of the reported elevation of cytokine levels in covid-19 to hlh and mf dose ranges of 5 to 15 mg bid may result in adequate inhibition of cytokine signaling while minimizing adverse events furthermore it is anticipated that patients would receive ruxolitinib for approximately 14 days a brief time period that should minimize the risk of long-term infection or other complications such as severe cytopenias although preclinical models and clinical data show a lack of any impact on t-cell function and immune response with ruxolitinib treatment at pharmacologically relevant doses 171940 it would be prudent to both select patients who are likely to develop cytokine storm based on evolving clinical criteria such as h-score and to identify the best time to initiate treatment based on onset of symptoms and other clinical indicators such as respiratory distress or the need for supplemental oxygentaken together these data suggest that ruxolitinib at pharmacologically achievable doses may be able to mitigate the hyperinflammatory state observed in patients experiencing covid-19associated cytokine storm indeed early clinical evidence supports this premise a team in northern italy has reported on the use of ruxolitinib in four of their hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen with clinical improvement seen in all four patients 41 furthermore emerging data from ongoing investigator-initiated trials suggest a potential benefit of ruxolitinib with a manageable adverse event profile 42 43 44 45 in a randomized trial of 43 patients in wuhan china patients treated with ruxolitinib had a numerically shorter time to clinical improvement compared with those treated with standard of care median 12 vs 15 days and better outcome for survival 0 vs 3 deaths in the control arm 42 importantly although higher rates of grade 12 anemia and thrombocytopenia were observed with ruxolitinib in this study there was no increase in grade 34 cytopenias and patients receiving ruxolitinib experienced a significantly shorter time to improvement of lymphopenia compared with standard of care median 5 vs 8 days hazard ratio 3307 95 ci 1097 to 8409 p  033 additionally no increase in infections was seen with ruxolitinib treatment in these patientsthese encouraging early clinical results combined with a thorough understanding of the evidence supporting the posited mechanism of action of ruxolitinib in covid-19associated cytokine storm and the urgent need for treatments in patients with severe disease support expedited investigation of ruxolitinib for patients with covid-19 in phase 3 clinical trialsthis work was supported by incyte research institute incyte corporation wilmington de usa the authors as employees of the sponsor were

cellular redox homeostasis 1 as well as the guardian of healthspan and gatekeeper of species longevity 2 nrf2 regulates most of the genes that defend us against oxidative stress including superoxide dismutases catalase numerous peroxidases and glutathione metabolism as well as hundreds of genes involved in scores of important metabolic pathways 3 the individual vulnerabilities of various structural and catalytic gene products to damage or inactivation by reactive oxygen species ros may lead to degenerative diseases and metabolic dysfunctions importantly nrf2 declines with age 45 and contributes greatly to the frailty associated with aging 678 because nrf2 transcriptionally upregulates genes that combat oxidative stress its loss allows oxidative stress to go unmitigated and drive the aging phenotype 189 oxidative stress is therefore a common theme among the key features associated with the aging process collectively referred to as the hallmarks of aging as it disrupts proteostasis 10 alters genomic stability 11 alters susceptibility to viral and microbial infections 12 and leads to cell death it is this age-related frailty 8 that often defines the most vulnerable population in situations such as the one we currently face with the coronavirus pandemic 13numerous published studies have implicated nrf2 as a regulator of susceptibility to respiratory viral infections a recent review by lee 14 points out that virus-induced modulation of the host antioxidative response has turned out to be a crucial determinant for the progression of several viral diseases a virus needs to keep oxidative stress at a level optimal for viral reproduction which is higher than normal to support the viral metabolism but should not be so high as to kill off the host cell viruses have evolved mechanisms for manipulating the nrf2 pathway in both directions depending on the needs of the virus but importantly taking control away from the host cell among the types of viruses studied are influenza virus respiratory syncytial virus rsv and human metapneumovirus hmpv 1215161718 the phenomenon is also seen in non-respiratory viruses including dengue virus denv 19 rotavirus 20 herpes simplex virus 21 zika virus 22 and hiv 23 suggesting that regulation of oxidative stress may be a need common to most if not all viruses and that nrf2 activators may offer multiple ways to regain control of important pathways to increase resistance and slow viral replication we recently described a phytochemical composition pb125 that potently activates nrf2 by controlling multiple steps involved in the process especially via the akt1pi3kgsk3fyn pathway 24the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nrf2 activation via pb125 on human liver-derived hepg2 cells as well as on primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells hpaecs in culture the endothelial cell has been recently implicated as a major player in the tissue destruction caused by covid-19 varga et al performed post-mortem analyses of covid-19 patients finding involvement of endothelial cells across vascular beds of multiple organs including electron microscopic evidence of virus particles in renal endothelial cells 25 ackermann et al also documented virus particles inside the cells moreover they found the lungs of covid-19 patients had a distorted vascularity with structurally deformed capillaries that showed sudden changes in diameter and the presence of intussusceptive pillars that might be explained by drastically dysregulated angiogenesis 26 these findings broaden the focus of covid-19 from a disease of pulmonary epithelium to one of multi-organ vascular endothelium thus we measured the expression of genes known to be important for antiviral activity in general as well as genes with specific relevance to covid-19 such as ace2 and tmprss2 which determine whether cell types are susceptible to viral entry 27 hdac5 which helps maintain nrf2 in an activated state 28 plasminogen plg which is newly recognized as a regulator of cytokine signaling 29 and tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor pai-1 serpine1 which has recently been shown to play an important role in the inhibition of host proteases including tmprss2 responsible for influenza a virus maturation and spread 30 in addition a group of 36 cytokines expressed by endothelial cells was significantly downregulated suggesting that pb125 might be useful in attenuating the overexuberant production of cytokines known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm that characterizes a small group of hyperinflammatory conditions that includes graft-versus-host disease 31 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and covid-19 32plant extracts rosemary extract from rosmarinus

mean  standard error of the mean sem one-way anova with tukey multiple comparisons testing or students t test for unpaired data was performed using prism software version 60 graphpad software san diego ca usa statistical significance was set at p value  005using the elisa assay for il-6 we determined that pretreatment of hpaecs with pb125 decreased the lps-induced release of il-6 protein from the hpaecs in this study the hpaecs were plated as described above and then after 24 h they were treated with 5 gml of pb125 extract or with the corresponding amounts of vehicle control after an additional 16 h of incubation the cells were treated by adding 20 ng of lps or vehicle control per ml of medium each of the four treatment groups was run in triplicate after 5 h of lps treatment aliquots of cell culture medium were removed from each well for il-6 measurement by elisa lps stimulation of the vehicle-pretreated hpaecs greatly increased the release of il-6 protein into the culture media but this lps-induced il-6 release was reduced by 61 in the cells pretreated with pb125 p  00067 the results are shown in figure 1because sars-cov-2 entry into a human cell depends on expression of ace2 for binding and on tmprss2 for proteolytic activation of the spike protein 27 we examined the effects of pb125 on the expression of these two genes because inhibition of the protease activity of tmprss2 has been shown to block viral entry 27 we also examined the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 pai-1 encoded by the serpine1 gene a normal plasma component and known potent inhibitor of tmprss2 30 ace2 mrna was downregulated -35-fold and tmprss2 was downregulated -28-fold by pb125 in human liver-derived hepg2 cells as seen in figure 2 while these impediments may not completely block viral entry they may significantly impair it slowing the rate of viral progression furthermore pb125 strongly upregulated serpine1pai-1 by 178-fold pb125 downregulated hdac5 in human liver cells by -28-fold also shown in figure 2 in humans hdac5 appears to be responsible for the deacetylation and attenuation of nrf2 activity 28 the cytokine lif an important antiviral cellular response to viral infection 3839 was upregulated 66-fold by pb125 because of recent evidence that plasmin can trigger substantial proinflammatory release of cytokines 29 we examined the effect of pb125 on plasminogen plg mrna expression finding it to be downregulated by -19-fold thus all six of these gene regulatory effects of pb125 would appear to counter viral attempts to enter the cell andor to usurp control of oxidative stress responseto examine the effects of pb125 on genes that may contribute to the covid-19-induced cytokine storm we examined a model of lipopolysaccharide lps-treated hpaecs with and without treatment with pb125 the results are seen in figure 3 all 36 genes were significantly upregulated by lps in the absence of pb125 group 3 vs group 1 and normalized to 100 indicated by the red bar with percent suppression reflecting the decreased expression seen in group 4 lps  pb125 vs group 3 lps alone sixteen cytokines including two colony stimulating factors are shown in green with mrnas downregulated by pb125 as indicated the average percent inhibition for the group of cytokines was 70 two proinflammatory interleukins il-1b and il-6 showed mrnas inhibited 61 and 44 respectively three proinflammatory cytokine-induced adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule 1 icam1 vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 vcam1 and endothelial cell selectin sele were suppressed an average of 78 tumor necrosis factor tnf mrna was reduced by 33 but a group of five tnf-induced proteins tnfaips were repressed even more averaging 70 four other genes representing the tnf family were downregulated an average of 65 further a family of five interferon-inducible genes is shown to be downregulated an average of 63 this across-the-board reduction in genes that contribute to the cytokine storm is noteworthy as it is the intensity of this storm that predicts icu fatalities from covid-19 32 transforming this storm into a manageable shower is therefore a major therapeutic objective in the clinical management of covid-19 patientsthe last decade has seen more than 10000 publications on nrf2 and its involvement in redox homeostasis inflammation and immunity neurodegeneration aging and diseases associated with aging ischemia-reperfusion injury and many other areas but relatively little has been published regarding its roles in viral infectivity and resistance despite some rather tantalizing studies kesic et al showed that sirna knockdown of nrf2 expression in human nasal epithelial cells effectively decreased both nrf2 mrna and nrf2 protein expression in these cells which correlated with significantly increased entry of influenza abangkok179 h3n2 serotype and replication in the transduced human cells 12 importantly they also demonstrated that enhancing nrf2 activation via supplementation with sulforaphane sfn and epigallocatechin gallate egcg increased antiviral mediators in the absence of viral infection and also abrogated viral entry yegeta et al took a different approach and increased oxidative stress not just by manipulating nrf2 expression genetically but by alternatively exposing mice to an exogenous oxidative stresscigarette smoke 15 cigarette smoke-exposed nrf2-deficient mice showed higher rates of mortality than wild-type mice after influenza virus infection with enhanced peribronchial inflammation lung permeability damage and mucus hypersecretion cho et al 40 have similarly studied respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection the single most important virus causing acute respiratory tract infections in children they found that nrf2 mice infected with rsv showed significantly increased bronchopulmonary inflammation epithelial injury and mucus cell metaplasia as well as nasal epithelial injury when compared to similarly infected nrf2 wt mice the nrf2 mice also showed significantly attenuated viral clearance and ifn- and greater weight loss importantly pretreatment with oral sulforaphane significantly limited lung rsv replication and virus-induced inflammation in nrf2 wt mice komaravelli et al 161718 have noted that rsv not only causes increased production of ros but actively lowers expression of antioxidant enzymes by increasing the rate of proteasomal degradation of nrf2 at 6 h post-infection nrf2-dependent gene transcription was increased indicating that the cell is in control and responding to the insult of viral infection and the increase in oxidative stress by 15 h post-infection however the concentration of nrf2 had dropped significantly to about half its preinfection level reflecting a change-of-control to favor the virus to accomplish this rsv had increased nrf2 ubiquitination triggering its proteasomal degradation representing one example by which viruses subvert cellular antioxidant defenses taken together these studies demonstrate the ability of nrf2 to impede viral entry slow viral replication and reduce inflammation weight loss and mortality but without providing much detailed insight as to which genes and pathways are involvedthe first challenge facing a virus and particularly a virus that is jumping from one host species to another is gaining entry to the cell there are some fairly common ports of entry such as ldlr and icam1 that lead to endosomal entry and which are shared among various viral families 41 sars-cov-2 however seems to be largely if not totally restricted to a very specific mode of entry the unique mode of entry may be the greatest vulnerability for the virus opening the door to some potentially effective therapies substantial evidence suggests that a transmembrane protease encoded by the tmprss2 gene plays a critical role in the entry for sars and mers coronavirus for 2013 asian h7n9 influenza virus and for several h1n1-subtype influenza a virus infections 2742434445 suggesting that targeting tmprss2 could be a novel antiviral strategy to treat coronavirus 42 hoffmann and coworkers found that infection by sars-cov-2 the virus responsible for covid-19 may depend almost exclusively on the host cell factors ace2 and tmprss2 27 the spike s protein of coronaviruses facilitates viral entry into target cells entry depends on binding of the s protein to a cellular receptor ace2 which facilitates viral attachment to the surface of target cells in addition entry requires s protein priming by the cellular protease tmprss2 which entails s protein cleavage and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes figure 4 this priming can be blocked by clinically proven protease inhibitors of the tmprss2 camostat mesylate 2746 and nafamostat mesylate 47 nafamostat is remarkably potent with an ic50 in the nanomolar range for blocking cellular entry of mers-cov in vitro but has not been clinically tested as an antiviral in humans the drug appears not to be available at present in an oral formulation and because of its lack of specificity there is concern over possible side effects 47 it may prove suitable for treatment of severe covid-19 casestmprss2 can also be blocked by the human antiprotease plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 pai-1 34 as shown in figure 4 iwata-yoshikawa et al 43 found that knockout of tmprss2 improved both pathology and immunopathology in the bronchi andor alveoli after infection of the mice by sars-cov and completely prevented loss of body weight this is especially noteworthy in sars-cov infection where tmprss2 is not the sole mechanism for entry as is the case with sars-cov-2 thus our data showing that pb125 downregulated ace2 by -35-fold downregulated tmprss2 by -28-fold and upregulated pai-1 the potent tmprss2 inhibitor by 178-fold figure 2 strongly suggest that pb125 treatment might diminish the ability of sars-cov-2 to bind to a host cell and to obtain spike protein activation as a result of less ace2 and tmprss2 on the cell surface and as a result of a 178-fold increase in plasma pai-1 which would inhibit the remaining tmprss2 dittmann et al 30 have found that influenza a virus iav infection provokes a host response that is both necessary and sufficient for viral inhibitionincreased production of pai-1 they found that for iav proteolytic cleavage of the viral coat protein hemagglutinin by host proteases such as plasmin or tmprss2 was a requirement for maturation and infectivity of progeny particles addition of recombinant pai to the apical side of haec significantly reduced iav growth compared to carrier control with about 90 inhibition of infectivity at 48 h post-infection in contrast addition of -pai-1 antibody dramatically enhanced iav growth thus many viruses rely on both host endo- and exo-proteases for various entry and maturation functions moreover they found that tmprss2 necessary for sars-cov-2 infection is among the trypsin-like proteases effectively inhibited by pai-1 30a recent publication by kumar et al 48 has used computer modeling to predict that withaferin a and withanone present in extracts of the ayurvedic plant ashwagandha withania somnifera stably interact at the catalytic site of tmprss2 mimicking the pharmaceutical inhibitor camostat mesylate 274648 in addition kumar et al found that withanone downregulated the tmprss2 gene similarly to what we report here with pb125 figure 2 ashwagandha is one of the three components of pb125 so there is a probability that pb125 may both inhibit the enzymatic activity of tmprss2 as well as downregulating the expression of its mrnaquite apart from direct involvement with viral entry mechanisms pb125 downregulates hdac5 in human liver-derived hepg2 cells by -28-fold also shown in figure 2 acetylation of nrf2 increases binding of nrf2 to its cognate response element in a target gene promoter and increases nrf2-dependent transcription of target genes 49 in humans hdac5 appears to be the isozyme responsible for the deacetylation and attenuation of nrf2 activity 28 and is likely the gene upregulated by rsv infection described above by komaravelli et al 18 thus pb125 by inhibiting the deacetylation and subsequent degradation of nrf2 maintains more active acetylated nrf2 in the nucleus for a longer time counteracting one of the mechanisms enumerated above by which viruses attempt to commandeer control of the cells redox status and indirectly amplifying all nrf2-dependent actionsthe upregulation of the cytokine lif an important antiviral cellular response to viral infection is shown to be strongly upregulated by pb125 in figure 2 again countering potential attempts by a virus to downregulate it lif gene expression was downregulated by h7n9 infection and knock-down of lif increased virus titers for three influenza a strains investigated indicating an important role of lif in virus defense 39 in vivo studies were performed with lif knockout mice that were infected with rsv lif knockout mice yielded higher virus titers compared to control mice and lif signaling was shown to be critical for the protection of the lung from injury during 38while we have discussed the role of pai-1 in preventing tmprss2 from activating the sars-cov-2 spike protein mention should also be made of what many would consider its real job the blocking of the conversion of plasminogen encoded by the plg gene to plasmin by both urokinase-type plasminogen activator upa and tissue plasminogen activator tpa fibrinolysis was the first recognized function for plasmin so one might expect that high expression of pai-1 would cause low plasmin levels which might be a risk factor for venous thrombosis genetic plasminogen deficiency however is not strongly associated with risk of thrombosis 50 in a study of 23 subjects with homozygous mutations in the plg gene and little or no detectable plasmin 96 had clinical inflammation of the conjunctivae ligneous conjunctivitis but 0 had experienced venous thrombosis 51 new roles however have been recognized for plasmin regarding cytokine release 2931525354 a cytokine storm syndrome is a form of systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by a variety of factors such as severe infections it occurs when large numbers of leukocytes are activated and release inflammatory cytokines which in turn activate yet more leukocytes sato et al found that pharmacological inhibition of plasmin significantly prevented mortality in a mouse model of acute graft-versus-host disease proposing that plasmin inhibition could offer a novel therapeutic strategy to control the deadly cytokine storm that results from graft-versus-host disease preventing tissue destruction 31 macrophage activation syndrome mas is a life-threatening disorder characterized by a cytokine storm and multi-organ dysfunction due to excessive immune activation in a mouse model of mas shimazu et al saw a similar prevention in lethality concluding that plasmin regulates the influx of inflammatory cells and the production of inflammatory cytokineschemokines 29 plasminogen has also been implicated in activation of astrocytes to produce an array of proinflammatory cytokines 54 in figure 2 we report that pb125 downregulates plasminogen mrna by -19-fold in liver cells thus in vivo we speculate that the combined downregulation of plasminogen and 178-fold increase in pai-1 which covalently reacts with and deactivates both tissue- and urokinase-type plasminogen activators may significantly attenuate the plasmin-induced cytokine storm phenomenonhyperinflammation in covid-19 is associated with such an elevation of proinflammatory cytokines interleukins and tumor necrosis factor- tnf and a large number of tnf-induced proteins and granulocyte colony stimulating factor gcsf or csf3 among 41 hospitalized covid-19 patients in wuhan china all had elevated il-1b ip10cxcl10 and mcp1ccl2 sixteen of the patients were subsequently admitted to the icu and had even higher plasma levels of gcsfcsf3 ip10cxcl10 mcp1ccl2 mip1accl3 and tnf- and the intensity of the cytokine storm was a strong prognosticator of mortality 55 all of these genes encoding these covid-19-related cytokines appear in figure 3 as they were significantly upregulated by lps-treated hpaecs and significantly downregulated by pb125 treatment importantly a growing number of studies conclude that cytokine storm syndrome is the direct cause of death in most covid-19 fatalities 55565758we speculate that the well-documented age-related loss of nrf2 expression 45 is a potential contributor to the occurrence of a cytokine storm a longitudinal study of 40 confirmed covid-19 patients 59 showed that the 13 severe cases compared to the 27 milder cases were older mean age 597 vs 432 had significantly elevated c-reactive protein mean 629 vs 76 mgl and showed consistently higher neutrophil counts and lower lymphocyte counts throughout the two week observation period these observations 5559 document a clear predilection for severity of covid-19 infection directly associated with age and intensity of inflammatory response and presumably inversely associated with nrf2 expression 8 the production and self-amplifying nature of an acute inflammatory response demands a prompt subsequent survival response from the host tissue to break the self-sustaining attraction of neutrophils to inflamed tissues we propose that it is a robust oxidative stress-induced activation of nrf2 in young healthy individuals that follows the gathering storm and rescues host tissues from irretrievable self-inflicted damage in older individuals or in the presence of comorbidities that may involve chronic inflammation the nrf2-activation response may be insufficient to break the self-perpetuating cycle of events figure 5 illustrates this proposed sequence of events we propose that activating a larger fraction of the limited nrf2 available in the elderly or otherwise compromised patients might allow them like their younger counterparts to shut down cytokine production to stop the escalating cytokine storm and to begin the recovery and repair phase of the inflammatory episode this activation boost to suboptimal levels of nrf2 can be provided by several pharmacological agents and as well or better by a number of phytochemical activators as we show here with pb125it is worth noting that the longitudinal study of covid-19 patients 59 reported a remarkably higher concentration of serum ferritin in the severe cases averaging 8355 gl with a range of 6354 to 15388 versus the milder cases averaging 3678 gl with a range of 1747 to 5220 ferritin has long been recognized as a source of iron released under inflammatory conditions by the superoxide radical 60616263 under the intense oxidative stress precipitated by a cytokine storm the release of iron would catalyze lipid peroxidation and greatly amplify host tissue injury covid-19 has already been added to the short list of known hyperferritinemic diseasesall of which are characterized by high serum ferritin and life-threatening hyperinflammation sustained by a cytokine storm which eventually leads to multi-organ failure 64 ferroptosis is a newly described form of regulated cell death that is iron dependent and causes cell death by mitochondrial dysfunction and toxic lipid peroxidation nrf2 has been implicated as a key deterministic component modulating the onset and outcomes of ferroptotic stress 65we studied three different phenomena that may be involved in vulnerability to the sars-cov-2 and these interactive phenomena are not all present in any single cell type the first objective to study the effects of pb125 on expression of ace2 and tmprss2 could be studied in presumed point-of-entry cells including alveolar type ii cells 27 and hpaecs 2526 there are both clinical and laboratory suggestions that the virus may invade many organs containing cell types that co-express ace2 and tmprss2 heart gut kidney eye including liver where we showed downregulation of both ace2 and tmprss2 thus liver is also a relevant cell in which to study these entry genes a second objective was to examine whether pb125 could limit systemic plasmin activity by downregulation of plg andor upregulation of pai-1 both plasma proteins not produced by the cells of the lung in this case the liver is the source of plasminogen and is the appropriate cell type to examine the source of pai-1 in plasma is not known but may be liver or muscle for the third objective of whether pb125 could downregulate the cytokines identified as participating in the cytokine storm phenomenon we believe the focus on primary hpaecs is appropriate although a more complete picture would include study of the inflammatory cell types themselves hpaecs generate the 36 cytokines we examined sounding the systemic alarm that recruits inflammatory cells to the infected organ the type ii alveolar cell has very little capacity for producing cytokines 66 for studying how an intervention can break the inflammatory cycle leading to a cytokine storm we believe that vascular endothelial cells may be the single most important players a potential limitation of the study is the use of lps as a surrogate for sars-cov-2 to induce the inflammatory responsewe propose that one evolutionary driving force for the nrf2 pathway may have been to provide a failsafe brake for out-of-control inflammatory events the increase in oxidative stress at the site of an intense inflammatory locus may have been the intended trigger for a system to activate nrf2 allowing it to end the assault at a point where the invader has likely been vanquished but from which the host may be able to survive in fact the cadre of genes induced by nrf2 has long been referred to as survival genes 3we have shown that a group of 42 genes linked to respiratory virus infectivity and resistance or to the associated immune response are responsive to pharmacological nrf2 activation it seems possible that the sum total of these multiple antiviral effects may confer a degree of resistance attenuate viral replication rate alleviate symptoms by limiting microvascular injury and perhaps allow successful navigation through the cytokine storm that is a particular problem with covid-19 even though the never-ending evolutionary war of wits continues and the viruses occasionally win a battle this scenario of the complex and multi-faceted antiviral mechanisms regulated by nrf2 serves to underscore the importance of this very central transcription factor in keeping us protected and functionaluntil the sars outbreak 2002 during which coronaviruses cov showcased their potential for epidemic spread and significant pathogenicity in humans they were mainly known as causes of mild respiratory and gastrointestinal disease 1 over the last two decades three novel betacoronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov and sars-cov2 have crossed the species barrier and caused significant outbreaks characterized by high case-fatality rates in humans 2 3 4  the latest addition to human pathogenic coronaviruses hcovs is sars-cov2 the cause of covid-19 at the time of submission of this review sars-cov2 has infected over 26 million people worldwide and claimed 185000 lives threatening many more httpsgisanddatamapsarcgiscomappsopsdashboardindexhtmlbda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 in the following epidemiological and clinical features of covid-19 pathophysiological mechanisms and already available and future therapeutic options will be discussed based on limited evidence available and extrapolation from related viral diseasethe first hcovs were described in 1966 e229-cov and oc43-cov 56 they are part of a group of currently four known seasonal hcovs shcov that also includes hku1-cov and nl63-cov which were only discovered in 2005 78 all shcovs are globally endemic and frequently cause common colds accounting for 2-18 of all respiratory tract infections 9 10 11 12 13 by their fourth birthday 75 of children show antibodies directed against at least one of the shcovs 1415 anti-shcovs antibodies provide some cross-immunity and antibody-mediated protection against infection by other species within the group 16 while their overall pathogenic potential is comparatively low in the immunocompromised infants the elderly and those with pre-existing pulmonary disorders shcovs can cause severe respiratory or sepsis-like presentations 17 18 19 20 21 oc43 displays some neurotropism and can cause demyelination and cns infections in vulnerable patient groups 2223 while estimates of their contribution to annual respiratory illness vary shcovs remain asymptomatic in approximately 50 of cases 24 25 26this is in stark contrast to the clinical presentation encountered in infections with so-called novel coronaviruses sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov2 which are associated with morbidity and case-fatality ratios that far exceed the ones in shcovsthe sars pandemic of 20023 originated in foshan guangdong province china and spread to south east asia europe and north america 27 containment was declared by the end of 2003 with no re-emergence reported since overall 8096 probable cases caused 774 deaths resulting in a mortality rate of 96 httpswwwwhointcsrsarsen mortality strongly correlated with age approaching 7 for those younger and 55 for those older than 60 years 28 health care workers in contact with sars patients demonstrated a very low seroconversion rate of 2 in asymptomatic individuals less than 5 of all affected were children and post-containment seroprevalence among children considered high-risk for significant exposure was extremely low this suggests that subclinical sars among children had not occurred 29 30 31 approximately 20 of sars patients required intensive care support for acute respiratory distress syndrome ards half of who died within the following 28 days 32the severe clinical phenotype of sars was replicated during the emergence of mers in 2012 which continues to circulate albeit to a lesser extent 36 to date 2494 cases of mers have occurred worldwide presenting as severe pneumonia and resulting in respiratory and multiorgan failure with a case-fatality-ratio of 35-45 37 individuals with comorbidities males and the immunocompromised are considered at particularly high riskin both previous novel coronavirus outbreaks the severity of the clinical manifestation has puzzled clinicians common features included massive inflammatory cell infiltration of the lungs resulting in acute lung injury ali and ards highly elevated inflammatory markers in the serum evidence of monocytemacrophage activation activated coagulation and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine profiles 33 34 35 36 37 38 this soon led to the implication of the host response as an important factor in this fulminant disease process 38 animal models of sars suggest that lung inflammation intensifies after viral clearance peaking as late as 14 days after infection 39 and similar observations were made in human sars patients this suggests that clinical deterioration later in the disease course was likely not due to uncontrolled viral replication but rather uncontrolled immune responses and associated damage 4041similar descriptions of clinical presentations in covid-19 are now emerging presenting features of cough and fever subacutely progress to respiratory distress and acute respiratory distress sydrome ards in 8-19 of patients with the elderly and those with underlying comorbidities especially cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus chronic pulmonary disorders or renal disease especially at risk httpswwwepicentroissitcoronavirusbollettinoreport-covid-201924marzoengpdf 42 43 44 45 it is estimated that about 14 of covid-19 patients develop respiratory symptoms requiring supplemental oxygen and approximately 5 develop a need for mechanical ventilation 44 45 46 the cdc reports an overall case-fatality rate of 23 though higher at 148 in patients over 80 years of age and 49 among the critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation 46the pulmonary pathology in covid-19 is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage and focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration and evidence of intravascular thrombosis monocytes macrophages and lymphocytes infiltrate the pulmonary interstitium 4748 the severe pulmonary inflammatory infiltrate of pulmonary tissue impedes alveolar gas exchange in addition one fifth of hospitalized patients develop significant cardiovascular morbidity characterized by troponin rise tachyarrhythmias and thromboembolic events which is strongly associated with mortality risk 49 50 51 common features of covid-19 patients requiring hospitalization and intensive care level support therefore are severe pneumonia with hypoxic respiratory failure of subacute onset evolving into ards with a clinical picture characterized by fevers lymphopenia highly elevated c-reactive protein proinflammatory cytokines serum ferritin and d-dimers histopathological evidence of a prominent pulmonary infitrate dominated by monocytes and macrophages vasculitis and hypercoagulability is seen 5253based on current knowledge clinical pictures disease pathology and progression of sars-cov2 infections are similar causing significant morbidity and mortality that may be associated with hyperinflammatory responses in a subset of patientscoronaviruses are highly prevalent animal pathogens with a wide host range overall thousands of species of coronaviruses are known 5455 currently seven covs are recognized as human pathogens 1 the family of coronaviridae is divided into two subfamilies coronavirinae and torovirinae coronavirinae include the genera alpha- betacoronaviruses infecting only mammals and gamma- and deltacoronaviruses which infect both mammals and birds human covs e229 and nl63 are human pathogenic alpha- while oc43 and hku1 and all novel covs including sars-cov2 are betacoronaviruses the potential of toroviruses to cause disease is humans is unknown httpstalkictvonlineorgictv-reportsictv9threportpositive-sense-rna-viruses-2011wposrnaviruses222coronaviridae coronaviruses covs are large enveloped viruses with a single-stranded nonsegmented positive sense rna genome that spans approximately 30 kilobases making it the largest known genome of any rna virus 56 being rna viruses covs readily evolve by mutation and homologous and non-homologous recombination which expands their host range and facilitates crossing of species barriers extensive animal reservoirs especially among bats genetic recombination among covs and their plasticity in terms of receptor use renders covs highly effective at host switching sometimes across wide taxonomic distances 5758all hcovs are thought to be zoonoses novel coronaviruses sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov2 are comparatively poorly adapted to humans which affects their pathogenic potential 5559 their genomic proximity to animal covs may allow for ongoing interspecies recombination events as observed in mers 60 mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov2 have a natural reservoir in bats infection of humans likely occurred through intermediate hosts including dromedary camels mers the masked palm civet sars and the pangolin sars-cov2 61 as wild palm civets do not carry sars-cov it must be assumed that the proximity of animals in markets facilitates recombination events and the emergence of novel viruses that may be pathogenic in humans 6263coronaviruses are spherical in shape their most prominent feature are club-like projections on the virus surface which are referred to as spikes the virus membrane contains four structural components the spike s envelope e membrane m and nucelocapsid n protein 56 fig 1
 for sars-cov and sars-cov2 the s protein is the primary determinant for host tropism and pathogenicity it is the main target for neutralizing antibodies and therefore of great interest in terms of immunological response and vaccine design 64 the spike structure is formed by homotrimers of s-glycoproteins each of which consists of two subunits whereby s1 forms the part involved in receptor recognition and s2 is highly conserved anchors the protein in the viral membrane and facilitates viral fusion 65 66 67 s1 contains a hypervariable loop which differs greatly between betacoronaviruses on both size and sequence viral entry requires the proteolysis of the s protein in two locations a process that utilizes host proteases and results in irreversible conformational changes of the s protein 6467 some anti-sars-cov antibodies in humans mimic receptor engagement thus modeling conformational s protein changes upon antigen-antibody interaction 67 the amino acid sequence of receptor binding sites of sars-cov2 is 74 homologous to that of sars- cov suggesting similar or even identical cell entry mechanisms for both viruses 68nl63 sars-cov and sars-cov2 all use the transmembrane angiotensin converting enzyme ace2 as host receptor whereas mers cov utilizes dipetidylpeptidase-4 dpp4 65 both receptors are transmembrane ectoenzymes that are highly conserved among mammals thus facilitating interspecies transfer however their enzymatic activity in itself is not necessary for successful binding and fusion 69 70 71binding affinity of the s protein of sars-cov2 and ace2 is high high sequence and conformational conservation of the s protein observed across sars-cov2 and sars-cov allows for some level of cross neutralization of the two viruses in vitro 6468hemagglutinin residues enhance binding by allowing interactions with sialic acid residues on host cell surfaces betacoronaviruses feature yet another structural protein hemagglutinin-esterase he which binds sialic acid on cell surfaces 72 fig 1 this may enhance the virus ability to bind and invade host cell surfaces and may constitute a virulence factor in novel hcovswhile data on sars-cov2 are still sparse aforementioned parallels with sars-cov and mers-cov may for now allow extrapolation of knowledge to understand how sars-cov2 escapes the hosts immune response notably sars-cov2 shares almost 80 rna sequence homology with sars-cov and 50 with mers-cov 75 with sars-cov2 exhibiting additional genomic regions when compared to sars-cov in particular the viral spike protein which binds to the host cell receptor is 20-30 amino acids longer than sars-cov and other closely related coronaviruses 75 thus it is possible even likely that sars-cov2 uses similar immune evasion strategies to other coronaviruses but additional as yet undiscovered mechanisms may also be utilized by sars-cov2 76as mentioned above sars-cov and sars-cov2 both use ace2 as their host cell receptor to establish infection fig 2a 77 ace2 is expressed in almost all organs in the body ace2 has been shown to be highly expressed on surfactant producing type 2 alveolar cells and on ciliated and goblet cells in the airways these cells likely provide a portal of entry for the virus in humans 78 79 80 high ace2 expression is also observed on the intestinal epithelium 81 furthermore ace2 is expressed on cardiac cells and vascular endothelia which may explain cardiovascular complications in some patients 53 for sars-cov infection of immune cells including monocytesmacrophages and t cells has been observed it is not clear to date whether and to what extent sars-cov-2 can also infect these cell types ace2 is also but at lower levels and not ubiquitously expressed on monocytes and macrophages so this may also provide an entry mechanism into immune cells for sars-cov-2 however other receptors andor phagocytosis of virus containing immune complexes may also be involved fig 1b 768283the host response and clearance of viral infections heavily relies on type i interferon t1ifn expression 84 expression of t1ifn and down-stream signals modulate cell responses and reprogram cells into an anti-viral state subsequently promoting infection control and pathogen clearance 85 as a first step immune cells sense viral infection through identification of virus derived pattern associated molecular patterns pamps such as viral rna these bind to and activate pattern recognition receptors prrs inon immune cells and result in immune cell activation fig 2 rnas viruses such as sars-cov sars-cov2 and mers-cov are detected by endosomal rna prrs including toll-like receptors tlr-3 and 7 andor cytoplasmic rna sensors namely retinoic acid-inducible gene i rig-i and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 mda5 fig 2 usually tlr37 activation results in nuclear translocation of the transcription factors nfb and irf3 while rig-1mda5 activation result in activation of irf3 in turn this triggers increased expression of t1ifn through irf3 and other innate pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 tnf- through nfb 7686 in this context t1ifn and other innate pro-inflammatory cytokines promote their own expression through auto-amplification t1ifn activate the ifn- receptor complex ifnar which results in the phosphorylationactivation of stat family transcription factors 1 and 2 fig 2 while il-1 il-6 and tnf receptor activation feeds into pro-inflammatory cytokine expression though the transcription factor nfb fig 2 85 86 87 activation and priming of innate and adaptive immune responses should result in pathogen clearance and recoveryhowever in a proportion of infected individuals sars-cov mers-cov and likely sars-cov2 evade immune system recognition through suppression of these mechanisms a phenomenon associated with more severe disease and poorer prognosis 388889fig 2 red symbols sars-cov has been shown to alter ubiquitination and degradation of rna sensors rig-i and mda5 it inhibits activation of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein mavs which are essential for the activation and nuclear translocation of irf3 in response to cytoplasmic rna sensor activation furthermore sars-cov and likely sars-cov2 inhibit the tnf receptor-associated factors traf 3 and 6 which are central for the induction of irf-37 in response to tlr37 andor rig-i and mda-5 ligation as well as nfb signalling pathways which are usually activated in response to tlr37 ligation or cytokine receptor signaling 88 lastly novel coronaviruses can counteract t1ifn signaling through inhibition of stat family transcription factor phosphorylation 86 taken together suppression of innate immune mechanisms in infected epithelial cells and to some extent infected monocytesmacrophages allow novel coronaviruses to proliferate without triggering the innate anti-viral response machinery of these cellshowever at a later stage infected cells undergo cell death and release virus particles together with intracellular components that trigger innate inflammatory mechanisms through their recognition by prrs inon innate immune cells as a result of this innate immune activation and resultant expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-1 il-6 tnf- etc adaptive immune cells become involved in the hosts defense against viral infections t lymphocytes play a central role in this anti-viral response including cd4 t cell derived cytokines cd8 t cell mediated cytotoxicity and b cell activation resulting in antibody production novel coronaviruses may also partially escape these mechanisms through the induction of t cell apoptosis 90 however lymphocytes may also become depleted due to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by not infected innate immune cells that become recruited to the lungs and trigger hyper-inflammation seen during the development of a cytokine storm 91while symptoms of covid-19 disease may be sometimes only slightly milder in comparison to infections with sars-cov or mers-cov several key pathogen-associated and clinical features of disease are similar and we can extrapolate knowledge from what is already known about the pathophysiology of sars and mers in covid-19 as in sars or mers several key findings were associated with poor outcomes in cohort studies and suggest hyper-inflammation may be linked to more severe disease three early studies from wuhan linked cytopenia andor significantly elevated inflammatory parameters with severe disease and unfavorable outcomes one study involving 99 patients reported neutrophilia 38 lymphopenia 35 and increased systemic inflammatory proteins il-6 in 52 and crp in 84 as common symptoms in covid-19 disease 72 another study involving 41 individuals linked severe disease culminating in icu admission and mortality with neutrophilia and lymphopenia 4 the third study reported significant leukopenia 118 lymphopenia 776 thrombopenia 412 anemia 482 hypofibrinogenemia 224 and hypo-albuminemia 788 in a cohort of 85 patients who died from covid-19 8392 these observations are in line with findings in severe or lethal cases of sars and mers in which increased numbers of neutrophils and monocytesmacrophages are present in the airways 8393 other groups reported severe clinical phenotypes and icu dependency of patients to be associated with increased plasma levels of innate chemokines specifically c-x-c motif chemokine 10 cxcl10interferon gamma-induced protein 10 ip-10 chemokine c-c motif ligand 2 ccl2monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein mip-1accl3 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf- 2 this indeed is similar to the situation reported in sars and mers in which uncontrolled inflammation centrally contributes to poor outcomes 94 95 96though seemingly contradictory to mechanisms of immune evasion discussed above enhanced innate immune activation including increased t1ifn il-1 il-6 and tnf- expression centrally contributes to morbidity and mortality in covid-19 mers and sars one possible explanation is the induction of endothelial and vascular cell damage and cell death as a result of viral replication virus-induced inflammatory cell death including necrosis or pyroptosis result in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression uninfected immune cell recruitment and activation 97 mice infected with sars-cov exhibit excessive t1ifn secretion from myeloid cells in infected tissues indeed immune evasion through the suppression of anti-viral responses and t1ifn expression in respiratory epithelia results in high viral loads 38 from this it is hypothesized that not infected monocytesmacrophages and neutrophils recruited to the site of infection exhibit strong and poorly controlled inflammatory responses resulting in tissue damage and systemic inflammation both of which contribute to morbidity and mortality 53fig 3
another factor thought to contribute to organ damage and poor outcomes is the early production of neutralizing antibodies against coronaviruses antibody-dependent enhancement ade is a phenomenon shown to contribute to damage accrual during viral infections it has been shown to promote cellular uptake of virus particles bound in immune complexes through their binding to fc receptors fcr this may contribute to aforementioned persistent viral replication in immune cells including newly infected antigen-presenting cells but also immune complex mediated inflammatory responses fig 2 fig 3 fig 4
 that contribute to tissue and organ damage including acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 98 99 100 indeed a subset of covid-19 patients reportedly develop vasculitic lesions blood vessel occlusion and infarctions histopathologic reports from tissue sections suggests features associated with immune complex mediated vasculitis including infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes within and around blood vessels wall thickening and focal hemorrhage 53101 102 103as is true for a number of systemic autoimmuneinflammatory conditions uncontrolled activation of immune responses is likely not limited to the innate mechanisms as a result of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and the presence of nuclear antigens from cell and tissue damage adaptive immune cells may become activated and trigger a second wave of inflammation potentially in those patients who deteriorate after 7-10 days of infection indeed adaptive immune cells namely t lymphocytes which are observed in lung tissue sections of covid-19 patients with ards andor cytokine storm may drive inflammation at later disease stages similar mechanisms have been reported in influenza and other viral infections 104105 overall severely ill covid-19 patients experiencing cytokine storm exhibit lymphopenia and sometimes atrophy of the lymphatic tissues namely lymph nodes and spleen 51106107 this is in line with reports in primary and secondary forms of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh and associated cytokine storm which result in inflammatory cell death and hypo-cellularity of lymphatic organs 108 109 110poor outcomes are associated with age indeed children appear to contract sars-cov2 and usually do not develop severe symptoms or complications this is surprising as children are prone to viral infections including severe manifestations more than 75 of children get exposed to seasonal coronaviruses before their 4th birthday and seroconverts however antibody titres wane over time most obvious in those over 60 years 110 this may reduce immune response to sars-cov2 in the elderly as limited cross-reactivity between anti-seasonal coronavirus and anti-sars antibodies exists but also contribute to increased inflammation and complications immunological recall effects exist as anti-seasonal coronavirus titres increase in sera of convalescent sars patients 111 which may influence immune pathology as mentioned above antibody-bound virions can enter susceptible cells such as macrophages through fc receptor ligation in a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement ade 112 in other viral infections eg dengue fever ade allows immune cell infection and reduces type i ifn dependent antiviral responses while promoting pro-inflammatory il-6 and tnf- expression 113114 furthermore massive recall antibody production in individuals with a history of exposure to seasonal coronaviruses but waning titres such as the elderly can result in immune complex deposition and promote inflammation and damage including immune complex vasculitis 110another age-dependent disease mechanism may be associated with live vaccinations eg measles or bcg vaccines protect beyond their target antigen through induction of innate immune mechanisms termed non-specific heterologous effects individuals who received bcg vaccination produce increased levels of pro-inflammatory il-1 and tnf- in response to s aureus or candida spp and bcg vaccinated infants exhibit reduced infection-related mortality 115 however heterologous immune responses to unrelated antigens may also contrite to inflammation-related complications frequently adults exhibit memory t cells that are specific to antigens they were never exposed to and cross-reactive memory t cells can narrow the t cell response by favoring high affinity clones indeed limited memory t cell repertoires are a feature of immune senescence and associated with disease progression and t cell mediated damage in other viral infections such as virus hepatitis and infective mononucleosis 116as mentioned above ace2 acts as transmembrane cellular receptor for sars-cov2 allowing cell infection 117 variable ace2 expression patterns affect disease susceptibility between tissues eg respiratory epithelia vs immune cells but potentially also between individuals men vs women children vs adults thereby determining disease progression and outcomes recently it has been suggested that ace2 expression is highest in children and young women that its expression decreases with age and is lowest in individuals with chronic disease including diabetes and hypertension inversely correlating with risk for severe disease and unfavorable outcomes 118 while ace2 facilitates viral entry into cells it also plays a role in controlling infection and inflammation ace2 is part of the ace2angiotensin- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7mas system as it counteracts the pro-inflammatory effects of the angiotensin-2 it catalyzes angiotensin-2 processing into angiotensin-1-7 which counteracts vasoconstriction modulates leukocyte migration cytokine expression and fibrogenic pathways 119 thus ace2 contributes to limiting tissue inflammation while favoring repair mechanisms furthermore high ace2 expression may be of benefit as sars-cov2 virus particles may compete with angiotensin-2 for cell surface binding sites and cellular uptake thus relatively increased ace2 expression may explain why children and young adults especially young women are relatively protected from covid19 and associated complicationstaken together novel coronaviruses such as sars-cov2 may effectively suppress early t1ifn responses which contributes to uncontrolled virus replication resulting in delayed and potentially increased cytokine responses at later stages early and sufficient control of virus replication and pathogen clearance may be altered in individuals at risk such as the elderly patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome etc 7475 healthy children and young people on the other hand may effectively control viral load at early stages of infection and less frequently develop severe disease and life-threatening complications lastly early antibody production may result in integration of viable virus into immune cells and increased viral replication resulting in immune complex mediated pathology which may contribute to pathology in young patients with no obvious risk factors 100medical use of chloroquine dates back decades its phosphate and sulphate derivatives are administered as antimalarials and hydroxychloroquine is widely used as immunomodulatory agent in systemic lupus erythematosus in addition chloroquine has antiviral activity against influenza chikungunya virus seasonal covs and sars 120 121 122 123 as for these viruses cell entry and replication of sars-cov2 depends on ph-dependent internalization by endocytosis and lysosomal fusion fig 2 itself being a weak base hydroxychloroquine follows the cellular ph gradient and accumulates in the acid environment of endolysosomes and other acidic cell organelles thereby alkalinizing endosomes in addition hydroxychloroquine interferes with the terminal glycosylation of ace2 interfering with virus binding 123antiviral activity of chloroquine derivatives against sars-cov2 was identified in vitro early on 124 based on this the drug was rapidly introduced into clinical use and preliminary reports suggested improved viral clearance and clinical outcomes in covid-19 patients receiving a 10-days course of hydroxychloroquine 125 a small french pilot study randomizing 36 patients with covid-19 suggested accelerated viral clearance in patients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin 126 however others have challenged results and found no benefit in either disease outcome or viral clearance 127  disappointingly the largest also retrospective study to date assessing hydroxychloroquine on its own or in combination with azithromycin found no benefit but indeed an increased mortality risk among patients receiving hydroxychloroquine 128 a study exploring chloroquine diphosphate in two dosing regimens was forced to terminate early for concerns over increased mortality in the high dose arm the authors conclude that treatment with high dose chloroquine for 10 days is not sufficiently safe and should no longer be used in severe sars-cov2 patients 129immunomodulatory effects of hydroxychloroquine are well established and may enhance its therapeutic effect in covid-19 complicated by macrophage activation and cytokine storm 130 alkalization of endosomes reduces proteolysis chemotaxis phagocytosis receptor recycling and interferes with processing of epitopes displayed by antigen-presenting cells 131 this overall contributes to decreased production of il-1 il-6 and prostaglandins and alters intracellular calcium and tlr dependent signaling furthermore preventing the acidification of lysosomes hydroxychloroquine impairs cellular autophagy a critical step for innate and adaptive immunity activation 132 finally hydroxychloroquine has antithrombotic effects which may be beneficial in covid-19 where inflammatory stimuli and endothelial injury activate coagulation and promote micro-thrombus formation 133134while generally deemed safe when administered at correct dosing and under close monitoring the therapeutic range of chloroquine and its derivatives is narrow side effects include conduction defects cardiomyopathy retinopathy and hypoglycemia 135136as mentioned above synergistic effects of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine against sars-cov2 have been observed in vitro which appeared to translate into clinical practice 126137138 interestingly azithromycin is also a weak base and also accumulates in endosomes with an alkalinizing effect at least equivalent to hydroxychloroquine in addition to its antimicrobial properties azithromycin is sometimes used for its immunomodulatory properties especially in patients with chronic pulmonary disorders azithromycin polarizes macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory m2 phenotype and inhibits pro-inflammatory stat1 and nfb signaling pathways 139140 in the context of anti-inflammatory effects it is of particular interest that azithromycin is used in patients requiring intensive care for non-covid-19 related ards and is associated with a significant reduction in mortality and shorter time to extubation 141 142 143adverse cardiac effects and proarrhythmogenic properties of hydroxychloroquine especially in combination with macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin deserves particular mention 144 hydroxychloroquine azithromycin and to a lesser extent lopinavir have been associated with prolongation of the qtc interval and increase the risk for tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death careful consideration of patient risk profile pre-treatment ecg assessment and monitoring of pharmacokinetics fluid and electrolyte status and polypharmacy are essential for the management of critically ill covid 19 patients 145nucleoside analogues are explored as treatment options for covid-19 candidates include favipiravir geldesivir ribavirin and remdesivir with the latter having received the most attention remdesivir a prodrug to adenosine 146 was originally developed for the treatment of hemorrhagic fever viruses namely ebola ebov and marburg viruses but underperformed in ebov treatment compared to antibody strategies both have antiviral in vitro activity in mers and sars 147148 competing with atp and substituting for adenosine during rna synthesis remdesivir inhibits the viral rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp 149 human mitochondrial rdrp show significantly lower affinity to remdesivir as compared to their viral counterparts mitigating side effects for the host cell 150the presence of cov-specific proof-reading exonucleases capable of removing phosphorylated remdesivir from the rna chain could present a potential for development of resistance remdesivir treatment for murine hepatitis virus in a mouse model showed that while conferring resistance the trade-off in viral fitness was of a magnitude sufficient to significantly attenuate viral pathogenicity 147 the timing of administration in animal models of ebov and mers was crucial for remdesivirs efficacy with most benefit achieved when given early 148 this is in keeping with aforementioned phases of the disease with highest virus replication rates early in disease and host-mediated damage through immune responses at later stages a recent case report however highlights persisting benefits also if late administration 151remdesivir underwent in vitro testing at the wuhan virus research institute early during the sars-cov2 outbreak 124 and was identified as potently inhibiting viral infection in cell cultures at concentrations readily achievable in vivo it was first used successfully in a covid-19 patient in january 2020 152 since remdesivir has been employed on a compassionate use basis and results for its use as a 10 day course reported for 53 patients with sars-cov2 34 of whom required ecmo 4 or mechanical ventilation 30 at baseline 153 significantly reducing mortality assessment in randomized controlled trials is needed two of which had been in place in china for the treatment of moderate to severe covid-19 with recruitment terminated in march following declaration of containment nct04257656 nct04252664 trials are currently ongoing in europe and north america with effective reduction of pulmonary viral load in animal models an acceptable safety profile in ebola patients and a small group of covid-19 patients remdesivir may offer an effective and viable future treatment optionthe combination of lopinavir and ritonavir lpvr better known by tradenames aluvia and kaletra is a frequently used antiretroviral treatment for hiv combining two protease inhibitors limits otherwise extensive cyp3a4 activation and drug metabolism thereby resulting in much improved bioavailability of lpv 154 proteases are critical for viral replication as they cleave both structural and functional proteins from precursor viral polypeptides fig 5
 thus enabling maturation into an infectious virion particle lpvr is mainly metabolized in the liver and thus pre-existing hepatic impairment is considered a relative contraindication 154in sars lpvr in combination with ribavirin was associated with a significant reduction in unfavorable outcomes ards and death as compared to ribavirin alone 24 versus 288 155 similar observations were made in a retrospective cohort study involving 1000 sars patients where lpvr was associated with significantly reduced mortality and need for intubation 73156 and it is currently being investigated by the who for use in mers patients in an ongoing randomized clinical trial early use of lpvr was recommended based on aforementioned pathophysiological considerations rather than clinical datain view of the in vitro activity against both sars and mers and the limited clinical data available for lpvr in treatment of critically ill sars-cov2 patients a randomized open-label trial was undertaken in wuhan china 157 it recruited almost 200 covid-19 patients randomized to either standard treatment or added lpvr for 14 days whilst confirming safety of lpvr use in covid-19 no significant differences were seen between groups in relation to survival or time to recovery thus leaving the authors question whether a combination of lpvr with a nucleoside analogue such as ribavirin would have resulted in improved outcomes trials exploring the therapeutic potential for lpvr are currentlyongoing httpswwwremapcaporgcoronavirus

not only for its use in sars-cov2 181 and a feasibility study exploring its use in mers found that in many survivors antibody titres were not high enough thus further limiting the donor pool 182 variable dosing issues surrounding donor recruitment in times of rapidly increasing patient numbers and drawbacks regarding safety of widespread use of human blood products all limit the availability and utility as widely available treatment optionfinally in viruses that are subject to ade such as sears-cov2 see above by non-neutralizing antibodies the option of plasma therapy also holds significant risks this complication has recently been exemplified by anti-zika virus antibodies enhancing dengue virus infection 183 thus the administration of hyperimmuneconvalescent plasma may carry the risk of significant illness upon future exposure to related or yet-to-emerge coronavirusesas mentioned above current management of covid-19 is mainly supportive and approved treatments based on scientific evidence are not available main causes of death include ards and cytokine storm syndrome also referred to as macrophage activation syndrome mas or secondary hemophagocytic histiocytosis hlh 7492106107 indeed ards occurs in 50 of patients with cytokine storm syndrome 184 considering impressively rapid development of systemic and pulmonary inflammation in a subset of patients with covid-19 early identification and control of derailed immune responses is of utmost importance based on data from chinese cohorts markers associated with cytokine storm in other conditions may be predictive of poor outcomes in covid-19 which include leukopenia lymphopenia thrombopenia hypoalbuminemia significantly elevated crp and il-6 hyperfibringenemia and prolongedthrombin time 74185186 however this needs to be tested prospectively and other more sensitive and specific biomarker may be identifiedfirst data on cytokine storm syndrome and its catastrophic effects on tissues and organs was generated in patients with familial hlh in which mutations in associated genes including prf1 unc13d stx1 stxp2 lyst xiap and others result in systemic inflammation and if not controlled death 109 standard treatment in these conditions include high-dose corticosteroids dexamethasone the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine a chemotherapy with etoposide and ultimately stem cell transplantation 187 while the underlying molecular causes of familial hlh are different to covid-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome clinical fevers organomegaly in some patients and laboratory features cytopenias massively elevated inflammatory parameters including crp esr and ferritin hypalbuminemia hyperfibrinogenaemia etc and consequences tissue and organ damage death overlap furthermore based on observations in the h1n1 influenza pandemic in 2009 a significant proportion of individuals developing disease-associated secondary cytokine storm syndrome may have mutations in one or more genes associated with familial hlh in h1n1 36 of fatalities were associated with mutations in genes associated with the perforin pathway 188thus clinical management of covid-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome may to some extent be informed by what we know from familial hlh however treatment of covid-19 associated cytokine storm should be more targeted and not include cytotoxic drugs andor stem cell transplantation as it is secondary to an infection which will hopefully be cleared
corticosteroids are used in primary and secondary forms of hlh and can control inflammation in ards 91189 first preliminary data from sars and covid-19 suggest that high-dose steroids did not have beneficial effects on lung injury 190191 instead high-dose corticosteroids are associated with complications in other forms of ards including avascular osteonecrosis 192 short courses of low- or medium-dose corticosteroids however have been suggested to be of benefit in a chinese cohort of critically ill covid-19 patients 193 taken together the limited data on the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in ards are anecdotal and not conclusive controlled trials do not exist as their use is associated with widely variable effects on pathogen clearance and evidence for their efficacy is lacking high-dose corticosteroids cannot be generally recommended for the treatment of covid-19 194 and the use of low dose regimens must be trialed in formal and controlled studies
intravenous immunoglobulins ivig are used in systemic autoimmuneinflammatory conditions to control systemic inflammation through several mechanisms including the capture of activated complement factors blockade of fc receptors inhibition of b and t lymphocyte differentiation and activation neutralisation of cytokines and antibodies etc 195 as mentioned above immune complexes containing viable virus may mediate infection activate fc receptors andor be deposited in tissues and organs lastly resulting in pro-inflammatory responses 196 of note ards and cytokine storm in sars coincided with serum conversion in a majority of patients supporting these arguments furthermore patients who ultimately died seroconverted significantly earlier when compared to individuals who recovered from infection 40197 based on these observations ivig may be of benefit to some patients by inhibiting fc receptors and limiting antibody-dependent enhancement discussed above furthermore aforementioned classical anti-inflammatory effects may limit systemic inflammation and anti-pathogen properties may be supportive in cases with bacterial superinfection or in patients who previously cleared sars-cov2 and developed specific antibodies 186198
the blockade of cytokines associated with hyper-inflammation during covid-19 is a more targeted approach when compared to the use of systemic corticosteroids and is a promising therapeutic avenue indeed first anecdotal reports suggest efficacy at least in some patientsthe il-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab has been used successfully in patients with secondary cytokine storm syndrome 199 including covid-19 200201 several studies have started or are about to be launched investigating efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with secondary cytokine storm syndrome in covid-19 including chictr2000029765 in china 202the recombinant il-1 receptor antagonist anakinra was originally developed to control cytokine storm and associated tissue damage in sepsis patients 203 subsequently anakinra has successfully been used in patients with cytokine storm syndrome secondary to autoimmuneinflammatory 204205 infectious or malignant disease 206 anakinra may have significant potential at controlling hyper-inflammation in severe covid-19 disease considering the absence of severe side-effects in aforementioned sepsis trials 203 and reduced frequency of neutropenia and hepatotoxicity when compared to tocilizumab currently anakinra is being trialled in a randomised placebo-controlled study in children and adults with covid-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome in china nct02780583 91
inhibition of janus kinases jak with small molecules is a relatively new concept used in systemic autoimmuneinflammatory conditions jaks are involved in cytokine receptor signaling including but not limited to the il-6 receptor as well as type 1 and type 2 ifn receptors 91207 they mediate the phosphorylation of stat family transcription factors which are in turn involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression thus jak inhibitors efficiently limit cytokine expression and may aid in controlling cytokine storms 91 however jaks are also centrally involved in controlling the expression of t1ifn which plays a key role in limiting virus replication and initiating pathogen clearance 208 at least in the initial stages of covid-19 disease when virus replication and infection may be limited to the epithelium sars-cov2 likely limits t1ifn expression see above therefore additional inhibition of jak through small molecules may be counterproductive as they further limit pathogen containment and clearance and may cause unforeseeable complications thus jak inhibition may not be the most suitable target-directed treatment option in covid-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome andor ards to our knowledge at least two clinical trials are ongoing to test efficacy and safety of jak inhibitors in severe covid-19 chictr2000030170 chictr2000029580the previously discussed mechanisms of infection immune evasion and dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses cause significant concern for and among patients on systemic immune modulating treatments including patients with malignant or systemic autoimmuneinflammatory diseases based on previous coronavirus outbreaks sars and mers and first small observational studies in covid-19 cohorts risk factors for poor outcomes include old age presence of comorbidities diabetes metabolic syndrome etc obesity male sex coronary heart disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and kidney disease 209 of note immune modulation or suppression was not identified as a risk factor for poor prognosis in china or italy 186210 while this could generally be considered good news immune suppression and associated altered immune function may predispose patients to infection and potentially prolong virus spreading furthermore as covid-19 is associated with lymphopenia patients receiving immune modulating treatment may be prone to secondary infections such as bacterial pneumoniaas discussed above some immune modulating drugs may protect from viral infections antimalarial drugs chloroquine hydroxychloroquine may inhibit tissue infection and viral replication 53103 furthermore immune modulating medications anti-malarial drugs classical as well as biologic dmards and others may prevent or control cytokine storm syndromesuncontrolled discontinuation of immune modulating treatment may result in disease flares in autoimmuneinflammatory conditions organ rejection in transplant patients or reoccurrence of malignancies which on top of obvious effects may also all increase the risk for viral infection thus national and international societies including the acr and eular recommend continuation of treatment in the absence of symptoms and alterations to existing treatment regimens only in agreement with and under close monitoring by the responsible clinical service 211212 international collaboration is needed and under way to safely assess individual risk in these vulnerable patient groups until reliable data is available close clinical monitoring and social distancing should be prioritizedas immunity does not exist and a significant proportion of humans develop severe disease the novel coronavirus sars-cov2 is a threat to millions globally sars-cov2 has the capacity to escape innate immune responses which allows the pathogen to produce large copy numbers in primarily infected tissues usually airway epithelia through the infection of innate immune cells andor the recruitment of uninfected cells from the circulation to the primary site of infection massive immune reactions induce hyperinflammation that can result in a cytokine storm and life-threatening

started in wuhan china in december 2019 and has rapidly spread throughout the world 1 as of april 24 2020 the overall outbreak had caused over 191000 deaths and approximately 2700000 infections sars-cov-2 shares genomic similarities with two human coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov about 80 and 50 respectively which have caused fatal infections in the past 20 years 2 covid-19 causes a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms with cough fever myalgia and malaise to full-blown viral pneumonia which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 34 currently three phenotypes are observed in covid-19 patients indicating three stages of the infections progression and extent i mild benign infection 80 in patients with minor and nonspecific symptoms who will not progress to a more severe disease ii moderate overt pneumonia with or without hypoxia and localized inflammation 15 in patients requiring hospitalization and iii severe systemic hyperinflammation and ards 5 in patients who require critical care management and at risk of fatal outcome 1-2 56 despite multiple targeted and non-targeted interventions no treatment has yet proven effective in treating covid-19 numerous clinical trials are ongoingas the pandemic progresses the pathophysiology of covid-19 is becoming clearer and the potential of multiple cytokine andor anti-cytokine interventions is raised indeed it has been reported that covid-19 associates states of both immunodeficiency and hyperinflammation with the latter being manifested by a cytokine stormin this paper we summarize todays principal findings and attempt to establish a more definitive view of covid-19 pathophysiology focusing on one key question how can antiviral immunity be reinforced and hyperinflammatory damages be avoided in the second half of this paper we will describe the early results of clinical investigations which have assessed targeted and non-targeted therapiesin this review we will not discuss antiviral strategies used to treat covid-19 nor will we discuss how to manage the wide spectrum of sars-cov2 infection-related complications such as thromboembolism vasculitis chilblains acute kidney injury or neurologic involvementssars-cov-2 is a zoonotic -coronavirus which infects human airways and enters cells by binding its s spike protein envelope to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 hace2 after s protein priming by host serine protease tmprss2 7 hace2 is present in type ii alveolar cells representing about 80 of all hace2-expressing cells nasal mucosa upper respiratory tract endothelium heart kidney and intestine cells 8 it has been reported that patients with diabetes hypertension or patients treated with ibuprofen are at higher risk of contracting severe covid-19 9 10 11 in these patients because there is increased expression of hace2 on lung epithelial cells some authors have postulated a connection between these points 12 of note another receptor cd147 has been implicated in mediating host cell invasion by sars-cov-2 13 after binding to its receptor the virus enters the cells through endocytosis viral rna is released into the cytosol the virus exploits the cell machinery to replicate and it is further excreted from the cell by exocytosis 14lung injury directly induced by the virus remains poorly explained patients with high viral loads and long virus-shedding periods are at higher risk of severe covid-19 15 the early onset of rapid viral replication may cause massive epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis vascular leakage as well as pro-inflammatory mediator release 16 furthermore hace2 downregulation and shedding by viral s protein can cause dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system and exacerbate inflammation and vascular permeability leading to acute lung injury 1718 finally recent data have suggested that sars-cov-2 can directly infect t cells through receptor-dependent s protein-mediated membrane fusion 19 nevertheless t cells have a very low expression level of hace2 suggesting either an alternative receptor or high s protein affinity for hace2 t cell infection is abortive meaning that sars-cov-2 cannot replicate within t cells but rather induces cell death 19 in sars-cov infection the modulation of tnf--converting enzyme tace or adam17 by the spike protein of sars-cov and hace2 induces tnf- production which may accentuate t cell apoptosis 2021 in this vein xiong et al reported upregulation of apoptosis autophagy and p53 pathways in pbmcs from covid-19 patients when compared to healthy controls 22epidemiological studies have demonstrated an elevation of acute phase reactants in patients with covid-19 including esr c-reactive protein crp serum amyloid a and ferritin suggesting a rapid activation of the innate immune response 323 24 25 accordingly covid-19 patients have high levels of circulating tnf- il-1 il-1ra sil-2r il-6 il-10 il-17 il-18 ifn- mcp-3 m-csf mip-1a g-csf ip-10 and mcp-1 2326these results are suggestive of hypercytokinemia which is a hallmark of covid-19 nevertheless only the serum concentrations of certain of these cytokines make it possible to discriminate between mild moderate and severe cases mainly il-1  il-1ra il-6 il-7 il-10 ip-10 and tnf- 26 in addition the levels of these cytokines in mildmoderate cases are generally below levels observed in usual macrophage activation syndromereactive hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis masrehlh or in severe cytokine release syndrome crs 2728 thus hypercytokinemia should be regarded as a general marker of sars-cov-2 while the term cytokine storm should be kept for those situations of overly exuberant inflammation leading to critical conditions such as ards disseminated intravascular coagulation or multiple organ failurewithin cells rna viruses are sensed by the innate immune system through three major classes of pattern recognition receptors prrs toll-like receptors ie tlr-3 -7 -8 rig-i-like receptors rlrs and nod-like receptors nlrs 29 among tlrs only tlr-7 and -8 recognize single stranded viral genomic rna nonetheless other cytosolic sensors such as tlr-3 and rig-imda5 may detect the virus intermediates during intracellular replication including double stranded rna 30 these recognitions then activate downstream signaling effectors ie nf-b and irf37 nf-b promotes the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf- il-1 and il-6 further triggering th1 and th17 inflammatory responses with subsequent secretion of ifn- and il-17 irf37 promote type-i ifn production which in turn activates the jak1tyk2-stat12 pathway stat1 and stat2 form a complex with irf9 that translocates into the nucleus where it initiates the transcription of hundreds of genes called ifn-stimulated genes isgs an early and robust type-i ifn response is required as the very first line of defense to suppress viral replication and spreadearly nlr engagement has also been postulated during the innate immune response against coronaviruses 16 evidence of nlrs directly recognizing viral rna is scant 31 however nlrs are more possibly involved in detecting intracellular homeostasis perturbations or danger signals such as ros production 3233 evidence of their involvement can be found in the observation of high levels of circulating il-1 il1-ra and il-18 2326 and synergistic upregulation of il1 and il1rn genes in the lung 34 indeed some nlrs are able to assemble a multimolecular platform termed inflammasome via recruiting the adaptor asc apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a card which in turn activates the proinflammatory caspase-1 caspase-1 cleaves and activates il-1 and il-18 and induces a hyperinflammatory form of cell death termed pyroptosis through the cleavage of the pore-forming gasdermin-d 3235 il-1 family cytokines include il-1 il-1 il-18 and their bioavailability is regulated by soluble antagonists il-1ra il-18bp of either endogenous origin or resulting from therapeutic intervention 3637 the most frequently studied inflammasome sensor nlrp3 drives inflammation during sars-cov infection through several activating pathways 38 39 40 41 given the similarities between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 comparable mechanisms likely intervene during the acute phase of covid-19of note the cytosolic sensor rig-i can also associate with asc to form a non-canonical inflammasome inducing caspase-1 activation and subsequent il1-il-18 secretion and pyroptosis 42 il-1 secretion may itself contribute to hypercytokinemia since il-1 further induces the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-6lastly high levels of chemokines and their coupled receptors have been observed in covid-19 patients 222326 accordingly analysis of the molecular signature within the balfs of patients revealed a plethora of upregulated chemokine transcripts including neutrophil-recruiting mediators cxcl8 cxcl1 cxcl2 cxcl10 ccl2 ccl7 and other attractants of monocytes and immune cells cxcl6 cxcl11 ccl2 ccl3 ccl4 ccl7 ccl8 ccl20 34 these results are consistent with pathological findings attesting to lung infiltration by monocytes macrophages and neutrophils in contrast with lower amounts of lymphocytes 43 this hyperactivated chemotaxis may play a major role in developing a pulmonary-centric disease by driving accumulated immune cells into the lungs and restricting the immune response to this particular organas stated above type-i ifn is critical for protecting against viral infections since it promotes intracellular rna degradation and virus clearance induces tissue repair and triggers a prolonged adaptive immune response 44 45 46 type-i ifn is mainly produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells pdcs which are less sensitive to productive viral infection andor virus-mediated cytotoxicity and can produce other inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-6 or control t cell response 4748 pdcs are circulating immune cells which act as sentinels and are activated after physical contact with virally-infected cells and transfer of pamps to the tlr7 sensors in pdcs part of a process termed interferogenic synapse 49 this synapse enables robust type-i ifn production at the infected site thereby possibly limiting viral replication and systemic deleterious response data derived from the sars-cov and mers-cov outbreaks have revealed that coronaviruses suppress type-i ifn response by interfering with prrs or type-i ifn receptor-signaling pathways for instance sars-cov induces the degradation of rna sensor adaptor molecules mavs and traf36 thus inhibiting irf3 translocation into the nucleus mers-cov employs additional strategies such as repression of histone modifications both viruses inhibit jakstat signaling by decreasing stat1 phosphorylationconsidering the 80 overlap between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 it has been speculated that the latter uses similar strategies to dampen innate immune response nevertheless sars-cov2 appears to have lower pathogenicity than sars-cov with about a 10-fatality rate suggesting a lesser ifn antagonism 50 on the other hand exceptional genetic defects or immunosenescence may account for a reduced type-i ifn response and greater severity of covid-19 accordingly increased age is associated with a poorer outcome 362351in mouse models of sars-cov and mers-cov infections a delayed type-i ifn response may explain more severe disease with compromised virus control and paradoxical hyperinflammation induced by type-i ifn itself 52 this leads to an influx of neutrophils and monocytes-macrophages the major sources of pro-inflammatory cytokines and further apoptosis of t cells epithelial and endothelial cells 52 53 54 55 these acute inflammatory mechanisms damage the pulmonary microvascular and alveolar barrier and cause vascular leakage and alveolar edema converging to ards therefore not only the strength of the response but also its timing would appear to play a critical role in coronavirus infection fig 1

in vitro sars-cov-2 displays a greater sensitivity to type-i ifn than sars-cov56 furthermore sars-cov-2 does not impair stat1 phosphorylation interestingly mildmoderate infection by sars-cov-2 is associated with a potent type-i ifn response characterized by the robust expression of isgs in patients balfs 34 moreover preliminary results have revealed early ifn production in peripheral blood from patients with mildmoderate to severe forms during the first week of covid-19 trouillet-assant et al in press in contrast about 20 displayed no ifn production another study found the type-i ifn response to be high between days 8-12 in mild-to-moderate patients while reduced in more severe patients who had a striking downregulation of ifn-stimulated genes 57 these results are in line with previous conclusions and would indicate that the characteristics of type-i ifn response - both in terms of kinetics and intensity - could be linked to clinical outcome 52 how exactly sars-cov-2 escapes type-i ifn in some patients remains to be elucidatedlymphopenia is one of the most prominent markers of covid-19 and has been observed in over 80 of patients 235859 analyses have shown that all subsets of lymphocytes were decreased including cd4 and cd8 cytotoxic t cells 5760 natural killer nk cells memory and regulatory t cells 61 along with b cells 62 lower lymphocyte counts are closely linked to severe disease 6162 in addition to being quantitatively decreased t cells exhibit elevated exhaustion levels and reduced functional diversity 6063 t cell numbers are negatively correlated with serum il-6 il-10 and tnf- and with higher levels of exhaustion markers such as pd-1 or tim-3 576064 patients with severe form of covid-19 have less multifunctional and more non-functional cd4 t cells as well as fewer non-exhausted cd8 t cells than patients with mild covid-19 63several explanations are posited to explain this sars-cov-2-induced lymphopeniafirst the virus can directly infect t cells but cannot replicate within the cells 19 t cell infection may thus result in cell death by apoptosis necrosis or pyroptosis 196566second a number of inhibitory cytokines are released by infected lung macrophages or epithelial cells first wave of hypercytokinemia including tnf- which causes t cell apoptosis 21 il-10 which is known to prevent t cell proliferation 67 and type-i ifn which regulates lymphocyte recirculation 68 t cell exhaustion characterizing severe covid-19 may stem from increased pd-1 or tim-3 expression from elevated levels of inhibitory il-10 60 or from increased il-6-induced expression of socs3 69 70 71 interestingly il-2 and il-7 the cytokines responsible for expansion and differentiation of various t cell subsets are increased in the sera of patients having either mildmoderate or severe forms of covid-19 23 nevertheless these increased levels most likely represent attempts by the immune system to reverse lymphopenia and t cell exhaustionlastly lymphopenia has been thought to be the result of immune cells redistribution with accumulation of lymphocytes in the lungs or lymphoid organs 72 however though pathological results are scarce and contradictory it would seem that alveolar or interstitial tissues are not invaded by lymphocytes but rather by monocytes macrophages and moderate numbers of multinucleated giant cells 43 more intriguingly autopsies have revealed that secondary lymphoid tissues had been destroyed with atrophied spleen and decreased lymphocyte numbers accompanied by significant cell degeneration focal hemorrhagic necrosis plus macrophage proliferation and phagocytosis lymph nodes were atrophied and their number decreased with signs of necrosis immunohistochemical staining demonstrated decreased rates of cd4 and cd8 t cells in the spleen and lymph nodes 61sudden and rapidly progressing clinical deterioration has been widely mentioned in late stages of covid-19 around 7-10 days this often manifests as an unexpected aggravation of symptoms fever dyspnea and is correlated with increased levels of acute phase reactants esr crp ferritin coagulopathy elevated titers of d-dimers disseminated intravascular coagulation and cell lysis ck ldh 34112359 in the most severe patients clinical and laboratory parameters correlated with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines il-1 il-1ra il-6 tnf- and sil2-r evocative of a cytokine storm 373 74 75 interestingly ards occurs in sars-cov patients despite a diminishing viral load suggesting that exuberant host immune response may be responsible for this outcome rather than viral virulence such a cytokine profile is strongly reminiscent of both cytokine release syndrome crs seen in car t cell therapy and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh 7677 numerous authors have paralleled the covid-19 cytokine storm to either primary or reactive hlh rehlh because of its close resemblance including high fever cytopenia hyperferritinemia abnormal liver tests coagulopathy and pulmonary involvement including ards occurring in approximately 50 of patients with rehlh 737478 in adults rehlh is most often triggered by viral infections and is observed in 3 - 4 of sepsis cases 79 herpesviridae eg epstein-barr virus and influenza are major triggers of such cytokine storms 77 systemic diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus or the autoinflammatory adult-onset stills disease and its pediatric counterpart can also be complicated by cytokine storm known as the macrophage activation syndrome identical to rehlh 80 81 82 in all these conditions il-1 il-18 ifn- and il-6 are key mediators of hyperinflammationsimilar to what is observed in sars-cov-2 infection the immunodeficiency linked to abnormal t cell number or function genetically determined in primary hlh appears to be the primum mobile of most cytokine storms 83 84 85 86 87 although an alternative pathway of primary hyperactivated innate immunity is possible it is more likely that this cytokine storm occurs due to the combination of a defective or delayed first line of defense followed by persistent hypercytokinemia il-6 il-1 and tnf- and dysfunctional t cell response generally cytotoxicity this results in an impaired clearance of apoptic cells or infectedactivated macrophages an increase in viral replication and dissemination followed by an il-18ifn- feedforward loop activating macrophages culminating in multiple cytokine release hemophagocytosis coagulopathy and ards fig 2
 858889 some of these mediators may further fuel this vicious cycle including nk cell function impairment by il-6 71 or macrophage activation by the h-chain of ferritin 90 91 92 quite importantly hemophagocytosis has been reported in lung tissues from patients who succumbed to sars-cov infection 93thus in covid-19 the onset of ards may be the consequence of a hlh-like syndrome after a first period of lung damage mainly localized within the lungs due to a prior accumulation of large amounts of innate immune cells systemic features of hlh are lacking such as extremely high titers of ferritinemia organomegaly and severe end-organ disease but this is most probably the consequence of lymphoid organ immune cell depopulation of 43analysing more precisely the immunopathology of sars-cov2-related ards giamarellos-bourboulis et al have come to the conclusion that two patterns of immune dysfunction exist in worsening covid-19 i one pattern highly suggestive of macrophage activation syndrome hyperferritinemia and elevated h score  25 of patients which is driven by il-1 and ii one pattern with immune dysregulation driven by il-6 71 the latter was characterized by a combination of hypercytokinemia immunoparalysis as indicated by decreased hla-dr molecules on cd14 monocytes and global lymphopenia including cd4 and nk cells interestingly il-6 blockade with tocilizumab partially restored hla-dr expression on cd14 monocytes and increased the circulating lymphocyte counta number of key points stand out in this overview of the immunopathology of sars-cov-2 infection1while the virus induces both impairment and hyperactivation of the immune system these are sequential and the latter seems to ensue from the former at least partially2an early viral clearance by type-i ifn is a key to preventing further viral replication t cell exhaustion and subsequent cytokine storm3therapies when applicable should be administered with the right timing ie antivirals and immune boosters should be initiated promptly after symptom onset whereas immunosuppressants should be administered at the very start of the cytokine storm fig 14given the great frequency of non-severe presentations therapeutic interventions should be kept for selected patients ie those with risk factors or worsening diseases nonetheless except for advanced age elevated body mass index and comorbid conditions there is still a lack of robust prognostic factors 3232475
routine and non-routine markers can be monitored to help evaluate the risk of developing cytokine storm however at present no cut-off value has yet been proposed for any of these markers it would be of great benefit to analyze their trends in depth along with daily clinical evaluationsince type-i ifns key role in antiviral response and low or delayed ifn response has been associated with poor outcome ifn- and ifn- have emerged as potentially effective drugs against sars-cov-2 5294 evidence is mainly derived from experience with sars-cov and mers-cov infections 95 in vivo type-i is most often used in combination with other antiviral drugs such as lopinavirritonavir 96 97 98 99 or ribavirin 100 101 102 in vitro ifn- and - have very systematically demonstrated robust efficacy against coronaviruses but proved disappointing when transposed to human diseases 9596100103 multiple biases in these trials have prevented drawing conclusions from them these biases include coronavirus escape strategies to type-i ifn limited sample sizes heterogeneous experimental designsclinical conditions the nature of ifn isoform administration route plus difficulties in assessing whether disease outcome was linked to type-i ifn or to the drugs used in combination key points which have emerged from these studies are i ifn-1b and ifn-1a are the most potent subtypes for sars-cov inhibition probably even more for sars-cov-2 56104105 ii type-i ifn must be administered as soon as possible after infection ideally before symptom onset although not in the late phase because of possible tissue damage 552106107 and iii although ifn- inhalation can lower sars-cov-2 infection rate and serve in prophylaxis or treatment chinese guidelines 108 the preferred solutions remain the better-evaluated safer intravenous and subcutaneous routes 94109even though type-i ifn is being evaluated in several clinical trials either alone nct04293887 nct04320238 chictr2000029989 or in combination nct04254874 nct04276688 nct04273763 nct04315948 nct04350684 nct04350281 nct04343768 nct04350671 only one single retrospective study is currently available 110 zhou et al compared 77 adults with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 who were treated with either nebulized ifn-2b 5 mu bid oral umifenovir 200 mg tid or a combination of both 110 the authors found that treatment with ifn-2b - with or without umifenovir - significantly reduced the duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract and reduced the duration of elevated inflammatory markers il-6 and crp unfortunately this study has major flaws i the study did not include a control group ii only moderate forms of covid-19 were included with a median time from symptom onset to treatment of 11 days range 5 -22 iii patients in the ifn--treated group were significantly younger and had fewer comorbidities iv the only patients treated with ifn-2b alone were women and v treatment regimens were quite heterogeneous since in the combination group 34 of patients received ifn-2b as add-on to umifenovir and 52 started ifn-2b after umifenovir had been stopped none of the patients developed end organ dysfunction nor respiratory failure requiring oxygen or critical care management interestingly another study prospectively evaluated ifn-1b nasal drops to prevent medical staff sars-cov-2 infection 111 2944 medical staff members were allocated to either a low-risk group n2415 4-6 drops qid for 28 days or a high-risk group nasal drops  subcutaneous thymosin-1 every week depending on their exposure to the coronavirus the control group consisted of medical staff in the same areas of hubei province china the 28-day incidence of covid-19 amounted to zero for both groups whereas over 2000 new covid-19 cases were diagnosed among medical personnel over the same period despite problems of major bias this study suggests that ifn-1b could serve as an efficient prophylactic against covid-19additional well-designed studies involving timely administration of ifn- are thus eagerly awaitedlymphopenia and lymphocyte exhaustion are hallmarks of covid-19 and are possibly responsible for the cytokine storm due to defective clearance of both virus and infected cells it is thus tempting to speculate that il-7 - the major cytokine promoting lymphocyte expansion and possibly reversal of t cell exhaustion - may be useful in restoring immune system homeostasis il-7 exerts anti-apoptotic properties and induces potent proliferation of naive and memory t cells leading to replenishment of the circulating pool cd4 and cd8 112113 il-7 also increases t cell receptor repertoire diversity 114 and promote the expression of cell adhesion molecules improving the capacity of t cells to traffic to infection sites 115 more importantly the administration of recombinant il-7 ril-7 does not induce hyperinflammatory response through stimulating adaptive immunity indeed ril-7 has been successfully used to treat t cell exhaustion following septic shock and restore cd4 t cells in hiv patients with no evidence of clinical deterioration nor proinflammatory marker exacerbation tnf- il-6 crp 116117 surprisingly at the time of writing this review there is no trial registered yet to evaluate this strategy if such a study were to be launched the perfect timing for lymphocyte restoration would need to be strictly determinednot only is il-6 a major mediator within the cytokine storm its levels have been closely correlated with ards severity and outcome along with blood sars-cov-2 viral load 7174118 a recent meta-analysis reported 29-fold higher serum levels in patients with complicated covid-19 compared to patients with non-complicated disease 119 inhibitors of il-6 or its receptor have been successful in treating other cytokine storm syndromes such as rehlh associated with adult-onset stills disease 120 or crs secondary to car t cell therapies 28121 several drugs are available including il-6 receptor inhibitors tocilizumab sarilumab and il-6 inhibitors siltuximab clazakizumab sirukumab 122to date only four studies and case reports are available 123 124 125 126 127xu et al have reported on 21 severe or critical patients treated with tocilizumab although there was no control group 123 this first study demonstrated decreased oxygen requirements 75 resolution of ct-scan abnormalities 905 and clinical improvement 100 no adverse events or deaths were reported to estimate the results of a potential control group not administered tocilizumab xu et al referred to the results of a previous study which found a baseline mortality rate of 60 in critical patients and 11 in severe patients admitted to one icu 9the second study from china retrospectively analyzed 15 patients median age 73 years with moderate n2 severe n6 and critical n7 forms of covid-19 124 eight patients received concurrent methylprednisolone three patients died all from the critical group 1 patient improved 9 were clinically stabilized and 2 experienced disease worsening a persistent increase of serum il-6 was observed in 4 out of 5 patients resulting in either aggravation or fatal outcomethe third study performed in italy analyzed 21 patients with covid-19 who developed ards and were enrolled into a compassionate-use program 125 all patients received siltuximab at doses ranging from 700 to 1200 mg clinical improvement was observed in 33 of patients 43 stabilized as evidenced by absence of clinically-relevant change in condition and 24 experienced a worsened condition one patient died and one patient suffered a cerebrovascular event the absence of control group precludes final conclusions basically because the mortality rate for patients undergoing standard of care was not mentionedfinally roumier et al reported their experience regarding tocilizumab in 30 selected patients 23 in icu 127 patients were aged 80 with 5-days disease duration and with severe pneumonia ie requiring  6lmin of oxygen and rapidly deteriorating ie increase by more than 3lmin of oxygen flow within the previous 12 hours the control group standard of care included patients matched for age gender and disease severity patients were followed-up for a median of 8 days tocilizumab significantly reduced mechanical ventilation requirement or 042 p0025 and risk of subsequent icu admission or 017 p0001 there was a trend though no statistical difference toward lower mortality tocilizumab was well-tolerated yet the author reported two mild liver test disturbances and one ventilator-acquired pneumoniathese mixed results must be further clarified most notably since experimental models have shown that il-6 can either suppress or facilitate viral replication 128 one crucial remaining question to answer will be the optimal timing for anti-il6 administration if too early the drugs may adversely affect viral clearance if too late the drugs may not be effective enough the perfect timing of this must be assessed in trials at present several clinical trials are under way to evaluate the safety and efficacy of il-6 inhibitors with various protocols and comparators

extensive bilateral lung lesions opacity or in severe or critical patients who have elevated laboratory detected il-6 levels more recently the infectious diseases society of america idsa has published

natural antagonist ie il-1ra have been observed in the peripheral blood and balf of patients with covid-19-induced pneumonia 22232671 this is a striking result since il-1 has a short half-life in serum and is rarely isolated in peripheral blood this finding suggests high levels of il-1 production reinforced by reports indicating il1b and il1r1 gene upregulations 57il-1 is a proinflammatory cytokine that is activated and secreted upon activation of the inflammasome 32 nlrp3 the most-frequently studied inflammasome is activated by danger signals which have been suggested to be viroporin a

was not found to be elevated in the sera or balfs of patients with severe forms of covid-19 222326149 actually there are even conflicting results showing a mild elevation in the sera of non-severe patients 232675150 however one meta-analysis has shown a link between high il-6ifn- ratio and disease severity thereby indicating that lower levels of ifn- should rather predict poorer outcomes 151

therapy despite a lack of clinical trial data in adults 152153 however in the single rct on 34 patients serious adverse reactions occurred in 53 of the recipients including bacterial viral and opportunistic infections and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in addition data from mouse models suggest that simultaneously inhibiting multiple cytokine-signaling pathways such as with jak inhibitors may be more effective than targeting ifn- alone 154155 rcts are now ongoing to evaluate emapalumab in hlh either primary or reactive nct01818492 nct0331275 nct03985423 nct03311854 and in covid-19 nct04324021tnf is present in covid-19 patients blood and diseased tissues and its levels are even higher in patients with severe disease 236175156 since tnf inhibitors are readily available and well-evaluated drugs some authors postulate that there is sufficient evidence to conduct clinical trials in covid-19 157 nevertheless the literature remains very scanty when exploring possible treatments for cytokine storm or hlh indeed while a few case reports described the benefits of etanercept 158 159 160 other studies have shown that it may trigger or worsen disease progression 161 162 163 however some cases argue for tnf inhibitors use in covid-19 i tnf neutralization provides protection against sars-cov infection in animal models 164 ii anti-tnf induce a rapid decrease of il-6 and il-1 concentrations in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis 165 iii anti-tnf trigger a reduction of adhesion molecules and vascular endothelial growth factor which is partly responsible for capillary leak 166167 and iv anti-tnf lead to less leucocyte traffick to inflamed tissues due to reduced adhesion molecules and chemokines with subsequent reduction of cell content and exudate 168 it is suggested that initial assessments of tnf inhibitors should be done in patients with moderate disease as soon as possible after their admission to hospital 157 to date only a single rct evaluating adalimumab in covid-19 has been registered chictr2000030089corticosteroids are potent cytokine inhibitors working through several mechanisms but mainly by inhibiting the nf-b transcription factor they are the cornerstone of treatments for cytokine storms and hlh associated with autoimmuneautoinflammatory diseases however their use in managing sars-cov-2 patients is currently highly contested 169 170 171 indeed a systematic review of observational studies on corticosteroids administered to sars-cov infected patients reported no survival benefit plus potential harm although mostly inconclusive 95 similarly a systematic review of observational studies in influenza found a higher risk of mortality and secondary infections with high-dose corticosteroids 172 further a study of patients given corticosteroids for mers-cov infection revealed delayed clearance of the virus and zero effect of corticosteroids on mortality 173 finally while most previous guidelines did not recommend corticosteroid use for treating sepsis in the absence of refractory shock a recent statement triggered by the analysis of two rcts made a weak recommendation to use corticosteroids in sepsis patients 174 altogether it has become apparent that corticosteroids may be more detrimental than beneficial in covid-19 and the who as well as idsa recommends that they not be used outside of clinical trials 175 however given that these data are derived from previous infections corticosteroids have been recommended as adjuvant therapy by chinas national health commission in particular one study of 201 patients has found that among patients who developed ards n84 418 treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death hr 038 95 ci 020-072 p0003 24 nevertheless in a recent meta-analysis of 15 studies on covid-19 corticosteroids were associated with significantly higher mortality rr211 p0019 longer length-of-stay p0001 and higher rates of bacterial infection rr208 p0001 176such conflicting findings are most likely linked to the heterogeneity of protocols and clinical conditions and above all to different timings of in corticosteroid administration thus there is no doubt that the main challenge of up-coming rcts will be to define the precise moment and best dosages for preventing hyperinflammation while lessening the risks of prolonged viral shedding and secondary bacterial infectionsthere has been tremendous debate about chloroquine or its derivative hydroxychloroquine as potentially effective treatments in covid-19 although these drugs have in vitro antiviral properties 177 178 179 including on sars-cov-2 180 studies have systematically failed to demonstrate positive effects in human viral diseases both drugs can prevent the virus binding to hace2 in vitro or inhibit viral cycle 181 in addition they are used in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases mainly systemic lupus erythematosus for their immunomodulating properties it is hypothesized that their action is tied to their ability to accumulate in lysosomes where they raise ph and interfere with antigen degradation and presentation to cd4 t cells 182183 data also indicate that they reduce proinflammatory il-6 il-18 and tnf- 184185 lastly they inhibit endosomal tlrs and have anti-inflammatory effects such inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis or lipid peroxidation 186 187 188altogether chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are thought to be able to reduce viral load and prevent cytokine storm at the time of writing this review seven articles are reporting clinical data observational studies or clinical trials with either positive n4 189 190 191 192 or negative n5 results 193 194 195 196 but no definitive conclusions can currently be drawn because of major biases in all of the studies 197 several rcts are also ongoing to evaluate these drugs in the context of covid-19 n32 registered with wwwclinicaltrialsgov n16 with the chinese clinical trial registryin conclusion it is noteworthy that several national guidelines already include chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine whereas the idsa recommends reserving its use in combination with azithromycin or not for clinical trialsother drugs are currently being investigated such as the jak inhibitors ie tofacitinib nct04332042 baricitinib nct04321993 nct04345289 nct04320277 nct04346147 nct04340232 ruxolitinib nct04348695 nct04331665 nct04337359 nct04338958 nct04334044 nct04348071 or colchicine the jakstat pathway lies downstream of several cytokines which are increased in hlh and thus it is an attractive target to abrogate the signaling of multiple cytokine pathways 198 however caution should be applied in using jak inhibitors because i covid-19 can be complicated by coagulopathy with increased frequency of thromboembolic events and the fda has recently warned clinicians about increased thromboembolism risk with some jak inhibitors 199 ii treatment with jak inhibitors is associated with increased frequency of herpes zoster virus reactivation and iii pan-jak inhibitors may repress some cytokines required for antiviral defense type-i ifn or for immune restoration il-2 il-7 200201colchicine is a long-established drug with anti-inflammatory properties used to treat patients with behets disease or familial mediterranean fever colchicine inhibits il-1 and its subsequent inflammatory cascade principally by blocking pyrin and to a lesser extent nlrp3 inflammasome activation until now there has been no data indicating that pyrin is activated upon sars-cov-2 infection and this would appear rather unlikely on the other hand nlrp3 is likely to be activated following virus entry into the cell 38 39 4065130 nevertheless the inhibition of nlrp3 inflammasome by colchicine has not been firmly demonstrated since in vitro it does not prevent il-1 secretion induced by typical nlrp3 stimuli ie atp nigericin 202 five rcts are currently under way to test the efficacy of colchicine in covid-19 patients nct04322682 nct04322565 nct04328480 nct04326790 nct04350320the rapid diffusion of covid-19 drives an urgent search for effective treatments mainly for its severe forms the disease is polyphasic in nature with secondary cytokine storm and ards resulting in poor outcomes plus overwhelmed intensive care units and hospitals in the very early stages of the disease treatment should focus on reducing viral load either by specific antivirals or by stimulating type-i ifn later on in selected patients therapies targeting proinflammatory cytokines could suppress hyperinflammation while some cytokines il-7 could theoretically trigger immune restoration in clinical practice unfortunately patients are unlikely to be detected early enough ie beforeat symptom onset to benefit from antiviral strategies therefore factors to predict progression toward severe forms of the disease are at present the most urgently needed and awaited determinants a highly-structured approach which includes immune monitoring would thus be of utmost importancethe authors declare that they have no conflict of interestcoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a severe public health emergency worldwide caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 1 the number of confirmed cases and the mortality rate are increasing worldwide and the world health organization who acknowledged covid-19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 2 currently there have been many efforts to diagnose a number of patients with symptoms or close contacts to prevent the spread in the community this may prevent some spreading of the virus but not perfectly moreover many confirmed cases are occurring through diagnosis but there is no definite guideline for the initial therapeutic approach for them and therefore many patients have been dying if the covid-19 symptoms are severe the patients are hospitalized and the treatment is done though they have not been established yet currently however no treatment is provided for those who are isolated at home or shelter among them there will be also some cases in whom severe lung injury or cytokine storm has progressed 3 leading to sudden death case fatality rates in some countries especially italy and spain are high and effective therapeutic measures are urgently needed 4 in this review we discuss some important points dedicated to the management of patients with covid-19 which should help reducing morbidity and mortalitypatients with covid-19 have higher leukocyte numbers c-reactive protein crp erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr d-dimer and an imbalance of proand anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines with increased levels of interleukin il-1 il-1ra il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 basic fibroblast growth factor fgf2

ip-10 mcp-1 mip1- and tnf- were found in individuals admitted to the intensive care unit icu 5 these cytokines may indicate patients at risk to develop acute lung injury followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and eventually death this circumstance is called cytokine release syndrome crs or cytokine storm 6the main pathogenesis of covid-19 may be similar to that of other viruses such as influenza or others however there have been few efforts to make a potential hypothesis why covid-19 could cause a higher incidence of acute lung injury ards cytokine storm and death than other viruses we are going to make a simple hypothetical model for the inflammatory processes and cytokine storm for covid-19 to understand the pathophysiology of covid-19 and its associated lung injury ards and cytokine stormfirst covid-19 sars-cov-2 is first attached to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors in the nasopharynx and respiratory epithelium 7second host immune responses are initiated after entry of covid-19 into the cells and the pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 are formed by various kinds of immune cells such as t cells b-cells and macrophages and others 89third the degree of increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines determines the degree of covid-19-induced lung injury the more increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines the higher the injury to lung tissue and the more severe the ards which could be related to higher mortalityfourth the degree of increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in covid-19 is higher as induced by other viruses especially this effect is more pronounced in older age and comorbid conditionsfifth the reason why this effect is less pronounced in younger age groups may be obscure but it could be due to the immaturity of immune system and the predominance of th2 immunity than th1 in these groupssixth the reason why this effect is more pronounced in older age groups and those with comorbid conditions may be obscure but it could be due to pre-existing subclinical or subtle inflammations represented by increased high-sensitive crp hscrp in these groupsseventh the exaggerated increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in covid-19 could be due to hyperactivation of various kinds of immune cells in response to n-protein of covid-19 which is called cytokine stormeighth this increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 cytokine storm can cause acute lung injury ards and eventually multiorgan failureninth cytokine storm may start from the early course of disease to later stage according to the degree of activation of host immune response and it may be rapidly progressive at any timetenth there may be clinico-pathologic non-correlations between them 3 the patient may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms despite severely progressed conditions which will delay the appropriate treatment at an early stage
the pathogenesis of covid-19 is summarized in fig 1
 regarding our immunity there are 3 states 1 immunosuppressive state 2 normal immune state this is also classified as lower normal normal and upper normal and 3 hyperimmune state if there are 100 normal persons they are distributed from 0 to 100 on a scale according to the degree of anti-viral immunity which will be mostly represented by th1 response if the person is immunocompromised heshe will have minus points on the scale the lower the minus number is located the more severe the immunosuppressive condition will be if the number is higher than 100 the person will get hyperactivated host immune response and will have lung injury ards and multiorgan failureif the person is infected with other usual respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus or influenza heshe will have fever and sore throat caused by host immune response however the degree of increase in inflammatory reaction will be 35 so if the person who has the number of immunity scale of 90 and infected by other viruses the number on a scale will increase to 9395 however the degree of increase in inflammatory reaction in patients with the current covid-19 will be 1015 therefore if the person who has the number of immunity scale 90 is infected by covid-19 the number on a scale will increase to 100105 which means that there will be a high probability that this patient will progress to cytokine storm due to hyperactivated immune response which might lead to deathbecause younger age groups immune system may be immature and they may have the predominance of th2 immunity than th1 10 they might have the number of immunity scale 030 therefore even though they are infected by covid-19 and the number is increased by 10-15 by covid-19 their number will be located between 10 and 45 therefore there is a lower possibility that they will be progress to severe cytokine storm which may explain less mortality in this grouphowever the person in an older age group will have multiple co-morbidities by aging process such as atherosclerosis hypertension diabetes mellitus metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease and they might have pre-existing subclinical or subtle inflammations represented by increased hscrp in these groups 11 therefore they might have a number of immunity scale 8595 therefore if they are infected by covid-19 and the number of 1015 is increased by covid-19 their number will be located between 95 and 110 therefore there is high possibility that they will progress to severe cytokine storm which may explain high mortality in this group surely there will be additional factors that influence the susceptibility and severity of covid-19 such as genetic variant of different polymorphisms or environmental factors as smokingin addition to this basic 1015 increase in the degree of inflammatory reaction if the patient progressed to cytokine storm the number will rapidly increase to 200300 we are going to discuss the use of steroids later but the basic increase of 1015 in various pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 might be suppressed by short-course low dose steroids in an early stage of disease but steroids may not be effective in a later stage of disease such as ards and multiorgan failure to suppress cytokine storm because 200300 cannot be suppressed even though high dose of steroids are used recently hydroxychloroquine has been shown to be effective in covid-19 12 and this drug may reduce the increase in the degree of inflammatory reaction however we do not know which agent may be better in decreasing inflammatory reactions and how much the number might be decreased by steroids or hydroxychloroquinein addition to these the rate of bacterial complications will increase in accordance with the progression with time after covid-19 we think if bacterial complication is combined with cytokine storm there will be more severe inflammatory reactions although this theory may not be perfect this may be helpful to understand the pathogenesis and potential harms of covid-19 and guide how patients should be treatedevidence based medicine ebm is the conscientious explicit judicious and reasonable use of modern best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients 13 ebm integrates clinical experience and patient values with the best available research information 13 many clinicians are applying the treatment to the current coronavirus covid-19 based on the previous experiences for mers or sars however this is not exactly evidence-based since covid-19 is different to be evidence-based a large-scale randomized placebo-controlled trial for covid-19 should urgently be conducted however it is too difficult to find an appropriate drug for covid-19 in a pandemic state because it will take a long time although this effort should also be done concurrentlyin addition even if the results of small rcts are meaningful those are often reversed when a larger rct is performed 14 moreover although the results of meta-analysis may be considered to be the best evidence this should be interpreted with caution because the meta-analysis results can be significant even though all the results of individual rcts have no statistical significance 15 furthermore it has been claimed that most published research findings are false and not useful 1617 though this should also be interpreted with caution and numerously published meta-analyses are also misleading 18 in addition guidelines suggested by experts can also have a mistake 19 in this context we should find what is the best strategies to protect the humans form the harms of covid-19 even though we apply several therapeutic strategies investigated in sars or mers it should be interpreted with caution if we cannot apply ebm immediately in this covid-19 pandemic we should also make every effort to find wise ways to solve the problems in this situation an experience-based approach may be also important in this pandemic era and many publications should urgently be published even though they are case reports or case seriescovid-19 is causing a severe public health emergency all over the word and the mortality is rapidly increasing all over the world we would like to remind of the basic principle for the treatment of patients but we often forget this do no harm 20 we should think of what harms means and what do no harms would look like in this pandemic we have thought and summarized the potential harms and the things we are doing now regarding covid-19 and it is summarized as below and table 1
1continuing smoking is a significant harm to respiratory epitheliums if so why dont we recommend cessation of smoking at this time not doing so is causing a significant harm to the patients2cytokine storm is considered to be a significant harm and an important cause of death if so why dont we make every effort to prevent this process at an early course of disease not doing so is causing a significant harm to the patients3currently some asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms have severe radiologic findings and bacterial complications which can lead to sudden death but no radiologic examinations and treatment are done for these patients until severe symptoms develop this may be considered to be a significant harm if so why dont we make every effort to detect these patients and treat them at an early course of disease not doing so is causing a significant harm to the patients4currently covid-19 infected patients are divided into two groups one is the person who is isolated at home but no medications are provided and the other is the person who developed severe symptoms with time and admitted to the hospital currently many patients with covid-19 are recommended to be at home until severe symptoms develop due to infectivity to others we think there will be a patient group with moderate symptoms in whom if early treatment is done with steroids and antibiotics they will not progress to severe conditions to let them at home will be a significant harm if so why dont we provide medications such as steroids or antibiotics at the time of covid-19 test and monitor the patient even by phone considering it is practically difficult for the patient to visit the clinic again if so policy should be changed in this pandemic era as medications should be given to the patients more liberally than in usual situations not doing so is causing a significant harm to the patients and hesitating for the use of steroids and antibiotics may be a harm to the patients with covid-195doing something is better than nothing currently there are no established guidelines for covid-19 and we rely on the previous treatments for sars mers or influenza or on expert opinions recently some investigators are discussing the beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 but this is just based on in vitro studies and not much experience but why dont we have more interests on the use of elderberry supplements which was shown to be effective in cold and influenza by randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study and meta-analysis 21 22 23 if some treatments such as elderberry supplements or betadine mouth or nasal spray are not causing significant harms we think doing something is better than nothing6misinterpretation of the various studies including systematic review without considering the biases will lead to a false guidance for the treatment of covid-19 which will be a significant harm 24 the role of experts who are doing evidence-based medicine or meta-research is very important to reduce the harm to the patients in this pandemic era see table 2

in addition to these there may be more current harms in this pandemic era and this should also be urgently discussedfirst smoking cessation should be encouraged this has always been recommended for general population but it has also been very difficult for the people to do so because covid-19 can predominantly damage the respiratory epitheliums and lungs this should at least be recommended recently it was also hypothesized that those individuals who have been exposed to nicotine prior to their exposure to the virus are primed to be at higher risk because nicotine can directly impact the putative receptor for the virus ace2 and lead to deleterious signaling in lung epithelial cells 25 in addition several cytokines including il-2 il-6 and tnf- which is induced by smoking might trigger cytokine storm in covid-19 we still do not know whether a short duration of smoking cessation could reduce the susceptibility or severity of covid-19 or not but if it is beneficial doing something smoking cessation is better than nothingsecond povidoneiodine polyvinylpyrrolidoneiodine pvp-i betadine mouth or nasal spray can be applied to kill the covid-19 viruses and it will reduce the number of covid-19 viruses which enter into the cells covid-19 is initiated by the attachment of the virus to the pharynx or respiratory epithelium and this causes sore throat currently however we do not know about whether the number of virus attached to the pharynx or respiratory epithelium will influence on the severity of covid-19 easily speaking when you inhaled 10 viruses and when you inhaled 1000 viruses will infection risk or the disease severity be same or different currently this cannot be proved easily however considering the effectiveness of a mask that prevents respiratory infections less exposure is likely to prevent infection by an indirect evidence one previous meta-analysis showed that physical measures are highly effective in preventing the spread of sars wearing masks odds ratio 032 95 ci 025 to 040 number needed to treat nnt  6 454 to 803 vs wearing n95 masks 009 003 to 030 nnt  3 237 to 406 26 we can make a potential hypothesis if 10 viruses were inhaled and attached to the throat this may be cleared by host immunity however if 1000 viruses were inhaled and attached to the throat it should go through a fight between the virus and host immunity if viruses are cleared by host immunity the person can be free from virus but if the viruses win they may replicate exponentially within a relatively short time and will cause viremia in the blood in this situation we still do not know whether the degree of viremia viral load might be correlated to the degree of host hyperimmune response or whether reduction of viruses in the throat for example using betadine mouth spray or gargles could decrease the degree of viremia in bloodcurrently inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and blocking angiotensin receptor 2 ar2 is considered to be the key target for sars-cov-2 vaccination and covid-19 therapy 27 due to this finding some authors recommend the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acei or angiotensin receptor 2 blockers arbs 28 currently these findings and suggestions cant be transferred into clinical practice easily acei and arbs are widely used in clinical daily practice no clinical studies have been made in the set of covid-19 outbreak so far even basic science due to the pathophysiological mechanisms eg effectiveness of blocking ar2 are limited 27 due to a substantiated benefit-risk evaluation a therapy with arbs or acei cannot be recommended in addition we do not know about how many ace2 receptors could be downregulated or blocked by antibodies or vaccines and how many entries of viruses could be inhibited by these if they are developed however if blocking entry of virus is a potential therapeutic target we think that direct killing of the virus in the throat by betadine mouth or nasal spray might be more efficacious than the receptor downregulationseveral studies showed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov could be inactivated by pvp-i in vitro 2930 one phase 1 study shows application of pvp-i nasal spray to the nasal mucosa did not result in any demonstrable limitation of the nasal function nor in detectable damage to the multilayer ciliated epithelium of the nose 31 because anyone can buy betadine mouth or nasal spray or gargles without a prescription as over-the-counter medicines if it does not cause any significant harm there is no reason not to use it and it can be applied if a person feels sore throat at an early course of the disease although side effects of pvp-i use are rare the adverse effect of iodine and other precautions should also be recognized pvp-i can cause allergic reactions and should not be used in patients suffering from thyroid diseases 32 even there exist no studies for pvp-i and sars-cov-2 either due to the benefit-risk evaluation pvp-i can be used in patients infected with sars-cov-2 with no or mild symptoms without allergies to pvp-i or thyroid diseases or if a person is visiting more crowded places such as airport it can also be applied easilythird the use of elderberry supplements should be considered at an early course of the disease although it has not been tested in coronavirus elderberry supplements which was shown to be effective in cold and influenza by randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study and meta-analysis 21 22 23 currently there was one cleveland clinic news reported by emily bamforth on the use of elderberry supplements 33 although there have been several reports on the beneficial effect of elderberry supplements on several viral infections 21 22 23 there have been few hypotheses on the potential immunologic mechanisms on the beneficial effect of elderberry supplements focusing on covid-19it is well known that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is a receptor for sars-cov 34 a recent study showed that sars-cov-2 covid-19 spike s glycoproteins also uses ace2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of sars-cov-2 s and sars-cov s bind with similar affinities to human ace2 correlating with the efficient spread of sars-cov-2 among humans 35 although less discussed than ace2 it was shown that cd209l l-sign encoded by clec4m is also a receptor for sars-cov 36 in this study cd209l was expressed in human lung in type ii alveolar cells and endothelial cells both potential targets for sars-cov and the large s glycoprotein of sars-cov might use both ace2 and cd209l in virus infection and pathogenesis 36 in addition chan et al demonstrated that individuals homozygous for clec4m tandem repeats are less susceptible to sars infection and l-sign is expressed in both non-sars and sars-cov-infected lung 37 they also showed that compared with cells heterozygous for l-sign cells homozygous for l-sign show higher binding capacity for sars-cov higher proteasome-dependent viral degradation and a lower capacity for trans infection suggesting that homozygosity for l-sign plays a protective role during sars infection 37 in summary the first encounter of the virus with the host might be through binding to attachment receptors such as these receptors which might play an important role of infection for a large number of enveloped viruses by capturing concentrating and transmitting infectious virions 38 once a virus reaches its target cell a cascade of events generally starting with the interaction of viral envelope glycoproteins with specific entry receptors and co-receptors is necessary in order to trigger the virus-cell membrane fusion 38although not much studied in coronavirus capture and transmission of hiv-1 by the c-type lectin l-sign was inhibited by carbohydrate-binding agents cbas 39 in this study both mannose- and n-acetylglucosamine glcnac-specific cbas dose-dependently prevented virus capture by l-sign-expressing 293 t-rexl-sign cells 39 because coronavirus also uses l-sign as a receptor for entry one study suggested that influenza virus and coronavirus infections might also qualify to be treated by cbas 40keyaerts et al evaluated the effect of 33 plant lectins with different specificities to coronavirus 41 they showed that the plant lectins possessed marked antiviral properties against both coronaviruses with ec50 values in the lower microgramml range middle nanomolar range being non-toxic cc50 at 50100 microgml and the strongest anti-coronavirus activity was found predominantly among the mannose-binding lectins in addition a number of galactose- n-acetylgalactosamine- glucose- and n-acetylglucosamine-specific plant agglutinines exhibited anti-coronaviral activity 41 they also found that there was a significant correlation with an r-value of 070 between the ec50 values of the 10 mannose-specific plant lectins effective against the two coronaviruses but little correlation was seen between the activity of other types of lectins 41 therefore they reported that two targets of possible antiviral intervention were identified in the replication cycle of sars-cov the first target is located early in the replication cycle most probably viral attachment and the second target is located at the end of the infectious virus cycle 41de clercq summarized various compounds which have been reported to exhibit in vitro activity against sars-cov though they have an ill-defined mode of action but selectivity indexes up to 100 valinomycin glycopeptide antibiotics plant lectins hesperetin glycyrrhizin aurintricarboxylic acid chloroquine niclosamide nelfinavir and calpain inhibitors among them plant lectins and chloroquine which is being discussed for the potential treatment of covid-19 are included 42this hypothesis has further been tested later in mers-cov epidemic because coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with the spike proteins present on their surface responsible for virus entry into the target cell 43 because mers-cov also cause a high mortality rate of about 35 no vaccine is available and therapeutic options for mers-cov infections are limited to palliative and supportive care a search for specific antiviral treatments was urgently needed 43 millet et al thought that lectins are attractive anti-coronavirus candidates because of the highly glycosylated nature of the spike protein and tested the antiviral effect of griffithsin grft a lectin isolated from the red marine alga griffithsia sp against mers-cov infection 43 they demonstrated that griffithsin is a potent inhibitor of mers-cov infection without significant cytotoxicity 43 griffithsin inhibited entry into host cells of particles pseudotyped with the mers-cov spike protein suggesting that griffithsin inhibits spike protein function during entry at the binding step 43the compounds found in elderberries are phenolic acids flavonoids vitamins lectins and aroma compounds etc 44 a very similar lectin called sambucus nigra fruit specific agglutinin i sna-if was identified as a minor protein in ripe elderberry fruits 45 although elderberry supplements have not been tested in the current covid-19 pandemic lectin components might inhibit spike protein function during entry at the binding step as mentioned above or have unknown other effectscurrently because anyone can buy elderberry supplements without a prescription as over-the-counter medicines if it does not cause any significant harm there is no reason not to use it and it can be applied at an early course of the disease although there have been some reports on the increase in some cytokines by elderberry supplements 46 elderberry supplements also have various kinds of other effects surely however we should also weigh the benefit and risk for the use of elderberry supplements like other otcs we know that even otcs eg tylenol have many adverse effects on the drug information in addition we should also look at the evidence-based systematic review of elderberry and elderflower sambucus nigra by the natural standard research collaboration 47 which could be applied to the current covid-19 pandemicin this point we should be able to guide the use of these elderberry supplements to the general population or patients with covid-19 as this elderberry supplements can be used in those with covid-19 at an early course of disease if you understand the previous efficacy of these and potential adverse effectsfourth the use of oral steroids should be actively considered at an early course of the disease if the cause of death of covid-19 is ards and organ failure due to cytokine storm by hyperactivated host immune response why we are not considering to suppress or prevent this process at an early course of the disease we think the increase in various pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 may be suppressed by short-course low dose steroids in an early stage of disease but it may not be effective in a later stage of disease such as ards and multiorgan failure this situation can be assimilated by forest fire if a first small fire by cigarette butts can be detected by hiker early early covid-19 it can be extinguished by small amounts of water low dose steroids easily but if wild forest fires spread persistent high fever dyspnea in the mountain without early suppression it cannot be suppressed despite every effort by numerous fire trucks long-term use of very high dose of steroids and all mountains will be burned destructed lung requiring ecmo there was one recent systematic review reporting that the use of steroids may be harmful to patients with covid-19 48 however this result should be interpreted with caution because the quality of the included studies is extremely low and they have many biases many studies are missing and the included studies are not on the use of steroids vs no use this result should not be generalized to the patients with early course of the disease and mild symptomsone study investigated the structural arrangement of n protein explaining the first steps of its interaction with nucleic acid at the initial stages of virus structure assembly 49 the nucleocapsid n protein of covid-19 has nearly 90 amino acid sequence identity with sars-cov and the n protein antibodies of sars-cov may cross react with covid-19 but may not provide cross-immunity in a similar fashion to sars-cov the n protein of covid-19 may play an important role in suppressing the rna interference rnai to overcome the host defense 50 in rat models the n-protein of sars-cov had pathogenicity and could induce obvious pulmonary inflammatory reaction and acute lung injury which were related to the increase and imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines 51 in this study glucocorticoids could effectively alleviate the pulmonary inflammatory reaction induced by n-protein of sars-cov supporting the beneficial role of steroids on the inflammatory reactions caused by n-protein of the current covid-19 51according to the chinese governments daily report 132213 of patients with covid-19 developed severe or fatal illness and therefore the chinas national health commission released the fifth trial version of diagnosis and treatment scheme for pneumonitis with covid-19 and provided a systematic treatment strategy for severe cases and systematic corticosteroids treatment methylprednisolone 12 mg per kg body weight for 35 days was recommended to be an adjuvant therapy 52 zou et al recently showed that systematic corticosteroids therapy in the first 35 days in severe patients could enhance oxygen saturation sao2 and arterial oxygen tension pao2inspiratory oxygen fraction fio2 but corticosteroids did not exert any intervention on survival of ncp patients complicated with both ards and shock or multiple organ injury 53 nevertheless they concluded that corticosteroids in the phase of ards would effectively inhibit furious inflammatory storm and gain valuable time for controlling infection and preventing secondary multiorgan damage and shock which implies that corticosteroids have synergistic biological effects when combined with other intensivists treatment against severe or fatal ncp patients 53 however as we mentioned above we think the increase in various pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 may be suppressed by short-course low dose steroids in an early stage of disease but it may not be effective in a later stage of disease such as ards and multiorgan failure because a later stage may be a big fire which cannot be suppressed easilyone another thing is a short course of low dose oral steroids is easily prescribed in the treatment of urticaria but why are we afraid of prescribing the use of oral steroids in the acute covid-19 setting even though many patients progress to severe disease in whom there will be some patients with mild symptoms with severe radiologic findings if we can lower the percentage of progressing to cytokine storm by early use of steroids even though it is found to be statistically nonsignificant such as p-value of 006009 several patients will be rescued therefore we should interpret the results based on the p-value cautiously and conversely misinterpretation or misunderstanding of p-value will cause a significant harm to the patients with covid-19 recently some groups showed the beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine 12 until these reports there was evidence of hydroxychloroquine on coronavirus just from in vitro study 5455 therefore the doctor who first used this drug in a patient with covid-19 might have done this treatment by non-evidence-based medicine we should try the oral steroids in patients with covid-19 at an early course of diseasefifth the use of oral antibiotics should be actively considered if the patient feels not good because secondary bacterial infection might aggravate acute immunological lung injury induced by several cytokines eg il-2 il-6 and tnf- in covid-19 there are no controlled clinical trials evaluating the use of empiric antimicrobials in covid-19 patients or other coronavirus driven diseases therefore recommendations can only be based on other viral diseases like influenza 56 furthermore another guideline on treating covid-19 patients was released both guidelines suggest that blind or inappropriate use of antibacterial drugs especially the combination of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs should be avoided in patients with mild or no symptoms 57 however we are against these guidelines because the current covid-19 situation is definitely different to other usual viral infections because some patients with mild symptoms can have severe radiologic features and sudden death furthermore bacterial superinfection is hard to detect and cannot be easily diagnosed symptoms of covid-19 and bacterial superinfection may overlap data on the prevalence of bacterial superinfection in patients with covid-19 are very limited 58 influenza pneumonia is often associated with staphylococcus aureus co-infection and can be especially virulent 56 initiating empiric antibacterial therapy in adults with community-acquired pneumonia who test positive for influenza was recommended by recent clinical practice guidelines 56 therefore we suggest that according to the clinical manifestations of patients if the accompanying bacterial infection cannot be ruled out patients can take antibacterial drugs against community-acquired pneumonia such as amoxicillin azithromycin or fluoroquinolones 57 empirical antibacterial treatment in severe patients should cover all possible pathogens deescalating therapy until the pathogenic bacteria are clarified 59in addition the current special situation should also be considered currently if the patient is diagnosed as having covid-19 heshe will be isolated at home and is recommended that if severe symptoms are developed come to the hospital and no medications are provided however we think this is a very dangerous situation because some persons might have no or only mild symptoms despite severe progression of lung injury and when these patients become to feel dyspnea and come to the hospital the time might be late for the recovery they will receive not only intravenous antibiotics but also various kinds of multiple drugs we speculate that many patients who became to get severe symptoms might have bacterial complications it has been reported that bacterial coinfection is associated with approximately 40 of viral respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization 60 the incidence of bacterial complications of covid-19 is unknown yet but considering that more patients with covid-19 get severe symptoms than observed in other respiratory viral diseases we speculate that more bacterial complications might be combined not only in severe conditions but also in mild conditions if the patient is having usual other respiratory viral infections heshe will visit the clinic and will be prescribed antibiotics however in the current situation the patient with covid-19 cannot visit an usual clinic and should wait until he will recover or get dyspnea if virus damages the throat or lungs other bacteria oral cavity can cause secondary infection and this cannot be exactly evaluated and diagnosed because the laboratory examinations for bacteria such as culture or procalcitonin may not be exact due to false negative and all the bacteria cannot be examinedin this situation based on the medical principle do no harm waiting until the patient deteriorate is a severe harm therefore to prevent the deterioration of the patient with covid-19 oral antibiotics and oral steroids should be given to the patient at the time of covid-19 and it should be recommended if the patient has high fever and feels bad take the antibiotics and steroids empirically and it can be acceptable in the pandemic era as many patients are dying due to complications of covid-19 if the doctor can monitor and guide the patients with phone calls it will be better if there are enough medical personnels so in the current situation liberal and early use of oral antibiotics and steroids may be do no harm which may be a different situation than during the usual common cold situation in our experiences if the patient feels bad earlier antibiotics and steroids are used the patients condition will recoversixth hydroxychloroquine can be used as a secondary drug in patients with worsening symptoms in covid-19 chloroquine and its metabolite hydroxychloroquine are antimalarial agents that have demonstrated antiviral effects on sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in vitro 5455 chloroquine had inhibitory effects for multiple rna viruses in vitro chloroquine showed no antiviral or clinical beneficial effects in treatment of dengue and chikungunya virus infections and as influenza prophylaxis 61 a news briefing suggested that its use in more than 100 patients showed that it was superior to the control in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings promoting a virus negative conversion and shortening the disease course but the data have not been published yet 62 a recent consensus document recommended chloroquine phosphate 500 mg twice daily for minimum of 5 days 63 another study found hydroxychloroquine more potent than chloroquine in vitro based on these data hydroxychloroquine for 4 days 400 mg twice daily after a loading dose of 400 mg was recommended 54 a recent systematic review found no published studies in covid-19 patients 64 furthermore adding azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine 600 mg daily treatment seemed to have a beneficial outcome in a small french cohort 12 however we should also be cautious in interpreting the results of hydroxychloroquine because the current situation is just based on the in vitro studies and small number of case series also the adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine should also be considered in this situation we think hydroxychloroquine should not be used as a routine treatment of covid-19 but if the condition of the patients worsens despite the use of steroids and antibiotics hydroxychloroquine can be used as a secondary drugseventh policy for the drug use should be changed to reduce the mortality of patients in usual situation the patient can visit the clinic frequently according to the condition therefore steroids and antibiotics can be given timely based on the judgement of doctors however this pattern of examination diagnosis and treatment cannot be done in this covid-19 era doctors prescriptions are surely important to diagnose and treat patients however as we mentioned above patients are just waiting for recovery or deterioration until severe symptoms and no treatment is done in the meanwhile if the patient is infected occur with covid-19 and gets fever and visit the different clinics the treatment will not be standardized among doctors if a doctor concerns for the fever and the nature of rapid deterioration in covid-19 he may use steroids and antibiotics early while other doctors may not if so we can make some guidelines for the practical use of antibiotics steroids and hydroxychloroquine for the patients to use these drugs these should also include the benefit and adverse effect for each drug the policy we are proposing is to give these drugs to the patients freely although the range of drug should also be more discussed in korea the diagnosis of covid-19 is being done by drive through our suggestion is to make another drive through place to give these drugs to the patients to avoid the dissemination of infection because if the infected patient go to the hospital for the treatment heshe can infect all other patients also it will be good if the drugs are given to the patient who is visiting the screening clinic for example at the time of drive through diagnosis and explain in detail the benefit and adverse effect for each drug and then the doctor can check the result for covid-19 and guides the patient for taking the drugs by phone calls also the patient can take these drugs at hisher judgement this concept is based on that 1 any treatment for covid-19 has not been established 2 even though the patient visits the doctor the treatment patterns will be all different among doctors 3 steroids have frequently been used in other mild diseases such as urticaria 4 because we do not exactly know the presence or absence of secondary infection when the patient get fever oral antibiotics for 34 days can be acceptable treatment in routine clinical practice further 5 hydroxychloroquine can also be given to the patients and it can be recommended that if the patients symptoms worsen despite the use of steroids and antibiotics heshe can take hydroxychloroquine after recognizing all the adverse effect of the drug but if the symptoms worsen the patient surely visit the hospital as wellcovid-19 is causing a severe public health emergency and the mortality is rapidly increasing all over the word in this era we suggested 7 recommendations to rescue the patients and to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to covid-19 based an immunological point of view table 2 ours may be personal opinions but we believe these may be beneficial to control these complications exerted by covid-19 in addition there will be more other or conflicting evidences and publications regarding our opinions however we would like to remind of the basic principle for the treatment of patients again but we often forget this do no harm we all should think deeply on what is harm and what is no harm in addition we would like to say again doing something is better than nothing in the acceptable level of clinical practice we hope that our opinions can be transferred to not only who and cdc but also clinicians researchers and many institutions and covid-19 could be finished as rapidly as possibleall authors made substantial

comprises two different conditions that may be difficult to distinguish from one another a primary form that occurs due to genetic disorders and a secondary form that is triggered by various infections autoimmuneautoinflammatory diseases or chemicals 1 2 recent reports suggest that the cytokine storm caused by the novel coronavirus infection covid-19 has significant similarities with the clinical and laboratory findings of this disorder due to the accelerated deterioration of patients general status hemophagocytic syndrome hps necessitates a timely diagnosis for the initiation of life-saving treatmenthps or hlh is an acute and rapidly progressive systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by cytopenia excessive cytokine production and hyperferritinemia common clinical manifestations of hlh are acute unremitting fever lymphadenopathy hepatosplenomegaly and multiorgan failure due to a massive cytokine release this clinical condition is considered as a cytokine storm syndrome hlh has primary and acquired secondary reactive forms its primary form is mostly seen in childhood and caused by various mutations with genetic inheritance and therefore is called familial hlh fhlh fig 1 secondary hlh shlh may be caused in the presence of an underlying disorder that is secondary to a malignant infectious or autoimmuneautoinflammatory stimulus 13 this clinical condition was first reported by scott et al in 1939 the first reported four cases were identified as atypical hodgkins lymphoma characterized by pronounced histiocytic erythro-phagocytosis in the bone marrow and cellular proliferation in the lymph nodes medulla of the spleen and the periportal area later scott et al named this clinical entity as histiocytic medullary reticulocytosis hmr because of the pronounced phagocytosis with intense hyperplasia in medullary areas in the light of the data obtained it was accepted as a well-differentiated reticulum cell sarcoma a malignant process until 1973 in 1991 it was designated as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis the term of macrophage activation syndrome mas was used first in 1993 in 1997 the hlh working group classified the hps into primary and secondary hlh 46in this review we aim to contribute to the rheumatologists awareness of the life-threatening rare complication of hlh the cytokine storm to prevent a possible misdiagnosis in the presence of the clinical and laboratory features of covid-19 resembling or mimicking to that of an underlying or a new-onset rheumatological condition we hope that this review will support the collaboration of the rheumatologist and hematologists with their colleagues who treat covid-19 patients in the first place such as the infectious disease specialists pneumologists or intensive care

the past 5 years and only limited numbers of earlier key references were selected this algorithm resulted in 3080 manuscripts and the addition of and covid-19 resulted in 115 publications of which 47 studies together with four sections of an online book were used in the final review only full-text manuscripts published in an english language peer-reviewed journal were included we used data only from the index papers for table creation and figuresabout a quarter of total phlh cases have a genetic transition and therefore it is advisable to question a history of consanguineous marriage infections especially viral frequently trigger an inappropriate cytotoxic immune response in the presence of some genetic conditions mutations in cd8t cells and natural killer nk cells homozygous compound heterozygous or digenic with heterozygous mutations in two different genes result in a loss of performance in the cytolytic pathway proteins such as prf1 stx11 unc13d and unc18-2 the pathogenesis of this syndrome is underlined by the activation and proliferation of t lymphocytes mainly cd8cytotoxic t cells and natural killer nk cells leading to over-activation and proliferation of macrophages resulting in the phagocytosis of bone marrow hematopoietic cells andor reticuloendothelial system cells in other organs with the hypersecretion of several cytokines including interferon-gamma ifn- interleukin il-1 il-6 il-18 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf 5 7 fig 3the most important immunological abnormality in primary or reactive hlh is the impaired cytotoxic cell function under normal physiological conditions when a virus-infected cell or tumor cell is encountered cd8 cytotoxic t cells nk and nkt cells release perforin a tetrameric protein that creates pores in the target cell facilitates the entry of granzymes and disrupts the target cells membrane containing cytolytic granules and granzymes proteins involved in triggering apoptosis in the target cell initiate cytolytic destruction of the target cell for this process to proceed normally perforin and granzymes must be structurally normal and properly distributed in the cell and packaged into granules then the content of these granules should enter the target cell via exocytosis through the immunological synapse between the cytotoxic cell and its target disruption of this process with genetic mutations leads to the development of primary or familial hlh under normal conditions perforin and granzymes contribute to the destruction of target cells and the elimination of the immune-activating stimulus this eventually results in apoptosis of cytotoxic cells together with reduced antigen stimulation this physiological downregulation called activation-induced cell death is critical for the control of the immune response failure to clear the antigenic stimulus for any reason results in persistence and strengthening of the immune response immune activation is further driven by the high levels of macrophage activation with proinflammatory cytokines released by activated immune cells resulting in hemophagocytosis tissue damage organ failure and other inflammatory symptoms of the syndrome 2 4 8 9 numerous serum proinflammatory cytokine levels including il-1 il-2 il-6 il-12 il-16 il-18 tnf-documentclass12ptminimal

				begindocumentalphait enddocument and ifn- were found to be significantly high in hlh patients sera the patients prognosis worsens as the levels of these cytokines increase inability to clear antigenic stimulation of certain infections malignant or autoimmuneautoinflammatory processes leads to an inappropriate immune stimulation and a self-sustaining hyper-inflammatory condition known as the cytokine storm characterized by excessive and persistent high cytokines levels listed above 9 hlh may be classified as a cytokine storm syndrome in the presence of the intense and rapid cytokine elevation cytokine storm has emerged as an important under-recognized cause of death in covid-19 10 11 high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines have also been observed in hlh especially the overproduction of il-10 indicating a mechanism albeit insufficient to suppress the hyperactivation of th1 cells and monocytemacrophage functions in patients with this disease 9 the source of il-10 probably is the hemophagocytes and this may imply that hemophagocytosis is a compensatory reaction to hlh 12 13 in phlh and related immunodeficiency syndromes the inheritance of defective genes involved in the control of cytolysis eg prf1 stx11 unc13d unc18-2 leads to the uncontrolled proliferation and survival of cd8 t cells by impairing the cytolytic activity of cytotoxic t lymphocytes 5 7 children with certain immunodeficiency syndromes such as chdiak-higashi syndrome hermansky-pudlak syndrome type ii griscelli syndrome partial albinism x-linked lymphoproliferative disease xmen disease itk interleukine-2-inducible t cell kinase deficiency lysinuric protein intolerance cd27 deficiency and chronic granuloma also possess genetic defects associated with impaired cytolysis and are at risk of developing familial hlh specific x-linked immune deficiencies such as signaling lymphocytic activation molecule associated protein sap and x-linked apoptosis inhibitor xiap deficiency are also associated with hlh triggered by the epsteinbarr virus ebv 3 5 14 phlh is a rare 150000 of all live births condition and usually develops in the very first years of life it should be kept in mind that phlh as accepted widely as a pediatric disease may develop its first symptoms in adulthood patients with shlh may have cytolytic genes with underlying hypomorphic defects found in phlh as well indeed up to 40 of shlh and mas patients are reported to carry heterozygous some dominant-negative mutations of known familial hlh genes therefore some researchers suggest that mas shlh and familial hlh may be considered as members of a disease spectrum 3 5 7 it is an interesting finding that the prevalence of some mutations differs in certain populations such as those who are linked to perforin mutations that are more common in turks 15 16on the other hand unlike primary hlh patients observed differences in the pattern of t lymphocyte activation and differentiation in shlh patients may imply differences in the pathogenesis of these two conditions for example amman et al demonstrated that the expression of hla dr4 and perforin in activated cd8 t cells were higher in genetically predisposed hlh patients 17 it has been shown that lymphomas resulting in shlh produce proinflammatory cytokines that initiate and permanently stimulate the activation of cytotoxic t lymphocytes and nk cells as the triggers of this syndrome epsteinbarr virus ebv is the most common infectious trigger for both primary and secondary hlh an interesting finding in this association is that ebv which normally infects b lymphocytes can also infect cd8 cytotoxic t lymphocytes resulting in ebv-associated hlh 4secondary forms of hlh can be triggered by infections malignancies autoimmuneautoinflammatory diseases and medications most frequently shlh is triggered by infections termed as hlh-associated with infection in some cases a history of traveling is present in particular infectious of especially ebv and other members of the herpesvirus family hiv bacteria and fungi are the triggers of this clinical picture malignancies especially leukemia or lymphoma termed as hlh-associated with malignancy are among common triggers 14 hlh which develops in association with an autoimmuneautoinflammatory rheumatological disease is often referred to as mas and will be discussed in detail below however it is worth pointing out that some authors prefer to use the term mas for secondary hlh interestingly secondary hlh may arise iatrogenically due to drugs used in the treatment of the primary disease in 2014 ramos-callas et al reported in a meta-analysis of 775 hlh cases that the disease was more frequent in japan france china south korea taiwan italy spain and turkey 1 infections and drugs were the most common reported causes in adults while at least 30 had three or more possible triggering factors the distribution of the causes varied between countries malignancies were the leading cause in japan s korea taiwan china france and italy whereas autoimmune diseases were more frequent in spain and the usasecondary hlh which develops in the context of rheumatological diseases is often referred to as mas and is reported most frequently in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis sjia still disease patients 5 strippoli et al suggested a trilayer mechanism for the hlh that is secondary to rheumatic diseases firstly a genetic tendency such as defects in the cytotoxic activity of cd8 and nk cells and a genetic predisposition to tlr hyper-response followed by a high disease activity caused by the high proinflammatory state mediated by the high levels of cytokines such as il-6 and finally the activation of immune cells such as the t cells and macrophages triggered by a viral infection that leads to the cytokine storm 19up to 10 of sjia cases develop mas in adults it is reported in association with cases of adult onset still disease aosd and to a lesser extent in systemic lupus erythematosus sle cases mas is a not well known but life-threatening complication of these rheumatic diseases similar to sjia 10-15 of aosd patients develop mas the activation of shared innate immunopathogenic pathways including il-1 and il-18 leads to a similar systemic inflammation in both aosd and sjia therefore it is not surprising that mas is a common complication of both diseases 20 21 this hypothesis is supported by the observation that gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the innate immune protein nlrc4 promote the spontaneous formation of the nlrc4 inflammasome production of il-1 family cytokines il-1 and il-18 and inflammatory cell death in autoinflammatory diseases complicated by mas 22 similar to sjia mas in aosd may either occur at onset ora later stage mostly triggered by viral infections 23 in some patients mas may lead to ards and death in the course of covid-19 infection 10 24 25 therefore mas should be kept in mind in a covid-19 patient with signs of rapid clinical and laboratory deterioration every rheumatologist should be alert because of the cytokine storm a severe complication of covid-19 and symptoms of covid-19 such as fever arthralgia and myalgia resembling those seen during several rheumatologic diseases 26mas occurring in the early stages of aosd is characterized by neutrophilic leucocytosis and this laboratory finding may be used in the differential diagnosis later in the course of aosd mas may coincide with disease flares infections or the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as sulfasalazine methotrexate hydroxychloroquine and anti-tnf agents secondary hlh mas is characterized by fever pulmonary insufficiency liver failure neurological symptoms and signs of pancytopenia and coagulopathy that could not be explained for any other reason instead of a fever that rises typically in the afternoons with chills in aosd unremitting fever is more common in the presence of mas therefore persistent fever despite the treatment of infections that develops in the course of sjia or aosd should raise the suspicion of mas 27 28 pulmonary involvement is found in about half of shlh patients and patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which requires mechanical ventilation ards has a poor prognosis and is more common in severe shlh requiring intensive care 29 neurological involvement is a sign of poor prognosis as well and is usually a sign of established shlh several clinical signs and symptoms of cns involvement ranging from mood and personality changes to seizures muscle weakness in the extremities cranial nerve palsy decreased consciousness and coma may develop acute renal failure necessitating chronic renal replacement may be seen and worsens the outcome 3033 in aosd and mas cases leukocyte and platelet count hemoglobin albumin and fibrinogen levels are significantly lower than non-mas aosd cases however ferritin ldh and triglyceride levels which develops due to tnf suppression of lipoprotein lipase are significantly higher in patients with mas 5 27 here serum ferritin levels are of critical value in diagnosis the probability of mas at levels below 500 ngml is rather weak while the probability of mas increases for values between 500 and 1000 a value of 10000 ngml 10000 l or higher has a 96 specificity and 90 sensitivity for the presence of mas ferritin is the most dynamic test that rises rapidly and extensively in the early inflammatory period and decreases significantly with active treatment and cessation of the inflammation the ratio between baseline and recovery may reach 1800 high levels persisting despite active treatment or a decline of less than 50 is associated with a poor prognosis pre- and posttreatment levels of the laboratory parameters such as d-dimer triglycerides platelet levels ldh and transaminases differ as much as about 50 and may be useful in the diagnosis the presence of hyperferritinemia in association with cytopenia in various series low levels of fibrinogen due to the procoagulant effects of tnf or increased lysis and the absence of a significant increase in sedimentation despite the increased crp may be used to support the diagnosis of mas 34 thrombocytopenia and hypofibrinogenemia can lead to ecchymoses and bleeding especially in critical cases since hemophagocytosis is a late-stage finding it may not be detected in early bone marrow examinations bone marrow findings may not correlate with clinical symptoms or high ferritin levels and are therefore not essential for diagnosis 30 34 one should not wait for hemophagocytosis to be proven to initiate treatment but a bone marrow biopsy when available is necessary since hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow may support the therapy when presentscd25 as a marker of t cell activation and scd163 as the marker of hemophagocytosis are specific markers for hlh however the aforementioned parameters are not included in the mas classification criteria made for sjia due to difficulties in their routine use 35 but the hlh-2004 criteria include scd25 sil2r  2400 uml 34in summary it is crucial to exclude hlhmas in sjia aosd and when patients with covid-19 suddenly deteriorate in the presence often remitting high fever additional pulmonary andor neurological symptoms cytopenia and abnormal ferritin or ldh levels 24 25 36a timely diagnosis of hlh is of particular importance because patients may be critically ill and delay in diagnosis contributes only to a poor outcomethe diagnosis is based mainly on clinical and laboratory criteria there is no single laboratory test or clinical finding that is pathognomonic the widely used hlh-2004 criteria set is developed by the histiocyte society table 1 37this score is developed to estimate the individuals risk of reactive hps for both primary and secondary hlh clinical and laboratory features scored are given in table 1 28 for this scoring the following nine variables are used three clinical variables underlying immunosuppression high fever organomegaly five biochemical variables triglycerides ferritin serum transaminases fibrinogen presence of cytopenia and one cytological findings of hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow table 1 the median score for patients with a positive phlh diagnosis was 230 interquartile range iqr 203257 and 125 iqr 91150 for patients with a negative diagnosisthe probability of suffering from hps was less than 1 for an hs score of  90 and 99 for an hscore of  250 a cutoff of 169 had 93 sensitivity and 86 specificity for hlh note that bone marrow hemophagocytosis is not mandatory for an hlh diagnosis this scoring system is available online for general use httpsaintantoineaphpfrscore ferritin values have prognostic value in septic patients additionally 29a belgian group addressed this issue in detail at the onset of the disease hscore was more effective than the hlh-2004 criteria in accurately identifying hlh for both children and adults diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 100 and 80 for children and 90 and 79 for adults respectively hscores performance dropped to levels similar to the hlh-2004 criteria with 73 accuracy for the same specificity once the patients clinical condition worsens the authors concluded that hscore for children is generally more useful than the hlh-2004 criteria and for adults hscore is most useful only at the patients initial presentation the authors also concluded that the originally published cut-off value of 169 should optimally be adapted according to the target patient group of interest 38 another group addressed this issue in rheumatological diseases and proposed an adopted cut-off value for a target population with various rheumatological diseases in a cohort of 94 patients with rheumatological diseases 30 with hlh and 64 controls the optimal cut-off value was found to be 1905 sensitivity 967 and specificity 984 39although both shlhmas and phlh are life-threatening conditions the mortality rate in patients with phlh is much higher before the era of treatment protocols involving aggressive chemotherapy and immunosuppression only 5 of phlh patients survived 1 year after diagnosis therefore it is extremely important to start the hlh-2004 treatment protocol containing etoposide in patients with phlh immediately yet most patients with phlh need hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as the final treatment 3 in contrast the treatment of shlhmas depends on the clinical severity and may either be treated with a moderate increase in the corticosteroid dosage or aggressive immunosuppressives drugs may be favored as the first therapeutic approach 8for these reasons it is important to differentiate phlh from phlhmas as early as possible however the diagnostic work-up required for phlh takes time and may not be readily performed everywhere in this instance some clinical and laboratory features gain importance in a known sjia patient the clinical diagnosis of mas is relatively simple in the presence of typical clinical features but when mas coincides with the onset of sjia it may be substantially more difficult to distinguish mas from phlh according to data from a large series of international mas cases in sjia patients approximately 23 of reported mas episodes occurred at the onset of sjia and mimicked the characteristics of the underlying disease 40 the first attempt to determine the laboratory properties that will separate mas from phlh was performed by lehmberg et al 18 an important issue of this report is that in 70 of mas patients included in this study clinical manifestations of mas appeared before the diagnosis of sjia neutrophil counts and crp were significantly higher in massjia patients and high levels of sil2ra were observed more frequently in phlh minoia et al proposed a more sophisticated composite score to distinguish better between phlh and mas the macrophage activation syndromehemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis mh score the creation of the mh score is based on a much larger data set 362 patients with mas and 258 patients with hlh the mh score consists of six demographic clinical and laboratory variables age of onset neutrophil count fibrinogen level presence of splenomegaly platelet count and hemoglobin level a multivariate analysis was done to assess the weight of each variable for its contribution to the diagnosis of phlh the mh score was initially developed based on the data of 80 of patients and then validated using the data of the remaining 20 of the patients mh score performed extremely well in the validation in this study the mh score ranged from 0 to 123 and the median value was 97 1st3rd quartile 75123 and 12 1st3rd quartile 1134 in phlh and mas respectively the probability of receiving a diagnosis of phlh was less than one percent for a score of less than one and 99 for a score of  123 the cut-off value of  60 had the best performance in separating phlh from mas 41 however for cases other than sjia such as sle or kawasaki disease where cytopenia and liver enzyme elevations may also be related to the activity of the underlying diseases the discriminatory value may be lower in this case it is advisable to make a decision based on the patients history clinical complaints and response to treatmentthese are the criteria developed by ravelli et al to overcome some difficulties encountered in the diagnosis of mas developing in sjia cases table 1 an important difference from hlh-2004 is the absence of scd25 measurement the calculated sensitivity and specificity of this classification set was 73 and 99 respectively 35the hlh2004 criteria set is a reliable tool in the diagnosis of hlh the hscore estimates best the risk of hlh and the mh score differentiates reliably between mas and phlh in pediatric cases hscore is more accurate when used at the onset of the disease in adult patients but cut-off values recommended for hscore may vary depending on the underlying disease it is advisable to use the 2016 classification criteria to assess mas in the course of sjiaas described above hlh is a life-threatening medical condition early diagnosis and rapid intervention are life-saving it should be noted that the shlh-cytokine storm may be the main reason for the rapid deterioration seen in a covid-19 patientdespite treatment with the hla-2004 protocol most patients with phlh need an allogeneic stem cell transplant secondary forms and mas rarely necessitate transplantation in these cases triggering factors such as infection malignancy and medication should be searched for remission is possible with a combined immunosuppressive treatment in shlhmas cases early use of high-dose steroids can be successful alone but more than half of reported adult cases are steroid-resistant unlike phlh patients rarely need hemopoietic stem cell transplantation due to mas developing as a result of severe sjia 42 carter et al favor an immediate treatment with 1 g of intravenous methylprednisolone per day for 35 days combined with ivig 1 gkg for 2 days consider repeating every 14 days due to its half-life of 1421 days as the first-line treatment of shlh 23 the emergence of established hlh features or clinical deterioration despite treatment may necessitate the early initiation of the il-1 blocker anakinra 23 in our personal experience when caught early in the course the patient often relieves with the elimination of the triggering factors such as medication and a medium dose of corticosteroid therapy evidence in sjia-related mas suggests that early use of anakinra and il-1 blockade would also be beneficial in the adult mas population anakinra is effective in mas treatment when corticosteroids ivig cyclosporin and etoposide fail to control the disease for most of the time only in combination with corticosteroids 43 it is encouraging that the use of anakinra is associated with an improved outcome in patients with sepsis and mas features and gives an appropriate signal for safe use in the context of shlh even when triggered by infection 44 in refractory mas cases doses of 100 mg anakinra four times a day may be required to achieve remission 45 anakinra is safely used in the treatment of autoinflammatory diseases such as sjia and fmf in rheumatology outpatient clinicssome studies of anakinra canakinumab and rilonacept reported that il-1 blockade alone is not sufficient to prevent mas in the course of sjia in these studies corticosteroids cyclosporin andor other drugs had to be added to treat mas patients 23 interestingly tocilizumab is useful in the treatment of hlh however mas has also been reported in patients receiving tocilizumab in these cases clinical and laboratory findings of mas such as lower ferritin levels frequency of hepatomegaly and normal crp may become less subtle under tocilizumab treatment 46 the cytokine storm seen in the course of covid-19 is effectively treated with tocilizumab or anakinra 11 47rituximab may have a place in the treatment in combination with other drugs and has been shown to reduce ebv viral load serum ferritin levels and to improve the overall clinical outcome in patients with ebv-related hlh 18 already the first cases of mas in association with covid-19 cases treated successfully with jak inhibitors such as baricitinib and il-1 or il-6 blockers are accumulating 47hlh may be triggered by genetic conditions infections including covid-19 malignancies autoimmune-autoinflammatory diseases and some drugs hlh should be suspected in patients with unexplained progressive fever cytopenia ards neurological and renal impairment differentiation between the primary and secondary forms of hlh is utterly important since primary forms of hlh require complicated treatments such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as the covid-19 pandemic develops large numbers of patients with rare complications of viral infections such as hlh accumulate increasing cases of covid-19 and its severe complications such as the cytokine storm and hlh may necessitate a closer collaboration of rheumatologists and hematologists with intensive care physicians infectious disease specialists and pneumologists who are more likely to treat these patients in the first place early recognition of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and its severe complication of cytokine storm is possible only using the diagnostic sets of criteria and by knowing their shortcomings and advantages in specific patient groups further studies addressing the performance of these criteria sets in the diagnosis in the setting of covid-19 is necessarysevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged from wuhan china has now become a threat to the whole world the disease associated with sars-cov-2 is termed as coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 world health organization who has now declared covid-19 as a global pandemic affecting more than 200 countries resulting in 1991562 confirmed cases and 130 885 deaths as of 16 april 2020 and still counting 1 the main reason for disease severity in covid-19 is due to aberrant and excessive cytokine production leading to pathophysiology called cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 24 the serum of infected patients showed increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-2 tnf- il-1 ifn- mcp-1 and mip1a resulting in cytokine storm 4 building on the above observation these patients were given corticosteroids to reduced inflammation-induced lung damage however previous studies with the influenza virus suggest that adjunctive corticosteroid therapy rather increase mortality also corticosteroid therapy in patients with middle east respiratory syndrome mers resulted in delayed viral clearance 5 altogether suggesting the cautious use of corticosteroids in covid-19 patients hence due to the limited effectiveness of corticosteroids the use of alternate immuno-modulators could be suggested at presentbefore the emergence of novel sars-cov-2 in late 2019 mers-cov and sars-cov were considered to be highly pathogenic these two cov contribute to acute lung pathology as a result of cytokine storm in infected patients which could be lethal if left untreated 6 the earlier study with sars-cov infection in non-human primates cynomolgus macaques resulted in increased expression of ifn- ifn- and ifn-  ifn- at mrna level in lungs of the infected macaque 7 similarly sars-cov infection in balbc mice showed increase pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion eventually leading to lethal acute lung injury and high fatality rate in mice 8 mouse model of mers coronavirus cov infection demonstrated enhanced expression of ccl2 il-6 and tnf- at mrna level in the lungs of infected mice comparative in-vitro infection studies with sars-cov and mers-cov showed that both these viruses upregulated the expression of tnf- il-6 and il-12 at mrna level in monocytes derived macrophages 9in context to sars-cov-2 reports are emerging from china the epicenter of covid-19 which showed a similar trend in cytokine profile as with sars-cov and mers-cov 10 in severe cases of covid-19 patients showed increased serum cytokine levels of il-2 tnf-  il-1 ifn- mcp-1 mip1a and il-6 4 11 another life-threatening complication namely ards could be developed more often in elderly covid-19 patients as a result of cytokine storm 4 12 13 according to recent research patients with ards have reduced serum s1p levels as compared to healthy controls which was further associated with non-pulmonary organ failure 14 in this context detection of serum s1p level in covid-19 patients may be worth exploring as it serves as a biomarker for ards associated disease severitywe have earlier reported therapeutic intervention of using s1p sphingosine-1-phosphate analogs during infectious diseases 15 16 our unpublished study with s1p analogs in mycobacterium tuberculosis h37ra infected macrophages showed that treatment with s1p analogs results in blunting too much pro-inflammatory response but also intriguingly leading to clearance of bacterial load additionally s1p signaling was reviewed as a potential target to provide therapeutic benefits in pulmonary disorder 17 as with h1n1 influenza virus infection intra-tracheal aal-r r-2-amino-4-4-heptyloxyphenyl-2-methylbutanol s1p analog the treatment showed improved survivability of mice challenged with h1n1 as compared to conventional antiviral therapy walsh et al provide evidence that intra-tracheal administration with aal-r in infected mice resulted in reduced lung tissue injury as showed by histo-pathological and enzymatic studies 18 the bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid of these mice revealed reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines such as ifn- il-6 and ifn- and chemokine including ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 cxcl2 and cxcl10 aal-r treatment doesnt clear the viral load nevertheless it doesnt impair host ability to clear viral load which was supported by the unchanged viral neutralizing antibodies in treated and untreated groups 18 similarly rp-002 treatment functional agonists of s1pr1 reduced mortality of influenza virus-infected mice by reduction in cytokinechemokines ifn- ccl2 il-6 and ifn- production 19 the same group later studies the efficacy of rp-002 in a mouse model of the respiratory syncytial virus oral administration of rp-002 showed enhanced survival of paramyxovirus pmv infection in mice as displayed by reduced inflammation in lungs with normal morphology of alveolar sacs of infected mice on rp-002 therapy decrease ifn- tnf-  ccl2 ccl5 cxcl10 il-1 and il-6 secretion was also observed in bal fluid of rp-002 treated infected mice 20 the authors further revealed that rp-002 treatment reduced cd8 t and natural killer nk cells in the lung infiltrate of infected mice lesser number of tnf- and il-2 producing ifn- cd8 t cells after stimulated with immuno-dominant peptides of pmv was further confirmed in the lymph nodes and lungs of infected mice as compared to mice that received vehicle 20 the previous study with sars-cov demonstrates the infiltration of cd8 t cell and nk cells in the lungs of infected mice at the late phase of the infection surprisingly instead of cd8 t cells cd4 t cells were required for viral clearance whereas cd8 t cells were rather associated with lung pathology during viral infection 21 hence here it is suggested that s1p analogs may block the infiltration of immune cells with inflammatory phenotype particularly cd8 t cells secreting tnf- or ifn- which may prevent acute lung injury during covid-19a more recent study by zhao et al presented a similar approach of s1pr1 agonist cym5542 in providing therapeutic benefits in h1n1 infected mice intra-tracheal delivery of cym5542 results in a marked reduction in lung injury and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokines production such as ifn- ifn- tnf- il-6 ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 cxcl2 and cxcl10 in bal fluid of infected mice furthermore the therapeutic efficacy of cym5542 was improved in the presence of an antiviral drug oseltamivir 22 as s1p signaling influences myriad of downstream signaling the role of cym5542 in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells nfb was studied cym5542 treatment results in the reduced phosphorylation status of mapk such as erk12 and jnk12 and p65 subunit of nfb resulting in inactivation of the signal and hence cytokine production 22 cym5542 treatment resulted in the degradation of interferon alpha receptor 1 ifnar1 and deactivation signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 stat1 thereby limiting ifn-  response 23before recommending s1p as a potential therapy against covid-19 we must also discuss the possible risk associated with s1p analogs the common consequence of cytokine storm is acute lung injury that results in ards which proves to be fatal as seen in severe cases of sars-cov-2 infected patients hence it is very critical to maintain cytokine homeostasis in response to pulmonary infection by targeting pro-inflammatory immune cells or activating anti-inflammatory pathways 24 however targeting pro-inflammatory immune cells may not be an advisable approach as it also limits the capacity of the host to clear the infection therefore cautious use of s1p analogs in combination with anti-viral therapy is suggested to ensure clearance of infection without compromising the host defense it is also worth noting that activation of s1p signaling during m tuberculosis infection has dual action of host protection or disease progression which depends on stage of m tuberculosis infection s1p treatment during early infection has profound effect on reduction of infection and disease associated histopathology on the contrary s1p treatment during acute m tuberculosis infection exacerbates the disease 25 therefore to explore proper therapeutic potential of s1p analogs all these criteria must be taken into consideration more importantly s1p analogs have shown therapeutic efficacy in animal model of pulmonary infections its role in humans has not been studied yet most of the human trials related to s1p analogs as immunotherapy have been dedicated to diseases such as multiple sclerosis subacute lupus erythematosus crohns disease etc 26 as of now only fingolimod fty720 s1p analog has been recently approved for clinical trials to test its efficacy against covid-19 however due to the broad specificity of fty720 on s1pr1 and s1pr3-5 more specific s1p analogs such as rp-002 or cym5542 must also be investigated to minimize off-target effectssars-cov-2 induced cytokine storm is a serious immuno-pathology that could lead to the death of infected patients s1p analogs have earlier protected from pulmonary infection by dampening the cytokine storm table 1 taken together these reports emphasize the need to consider s1p analogs as potential immuno-modulators in ameliorating sars-cov-2 induced cytokine storm several studies correlated cytokine storm with lung pathophysiology and have advocated the use of immuno-modulators for therapeutic intervention 27 in this regard a fda approved drug for multiple sclerosis fty720 which is a s1pr modulator is recently in the clinical trial to assess its role as an immuno-modulator in covid-19 28 as a new vaccine and anti-viral for the treatment of covid-19 may take more time alternatively host-directive therapy could be the current weapon of choice against sars-cov-2 29 of note dampening of sars-cov-2 induced cytokine storm with s1p analogs warrants further attention in the form of more robust and randomized clinical trials to prove our hypothesisall datasets presented in this study are included in the articlesupplementary materialall authors listed have made a substantial direct and intellectual contribution to the work and approved it for publicationthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestcoronaviruses a genus of the coronaviridae family are enveloped viruses with a large plus-strand ribonucleic acid rna genome 1 the genomic rna is 2732 kb in size capped and polyadenylated coronaviruses were identified in several non-human species including rats mice chickens cattle turkeys swine cats dogs rabbits and horses in these species coronavirus infection often causes devastating epizootics of respiratory or enteric diseases several coronaviruses such as hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 were identified since the mid-1960s prior to the sars-cov outbreak coronaviruses were only thought to cause mild self-limiting respiratory infections in humans commonly referred at as colds these viruses are endemic among the human populations causing 1530 of respiratory tract infections each year rarely these viruses can cause lower respiratory tract infections especially in neonates in the elderly and in individuals with underlying illnessessars-cov a novel coronavirus was identified in 2002 as the pathogenic agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak that occurred in in the guangdong province of china 2 so far sars is the most severe human disease caused by a coronavirus recent evidence confirmed that the sars-cov virus originated from a mutation occurring in a non-human host probably bats gains the ability to affect humans luckily the transmission of sars-cov was relatively inefficient since its spread occurred only through direct contact with infected individuals with negligible infectivity during incubation state the outbreak was largely contained within households and healthcare settingsa novel human coronavirus named middle east respiratory syndrome-cov mers-cov emerged in the middle east in 2012 as the causative agent of a series of highly pathogenic respiratory tract infections in saudi arabia and other countries in the middle east 3 in the early stages of the outbreak a high mortality rate of 50  was reported but the outbreak did not accelerate through 2013 and by the end of 2014 it was largely controlled also for this virus a zoonotic origin is suspected since dromedary camels may be its natural hostsin early december 2019 several pneumonia cases of unknown origin were observed in wuhan china the pathogen was identified as a novel enveloped rna  coronavirus that was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 4 the virus showed phylogenetic similarities to both sars-cov and mers-cov viruses in view of its similarities to bat coronaviruses it was postulated that bats could have been the primary hosts of sars-cov-2 this hypothesis suggested that the infection originated via transmission from wild animals illegally sold in the huanan seafood wholesale market on january 30th 2020 the world health organization who declared coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern and on march 11th who director general referred to covid-19 as a pandemic as of may 5th 2020 the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 has exceeded 3 million worldwide with more than 250000 covid-19-related deaths the epidemic has put public health systems under severe strain both in western countries and in the developing world sars-cov-2 displays a more efficient transmission pattern when compared with sars-cov and mers-cov 5 retaining a high transmission rate also in the asymptomatic incubation period 6 the clinical spectrum of covid-19 syndrome varies remarkably going from asymptomatic forms to acute bilateral pneumonias requiring hospitalization common presenting symptoms include fever fatigue and dry cough while laboratory tests often show lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels chest computed tomographic scans show a typical pattern of bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity a significant percentage of cases requires admission to intensive-care-units icu due to acute respiratory distress syndrome that requires mechanical ventilation support a subgroup of patients with severe covid-19 can experience the so-called cytokine storm syndrome characterized by a fulminant and fatal hyper-cytokinemia associated with multi-organ failurethe term cytokine storm has become increasingly used not only by authors of scientific articles but also by popular media it is likely that the widespread use of this term is related with its rather immediate meaning which actually recalls the role of the immune system in producing an uncontrolled and generalized inflammatory response 7 it seems not casual that the term cytokine storm was first employed in describing the events modulating the onset of the graft-versus-host disease 8 a condition characterized by an impressively powerful activation of the immune system cytokine storms characterize a wide spectrum of infectious and non-infectious diseases and since 2005 it was associated to the avian h5n1 influenza virus infection 9 apart from the immediate significance of the term cytokine storm the biological and clinical consequences of this immune system hyperactivity are by far less known making it worthwhile to be briefly overviewedthere are several similarities in the clinical features between covid-19 and previously identified beta-coronavirus infections shared clinical findings include that most patients present with fever dry cough dyspnea and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest ct scans 10 however the physiopathology of the mechanisms through which sars-cov or mers-cov sustain high pathogenicity are yet to be completely unveiledsince the first reports on covid-19 disease it appeared clear that acute respiratory distress syndrome ards accounted for a significant number of deaths among infected patients and that ards should be regarded as the hallmark immune-mediated clinical consequence in sars-cov-2 similarly to what described for sars-cov and mers-cov infections11 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is a devastating event with an estimated mortality of approximately 40 defined as the presence of bilateral lung infiltrates and severe hypoxemia ards can occur in a variety of clinical situations including pneumonia sepsis pancreatitis blood transfusion ards pathogenesis involves inflammatory injury to the alveolocapillary membrane which results in increased lung permeability and the exudation of protein-rich pulmonary edema fluid into the airspaces leading in the end to respiratory insufficiency 12as shown by previous data in the literature increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines eg interferon  interleukin il- 1b il-6 il-12 and chemokines cxcl10 and ccl2 are associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung involvement in sars patients similarly to what happens in mers-cov infection 13 as far as covid 19 infection is concerned huang et al recently reported that infected patients also show high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 4 the demonstration of increased levels of il-1b ifn cxcl10 and ccl2 strongly pointed toward an activation of t-helper-1 th1 cell function more importantly the so called cytokine storm emerged as a main factor driving a more severe clinical course this concept originated from the observation that covid-19 patients requiring icu admission displayed higher concentrations of cxcl10 ccl2 and tnf as compared to those in which the infection was less severe and did not require an icu admission to further complicate the issue it should be highlighted that in patients with sars-cov-2 infection at difference from sars-cov infection there is also an increased secretion th2-immune-oriented cytokines such as il-4 and il-10 whose main effect is to suppress inflammation14taken together these data clearly indicate that in sars-cov infection ards is the ultimate result of a cytokine storm in this scenario the release by immune effector cells of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn ifn il-1 il-6 il-12 il-18 il-33 tnf tgf and chemokines cxcl10 cxcl8 cxcl9 ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 precipitates and sustains the aberrant systemic inflammatory response 4131516 the cytokine storm is readily followed by the immune system attacking the body which in turn will cause ards and multiple organ failure the final result being death at least in the most severe cases of sars-cov-2 infection 11the cytokine storm and the consequent ards results from the effects of a combination of many immune-active molecules interferons interleukins chemokines colony-stimulating factors and tnf-alpha represent the main components involved in the development of the cytokine storm and will be briefly overviewed- interferons a family of cytokines with a central role in virus-directed innate immunity binds specific receptors and result in the expression of genes encoding protein with anti-viral or immunomodulatory properties this sequence of events supported the therapeutic use of ifns in some viral diseases such as chronic hepatitis but also in non-viral conditions including leukemia and lymphoma melanoma and multiple sclerosis 1718- tumor necrosis factor  tnf is a pyrogen cytokine released from immune cells in the acute phase of inflammation and infection it is a central cytokine in viral diseases and is associated with a number of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 19- colony-stimulating factors csf these proteins are associated with inflammatory conditions and are components of an amplification cascade which ultimately increases cytokine production by macrophages at sites of inflammation this effect perpetuates the inflammatory reaction 20- interleukins are a family of cytokines involved in immune cells differentiation and activation they mediate the traffic of immune cells to the site of the infection induce the increase of the acute phase signaling activate epithelial cells and mediate the production of secondary cytokines 21 among them interleukin-6 il-6 deserves a more extensive discussion in view of its involvement in the coronavirus-induced cytokine storm il-6 is crucially involved in acute inflammation due to its role in regulating the acute phase response 21 it is produced by almost all stromal cells and b lymphocytes t lymphocytes macrophages monocytes dendritic cells mast cells and other non-lymphocytic cells such as fibroblasts endothelial cells keratinocytes glomerular mesangial cells and tumor cells 22 the production of this cytokine is increased by il-1 and tumor necrosis factor tnf- 23 il-6 may also be responsible for the activation of t helper 17 th17 cells in the dendritic cell-t cell interaction 24 in covid-19 affected patients a high th17 cells activation could result from a virus-driven increased production of il-6 by the immune system il-6 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the cytokine storm owing to its pleiotropic properties several studies showed that the serum levels of il-6 are increased in covid-19 patients and that its circulating levels are positively related to disease severity 142526 for this reason high serum il-6 levels were suggested as predictors for disease severity 2728 indeed in animal models of sars-cov infection the inhibition of the transcription factor of il-6 and in turn of its production was associated with reduced mortality 29during the present covid-19 pandemic the use of tocilizumab as a therapeutic agent was proposed tocilizumab is a humanized anti-il-6 receptor igg1 monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseases 14 by blocking the il-6-receptor interaction tocilizumab inhibits the il-6-mediated signal transduction although clinical data on the use of tocilizumab in covid-19 patients derive from small series some authors recommend its use in critically ill covid-19 patients with significantly elevated il-6 levels 14
-chemokines are a large family of cytokines characterized by a powerful chemotactic effect chemokinesact as chemo-attractants in the migration of the immune system cells but they are also involved in several other processes including the development and function of innate and adaptive immune system embryogenesis and cancer metastasis 3031 they are promptly secreted by a variety of cells in response to viral or microbial infections 32chemokines act as powerful chemoattractants which recruit inflammatory cells to migrate from the intravascular space across the endothelium and epithelium into the inflammation site according to a chemokine gradient33 the role of one specific chemokine cxcl10 previously referred to as interferon- inducible protein of 10 kda or ip-10 has been highlighted in ards in both experimental models and in patientsindeed in a mouse model of il-2 induced ards an up-regulation of the mouse cxcl10 analogue mob-1 mrna was observed at initiation of lung injury 34 several studies also showed that the intratracheal injection of mob-1 in mice induced pulmonary migration of leukocytes in the alveolar space with massive recruitment of neutrophils especially monocytes this event was rapidly followed by microvascular injury and pulmonary edema typical of ards 3536 cxcl10 signaling appears to be a critical factor for the onset of ards as shown in mice models of ards induced by either acid aspiration or by viral infection with influenza h5n1 virus briefly ichikawa et al demonstrated that wild-type mice developing ards had increased levels of cxcl10 mainly due to an increased secretion by infiltrating neutrophils which induced an autocrine loop mechanism on the chemotaxis of inflamed neutrophils leading to fulminant pulmonary inflammation on the contrary cxcl10 andor its receptor cxcr3 knock-out mice showed decreased lung injury severity and increased survival in response to both viral and non-viral lung injury 37 moreover cxcl10 expression in the lung was significantly up-regulated after induction of ards with lipopolysaccharide lps in a mouse model of lung injury and the neutralization of cxcl10 with anti-cxcl10 antibody lead to amelioration of lung injury38cxcl8 also referred at as il-8 is another chemokine considered as a potential prognostic bio-marker for ards clinical course 39 indeed cxcl8 levels were found to be elevated both in plasma 40 41 42 43 and in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid 44 45 46 of patients with ards a direct role of cxcl8 in the progression of ards was proven in rabbit with acid-induced ards lead to a 10-fold increase in cxcl8 levels in the alveolar fluids of note pre-treatment with an anti-cxcl8 antibody prevented the development of the typical acute lung injury47although chemokines are crucially involved in the regulation and maintenance of immune responses their role in the onset of the coronavirus-induced cytokine storm is still poorly investigatedbefore addressing the specific relationship between chemokines and coronavirus infections it is mandatory to briefly overview the general role of chemokines in viral infections and how viruses contrast the actions of chemokinesviruses are infectious agents of small size and simple composition that can multiply only in living cells of animals plants or bacteria all viruses contain a nucleic acid either -dna deoxyribonucleic acid or -rna ribonucleic acid and several proteins viruses should not even be considered organisms since they are not free-living ie they require a host cell thus viruses need to elude the host immune defense to infect its cells in order to reproduce and survive 54the chemokinechemokine receptor-related immune defenses are the main obstacles to be by-passed by viruses some chemokines play a direct anti-viral effect by inducing an array of phenomena that lead cells to determine an anti-viral state these phenomena include activation of apoptosis or direct killing of infected cells by activated immune cells chemokines also recruit immune cells to the site of infection which will fight against the intruder 55 viral infections are associated with enhanced expression of several chemokines in particular the interferons-inducible ones interferons which can be produced by any mammalian cell are involved in the rapid and efficient host innate response against viruses a powerful ifn response triggered by the first contact with a virus can slow down viral multiplication and buy time for the organism to establish a more efficient adaptive immune response 56 ifns can stimulate surrounding cells to express potent antiviral proteins including enzymes transcription factors cell surface glycoproteins cytokines and chemokines 5758 moreover they can inhibit cell proliferation regulate apoptosis and modulate the immune response 59 among interferons-induced molecules the chemokine cxcl10 is currently regarded as a main player in the organism anti-viral response 60 and particularly in respiratory tract infections several studies demonstrated that cxcl10 levels as evaluated in serum bronchial-alveolar washing fluid or nasal secretions consistently correlate with the severity and duration of acute respiratory tract infection due to viral infections 60 61 62also the chemokine cxcl8 is involved in inflammation and immune cell trafficking in the context of viral infections cxcl8 plays a major role in the initial control of respiratory tract infection due to its chemotactic activity for neutrophils and monocytes 63 cxcl8 levels in the nasal washing fluid correlate with symptoms severity during acute respiratory tract infections 64 although in the majority of cases a strong chemokine action can efficiently contrast viral infections some viruses acquire the capacity of escaping this surveillance system furthermore viruses can use the chemokine system network for their own favor by several strategies-some viruses mimic the components of the chemokine system by producing molecules that are very similar to chemokines and can interact with their receptor these molecules generate an incongruous signal leading to a disorganized immune response to viruses 65-inhibition of the interferon-induced anti-viral response several viruses do impair the intracellular receptors devoted to pathogen recognition such as toll like receptors and intracellular rna sensors 66
taken together the above data indicate that viruses can interfere with the chemokinechemokine-receptors system using their own properties to modify intracellular signaling with the final result to further disseminate the infectionsince the first reports of sars it seemed clear that the severe clinical manifestations of the disease could not be ascribed only to the viral activity per se but that an immune-mediated mechanism rather than a direct virus-induced damage would drive the clinical progression 67 indeed from the physio-pathology point of view the most interesting observation was the demonstration that viral titers seemed to paradoxically diminish during the most severe phase of the disease both in humans and in several animal models 1 data coming from patients series described during the 2003-2004 epidemics clearly suggested that complex alterations in the chemokine system were related to the outcome of sars-cov infection fig 1

in vivo studies showed that several circulating chemokines cxcl8 ccl2 and cxcl10 and inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 and il-12 were elevated in patients with sars-cov 6869 cxcl10 was also considered an excellent prognostic marker for sars disease progression 7071 in particular jiang et al showed that cxcl 10 serum levels were significantly increased during the early stage of sars and remained elevated until resolution moreover persistently elevated cxcl10 serum levels during follow-up were predictive of a worse outcome of the infection 71these findings prompted further in vitro studies aimed at investigating the relationship between sars and the chemokine system spiegel et al demonstrated that in addition to its direct effect on epithelial lung cells sars-cov could also enter macrophages and dendritic cells 72 this appeared crucial as viral entrance in these cells lead to an abortive infection eg the virus enters the host-cell but cannot successfully complete replication yet the virus elicited the secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines by dendritic and macrophages cells 73 this finding was confirmed in vivo because the serum levels of a wide spectrum of cytokines and chemokines produced by dendritic cells and macrophages were elevated in sars-cov infected patients 74 furthermore the infection with sars-cov of human primary myeloid-derived dendritic cells was followed by an impaired defensive ifn response which was paralleled by a moderate up-regulation of pro inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-6 and a much more significant up-regulation of inflammatory chemokines such as cxcl10 ccl3 ccl5 and ccl2 75 the authors suggested that the lack of response to antiviral interferons in the presence of chemokine up-regulation could represent a further mechanism of immune evasion by sars-cov 73 in line with this hypothesis the direct exposure of lung epithelial cells 76 or peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs 75 coming from sars infected patients to viral proteins such as s-protein and n-protein induced a prompt release of several chemokines including cxcl8 and cxcl10 in vitro gene-expression studies also reported that pbmc from normal healthy donors inoculated with sars-cov showed an early enhancement in the expression of several chemokines belonging both to the cc family ccl4 ccl20 ccl22 ccl25 ccl27 and their receptors ccr4 ccr7 and of the cxcl family cxcl8 and il-17 77 additional data came from animal models of sars-cov infection in mice infected with sars-cov the clinical features of the syndrome showed an age-dependent increase in severity similarly to what observed in humans which was related to an increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines paralleled by a reduction in t-cell responses 78 another study showed that in mice infected with sars-cov robust virus replication accompanied by delayed type i interferon secretion caused a rapidly fatal pneumonia this delayed type i-interferon signaling promoted the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages with resulting increase in cytokine il-6 and chemokine ccl2 lung levels vascular leakage and impaired virus-specific t cell responses 79these data suggest that coronaviruses and in particular sars-cov have a peculiar ability to counteract the antiviral ifn response pointing toward the fact that the severity of disease might be due to immune dysregulation rather than to the level of viremia this dysregulation would be characterized by an insufficient type i interferon response too little and too late paralleled by an aberrant pro-inflammatory chemokine secretion by alveolar macrophages dendritic cells and pneumocytes 6680
in vitro data suggest that this class of viruses and in particular sars-cov uses several strategies to avoid type i ifn response both passive and active 5659-passive mechanisms include the induction of double membrane vesicles dmv at perinuclear sites within the cytoplasm where rna synthesis takes place this strategy may help to hide and protect rna replication intermediates from being sensed by intracellular rna-sensors thus avoiding the activation of the ifn cascade 8182-active mechanisms include a direct action of viral proteins on transcription factors and intracellular signaling molecules that regulate the ifn cascade in particular the sars-cov protein orf6 is able to inhibit the action of interferon regulatory transcription factor-3 irf-3 a transcription factor of the ifn genes 8384
the fact that sars-cov infection would upregulate the transcription of cxcl10 while significantly down-regulating ifns signaling could seem paradoxical however transcriptional enhancement of cxcl10 could be due to a direct effect on the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells nf-kb 85 triggered by sars-cov86 even if other authors did not confirm this early observation 87 similarly the up-regulation of the cxcl8 gene expression could be due to a direct effect of the virus at the cellular level indeed intestinal and lung cells lines infected by sars-cov promptly increase their secretion of cxcl8 88 this observation would fit with the notion that the expression of cxcl8 is dependent on the transcription factor activator protein 1 ap-1 which was shown to be strongly up-regulated by sars-cov 8689during the mers-cov epidemics several studies were aimed at understanding the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the severe and often fatal pneumonia were performed available data suggest that mers-cov infection shares some immunological aspects of sars-cov infection in terms of involvement of the chemokine system first an increase in the serum levels of cxcl10 when compared to controls was observed also in mers-cov patients more importantly a persistent cxcl10 increase was associated with disease severity 90in this regard the case of two paradigmatic patients diagnosed with mers-cov is worth noting one had a fatal outcome and experienced an impaired ifn response together with a relevant increase in serum cxcl10 levels the other one with a favorable outcome displayed an up-regulation of ifns and irf3 and a less pronounced increase of serum cxcl10 levels 91
in vitro studies also support the relevance of chemokines in mers-cov patients a 2013 study evaluated the expression of several chemokines and cytokines in cell lysates of polarized airway epithelial cells infected with mers-cov or sars-cov the results showed that cxcl8 was up-regulated to a greater extent by mers-cov infection as compared with sars-cov at difference ccl2 and cxcl10 were more strongly up-regulated by sars-cov than mers-cov 92 in addition in dendritic cells infected with mers-cov a significant down-regulation of ifn response paralleled by a striking elevation of cxcl10 was observed 93 a strong induction of cxcl10 secretion was observed also in monocyte-derived macrophages infected with mers-cov 9495 interesting data come also from an experimental mouse model of mers-cov infection in which a significant increase in cxcl8 expression was observed in lung and brain tissue after infection with mers-cov 96data regarding the relationship between covid-19 and chemokine dysregulation are still scanty but are increasingly being reported although preliminary the available data provided by both clinical and in vitro studies suggest possible similarities between what was observed after sars-cov and mers-cov infection overall an increased production of pro-inflammatory chemokines mainly cxcl10 and cxcl8 seems to characterize also covid-19 infectionthere are few in vitro studies regarding sars-cov-2 infection published so far the results of a study comparing sars-cov-2 and sars-cov viruses behavior in the lung tissue should be overviewed briefly the inoculation of the two viruses in ex vivo human lung tissue explants showed that sars-cov-2 was more capable as compared with sars-cov in both infecting and replicating in human lung furthermore sars-cov-2 infection was less able to trigger the expression of any ifns suggesting that sars-cov and sars-cov-2 might differ in their ability to modulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as an example it could be worth highlighting that sars-cov infection upregulated 11 out of the 13 pro-inflammatory factors evaluated while sars-cov-2 upregulated only five of them namely cxcl10 il6 ccl2 cxcl1 cxcl5 interestingly cxcl8 transcription was up-regulated only by sars-cov but not sars-cov-2 infection while the opposite was observed for cxcl10 97the potential involvement of the chemokine system during sars-cov-2 infection was already evident from the first covid-19 series described by chinese physicians in early january 2020 it was reported that several pro-inflammatory cytochines and chemokines including cxcl10 cxcl8 ccl2 tnf and ifn were higher in the plasma of covid-19 patients as compared to healthy controls more importantly among infected patients cxcl10 ccl2 and tnf circulating concentrations but not those of ifn were found to be significantly higher in patients requiring admission to intensive care units as compared to patients experiencing a less severe clinical course 4chen et al recently characterized the immunological features of covid-19 patients with different severity of the disease briefly the 11 patients with severe disease displayed significantly higher serum levels of il-6 il-10 and tnf- and lower absolute numbers of t lymphocytes cd4  t cells and cd8  t cells as compared with the 10 patients with moderate disease of note severe cases were characterized by a lower expression of ifn- by cd4  t cells as compared with moderate cases 98xiong et al performed a transcriptome sequencing analysis of several pro-inflammatory genes in both pmcs and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of patients with covid-19 compared with samples form healthy donors the authors reported that covid-19 patients showed up-regulation of genes encoding for several immune-regulatory molecules in particular cxcl10 in pbmcs whereas no up-regulation of cxcl10 gene was observed in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid moreover an up-regulation of several genes involved in apoptosis and p53 signaling pathways in pbmc was observed leading to the hypothesis that this process could be the underlying cause of lymphopenia commonly observed in covid-19 patients 99 another study by wang et al including 65 sars-cov-2-positive patients showed that the absolute numbers of cd4  t cells cd8  t cells and b cells progressively decreased in relation with increasing severity of illness 100 in this view the findings recently reported by yang et al appear of potential clinical relevance indeed several cytokinechemokine levels were measured and found to be elevated in patients with different clinical severity of the covid-19 among them cxcl10 ccl7 and il-1 receptor antagonist were the ones significantly related to disease severity and even more importantly cxcl10 levels were the only one to be positively and significantly correlated with the viral load yang et al 2020sars-cov-2 and its related syndrome covid-19 have been known to the scientific community since less than 5 months clearly much is yet to be understood and the challenge for the next future will be to increase our understanding the physiopathology of this novel infectious disease hopefully the advances in our comprehension of the mechanisms sustaining the clinical course and patients-related factors driving the final outcome will be helpful in developing effective preventive strategies andor therapeutical options based on current knowledge the cytokine storm appears as one of the most dangerous and potentially life-threatening event related to covid-19 sustaining its major clinical consequences the immune mediated events related to the response to sars-cov-2 infection and the role of the chemokinechemokine receptor system will be further and more extensively characterized with the final goal to identify targeted therapeutic strategies although lessons from the previous sars and mers epidemics can be drawn there is still much to do in order to conclude whether sars-cov-2 virus behaves in the same way of its predecessors or if it is characterized by peculiar specificities clearly the hide-and-seek challenge between the virus and our immune defenses will also help us understanding the extremely variable spectrum of clinical manifestations of covid-19 which appears to range between asymptomatic cases to possibly lethal bilateral pneumonia with

editing mario rotondi conceptualization writing- reviewing and editing supervisionthe ability to control viral load is one of the best prognostics of whether a patient will have mild or severe covid-19 symptoms 15 for the immune system to effectively suppress then eliminate sars-cov-2 it must perform four main tasks 1 recognize 2 alert 3 destroy and 4 clear each of these mechanisms are known to be dysfunctional and increasingly heterogeneous in older people 16 17 but which tasks are most relevant to covid-19 progression in older people is not yet clear 18during aging the immune system changes in two major ways one is a gradual decline in immune function called immunosenescence which hampers pathogen recognition alert signaling and clearance this is not to be confused with cellular senescence an aging-related phenomenon whereby old or dysfunctional cells arrest their cell cycle and can become epigenetically locked into a pro-inflammatory state in which they secrete cytokines and chemokines the other classic immune system change during aging is a chronic increase in systemic inflammation called inflammaging which arises from an overactive yet ineffective alert system 19an abundance of recent data describing the pathology and molecular changes in covid-19 patients points to both immunosenescence and inflammaging as major drivers of the high mortality rates in older patients within immunosenescence there are defects in both the innate and adaptive immune systems innate immunosenescence is characterized by ineffective pathogen recognition and macrophage activation and a reduction in natural killer nk cell cytotoxicity whereas adaptive immunosenescence is characterized by thymic atrophy and accumulation of anergic memory lymphocytes in both cases these age-related changes are thought to be due to pathogenic genetic and lifestyle factors that affect the cells epigenetic status and the diversity of immune cellsthe innate immune system is the bodys first line of defense against coronaviruses sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells recognize structurally conserved viral proteins via single-pass membrane-spanning receptors called toll-like receptors tlrs expressed on their cell surfaces defects in tlr function in innate immune cells are known to increase the severity of pneumonia in mice especially in the context of aging and chronic inflammaging 20 alveolar macrophages ams are mononuclear phagocytes that surveil the lungs for dust allergens and the remnants of pathogens when their tlrs detect an invader ams respond by producing type i interferons which attract immune cells to the site of infection and present antigens to lymphocytes 21 22 although ams increase in number during aging their plasticity to convert between pro- and anti-inflammatory states is greatly reduced 23 exemplified by a weak cytokine response after tlr activation 24 figure 1the inability of ams in older individuals to recognize viral particles and convert to a pro-inflammatory state likely accelerates covid-19 in its early stages whereas in its advanced stages ams are likely to be responsible for the excessive lung damage a recent study comparing immune cell composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from moderate and severe covid-19 patients showed in severe cases macrophages were phenotypically more proinflammatory expressing higher levels of ccr1 and cxcr2 that recruit other innate immune cells compared to macrophages from moderate covid-19 cases that expressed more t-cell attracting chemokines 25 prolonged monocyte activation is a well-known cause of severe lung injury in rhesus monkeys 26 and in cases of sars caused by sars-cov-1 higher numbers of pulmonary neutrophils and macrophages correlated with the development of ards and greater lung damage 27 a decline in neutrophil activity might also be partly responsible because during aging these cells progressively lose their ability to migrate to sites of infection and kill infected cells 28 29 nk cells a major component in innate immunity with potent cytotoxic activity are an unlikely cause of covid-19 severity their numbers are relatively stable during aging 30 and in a mouse model of sars they were not necessary for normal viral clearance 31 to discern which of these cell types play the most destructive roles more detailed analyses of covid-19 patient autopsy tissue will be neededadditionally the production and diversity of mucins protective glycoproteins found in mucosal barriers throughout the body also change in aging 32 33 although their role in immunity against coronaviruses in humans is understudiedimmunosenescence of the adaptive immune system is also a likely factor that determines whether a patient progresses to severe covid-19 figure 2 situated just above the heart the thymus  a primary lymphoid organ and the site of t cell development and maturation of early thymic progenitors from the bone marrow  is one of the first tissues to experience aging by age 65 the thymus is on average 40 its original size 34 coincident with activation of the inflammasome component nlrp3 and caspase-1 a pro-apoptotic protease 35 36 a build-up of intrathymic adipocytes further reduces thymic cellularity and deteriorates the thymic microenvironment thymic atrophy also contributes to a reduction of nave t cells and an accumulation of memory lymphocytes resulting in defective immunosurveillance and an exhaustion of b cells cytotoxic t cells and helper t cells 37 other common effects of aging on the adaptive immune system include a decline in the production of fresh nave t cells a less expansive t cell receptor tcr repertoire t cell metabolic dysfunction and weaker activation of t cells 38 39 clonal populations of cd8 t cells expand during aging limiting their diversity whereas cd4 t cells retain fairly diverse tcrs 40 and instead suffer activation deficits 39interestingly one study found that supercentenarians  defined as adults over 110 years old  tend to have an unusual population of cytotoxic cd4 t cells whose activation doesnt decline with age and can take on the effector functions usually performed by cd8 t cells 41 this t cell behavior may explain why some older people even some people over 100 are able to survive covid-19 measuring the repertoire and frequency of tcrs in patients from a spectrum of ages and disease severity should be performed to determine if a loss of t cell diversity is a reason why sars-cov-2 viral loads tend to spike in older people but not the youngnot only does the repertoire of t cells decline in aging so do their numbers those over 60 years old increasingly have low t cell numbers a condition known as lymphopenia 42 because t cells express very low levels of ace2 the lymphopenia in covid-19 patients is unlikely to be caused by direct sars-cov-2 infection 43 as in the case for hiv one proposed cause of the t cell paucity is an exhaustion of the immune system driven by repeated exposures to viruses over ones lifetime 42 44 45 this hypothesis is based on several studies that tracked the morbidity and mortality of people over 60 who had been chronically infected with human cytomegalovirus cmv 46 47 cycles of cmv reemergence were associated with vast immune system remodeling including a pronounced exhaustion of cd8 t cells that was more predictive of all-cause mortality than chronological age other studies indicate that t cell depletion is due to the cumulative exposure to many different pathogens and lifestyle factors not cmv alone 46 48 at the chromosomal level a major cause of immune exhaustion is telomere shortening in viral-specific memory cd8 t cells which induces cellular senescence a state of cell cycle arrest and hyper-inflammation that prevents expansion upon re-infection 49 the fact that in the most severe covid-19 cases bronchoalveolar cd8 t cells appear to have reduced expansion capability 25 and peripheral blood t cells express high levels of the immune-exhaustion marker pd-1 42 make this theory plausibleb cells  adaptive immune cells which produce antibodies in response to coronavirus antigens 21  are also less diverse and less responsive in aging 50 51 while total b cells numbers do not decrease in aging memory b cells accumulate and nave b cells are depleted which may lead to loss of diversity of the b cell repertoire although this has not yet been definitively demonstrated in humans 51 changes in igg glycosylation patterns however have been shown to strongly associate with age and inflammation and predict age-associated disease development 52 in particular igg n-glycans appear to be the most predictive of biological aging however b-cell intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of glycosylation in aging require further studydue to a lack of sun exposure and decreased production of vitamin d about half of all older people have a deficiency in this vitamin 53 which reduces the efficacy of both adaptive and innate immune responses and increases the risk of infection 54 vitamin d levels in older people are correlated with preserved features of immunity such as the cd4cd8 ratio and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after stimulus 54 55 although not all studies see a benefit of vitamin d supplementation on the risk or duration of lower respiratory infections 56 the majority have especially in those with an antibody deficiency or increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections 57 58 a recent meta-analysis of 25 randomized placebo-controlled trials concluded that vitamin d supplementation prevented about 20 of acute respiratory infections 59 as such some health professionals have recommended vitamin d supplementation for older people in general and especially for aged-care residents and critically ill patients as a strategy for improving chances of covid-19 survivalduring the course of covid-19 older patients can reduce their viral titers only to rapidly descend into a state of shock involving hyperactivation of the immune system and hypercoagulation in small blood vessels 42 60 this rapid and uncontrolled inflammatory signaling cascade typically occurs in the later stages of infection known as a cytokine storm it exacerbates the dyspnea and hypoxemia and triggers inflammation in major tissues such as the lungs kidneys heart liver and brain cytokine storm syndrome is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a maladaptive host response to an infectious trigger 61 the resulting vascular inflammation is emerging as the cause of complement-associated microvascular injury and thrombosis in severe covid-19 cases 62 the initial trigger for cytokine storm is not yet known but it likely involves the immune systems detection of a large quantity of viral antigens released by dying cells why older people are particularly prone to cytokine storms is also unclearthe cytokine profiles of late-stage covid-19 patients are similar to patients with secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis a type of cytokine storm that can be triggered by systemic viral infection including increased levels of interleukin il-2 il-6 il-7 c-reactive protein crp granulocyte-colony stimulating factor gcsf interferon- inducible protein 10 ip-10 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1- mip1- and tumor necrosis factor- tnf- 45 63 64even more predictive of death than serum cytokine profiles is an increase in the fibrin degradation product d-dimer released from blood clots in the microvasculature and a prognostic for dic 9 as such d-dimer is now widely regarded as a key indicator of the severity of late-stage covid-19 d-dimer levels naturally increase with age most likely reflecting a higher basal level of vascular inflammation 65 which could predispose patients to severe covid-19 it would therefore be informative to know if pre-cytokine storm levels of d-dimer levels could predict who is likely to develop a cytokine stormin cytokine storms high levels of il-6 cause vascular endothelial cells to secrete fibrin which causes dic in the lung this may underlie the hypoxemia seen in patients with seemingly functional lungs if left untreated clots leach additional clotting factors from the bloodstream increasing the risk of bleeding coagulopathy and multi-organ failure drugs such as tocilizumab actemra which block il-6 receptor activity are currently being used in patients in advanced stages 66one in two fatal cases of covid-19 experience a cytokine storm 82 of whom are over the age of 60 67 though there may be many simultaneous triggers of the storm abundant evidence indicates that inflammaging is a major driver exacerbated by obesity poor diets and oral health microbial dysbiosis and sedentary lifestyles 68 69 for example in rodents inflammaging increases the risk of cytokine storm syndrome 70 and in humans age correlates with higher basal circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6 tnf- il-1 and crp 71 72a central player that could help explain the predisposition to cytokine storms is nlrp3 the major protein component of the inflammasome during aging there is a steady increase in the abundance and activity of nlrp3 in immune cells including ams of the lung which upon chronic stimulation contribute to pulmonary fibrosis 73 nlrp3 inflammasome activation requires two steps the first of which is the priming step induced by tlrs or tumor necrosis factor receptor activation this leads to the activation of nf-b and promotes the expression of nlrp3 pro-il-1 and pro-il-18 the second step also called the activation step is triggered by a range of stimuli that emerge during infections such as tissue damage nucleic acids and invading pathogen proteins 74in older individuals nlrp3 may be poised for hyperactivation by sars-cov-2 antigens nlrp3 activity is under the direct control of sirtuin 2 sirt2 a member of the nad-dependent sirtuin family of deacetylases sirt1-7 75 during aging nad levels decline reducing the activity of the sirtuins 76 old mice especially those deficient in sirt2 have decreased glucose tolerance and increased insulin resistance 77 this decline exacerbated by covid-19 might promote hyperactivation of nlrp3 and the trigger cytokine storms in covid-19 patients 14 maintaining nad levels may therefore alleviate covid-19 symptoms a possibility supported by recent data showing that sars-cov-2 proteins hyperactivate poly-adp-ribose polymerases parp9 -10 -12 and -14 and deplete cellular nad 78 additionally nad precursors lower inflammation in human subjects 79 80mechanisms of infection in other coronaviruses support the hypothesis that nlrp3 activation is a trigger of cytokine storms in the aged the sars-cov-1 orf3a protein for example is a potent activator of pro-il-1 gene transcription and protein maturation the two main signals required for activation of nlrp3 81 in macrophages sars-cov-1 orf8b robustly activates the nlrp3 inflammasome by interacting directly with the leucine rich repeat domain of nlrp3 in cytosolic dot-like structures 82 suggesting another two-step model in which inflammaging and the nlrp3 basal overactivation is the first step and sars-cov-2 antigen-mediated hyperactivation is the second step that triggers a cytokine stormin chronic diseases hyperactivity of the inflammasome plays a dominant role in the development of type 2 diabetes and other age-related diseases 83 indeed in older adults the upregulation of two inflammasome-related gene sets correlate with increased risk of hypertension metabolic dysfunction oxidative stress and mortality 84 individuals over the age of 85 that expressed lower levels of these inflammasome modules were less likely to die within seven years 84 taking together the known effects of coronavirus proteins on nad nlrp3 and the two stages of inflammasome activation these data provide a plausible explanation as to why co-morbidities positively correlate with cytokine storms and fatality in covid-19 patientsafter age and hematological cancers obesity is the next major risk factor for covid-19 fatality similar to type 2 diabetes 85 obesity is well known to increase the activity of nlrp3 and stimulate low grade inflammation in mice including higher levels of serum chemokines and lower neutralizing antibodies and effector memory t cells during a viral infection 86 accordingly this may help explain why obesity is associated with lower survival in covid-19 sars-cov-1 and mers-cov infections and why obesity-related human diseases such as cardiovascular disease chronic kidney disease and diabetes predispose patients to cytokine storms table 1 8789 in addition by causing the endothelium of the microvasculature to become leaky obesity and type 2 diabetes may increase the ability of sars-cov-2 to infect surrounding pericytes that appear to express ace2 at levels far greater than surrounding cells 12the dysregulation of the epigenome and resulting changes in gene expression during aging are strongly implicated as biomarkers and potentially underlying causes of chronic disease states and of aging itself the relocalization of chromatin modifiers theory of aging postulates that symptoms of aging and the loss of resilience are a result of a lifetime accumulation of epigenetic changes 90 91 these changes may be caused in part by the redistribution of chromatin factors such as the nuclear proteins sirt167 hdac1 and parp1 away from regular loci to sites of dsdna break repair then back again causing epigenetic noise to accumulate which may iteratively erase cellular identity 9094 this process is thought to manifest as dna methylation changes that set the pace of the biological clock in tissues and in hematopoietic cells 95 96there is an abundance of evidence indicating that age-related changes to the hosts epigenome compromise immune cell composition and function 97 and negatively impact viral defenses 98 99 including adaptive immune memory 100 101 coronaviruses are known to mediate epigenetic alterations potentially accelerating the rate that the immune system ages mers-cov for example antagonizes host antigen presentation by altering dna methylation a mark that silences genes encoding major histocompatibility complexes 102 similarly sars-cov-1 changes histone methylation and long non-coding rnas which is accompanied by the activation of interferon-response genes 103 measuring the dna methylation age of immune cells and other blood cell types before during and after infection could help elucidate both how the aged epigenome impacts disease severity and how the virus alters the aged epigenomethe vulnerability of the aged to sars-cov-2 may also have to do with the effects of the epigenome on viral entry which is initiated by physical interaction between the viral spike glycoprotein receptor and the ace2 cell surface protein 104 while genetic differences in ace2 are being pursued as a cause of covid-19 severity 105 there is little attention being paid to epigenetic differences in humans ace2 is ubiquitously expressed in epithelial tissues of the body most highly in alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine 106 ace2 is regulated in the body transcriptionally post-transcriptionally and post-translationally 107 although its role and regulation in covid-19 is still poorly understoodin both mice and rats ace2 expression decreases with age and is associated with an increase in aortic fibrosis and inflammation 108 109 in healthy human lungs ace2 expression does not appear to change with age 110 even though ace2 is more highly expressed in the lungs of cigarette smokers 111 a meta-analysis of covid-19 deaths however did not identify smoking as a significant risk factor 4 ace2 promoter hypomethylation in lymphocytes correlates with transcriptional activation in patients with lupus 112 implying that transcription of ace2 is controlled by methylation although this mechanism has not been systematically investigated it is known however that methylation at one of seven cpgs in the ace2 promoter decreases with age and these cpgs are bordered by long-range promoter-enhancer contacts that may change over time 113 bisulfite sequencing of the ace2 gene paired with transcriptomic and four-dimensional chromatin analyses will be necessary to understand if there is a causal relationship between promoter methylation ace2 expression and disease outcomethe elucidation of sars pathogenesis is complicated by the fact that ace2 is also part of the renin-angiotensin system ras that regulates immunity fibrosis blood pressure and metabolism ace2 counteracts vasoconstriction caused by angiotensin converting enzyme ace by cleaving its product angiotensin ii most likely due to its role in vasodilation and reducing inflammation ace2 partially protects against sepsis-induced- and sars-induced severe acute lung injury in mice 114 115 and asthma-induced airway inflammation in rats 116 changes in dna methylation during aging are known to affect the ras 14 117 118 analysis of ace2 gene expression in the lungs of covid-19 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease found a correlation between ace2 expression and covid-19 severity 111 thus age-related dysregulation of ace2 could explain why age is such a risk factor for covid-19 complications and why cardiovascular disease and hypertension predispose patients to develop a more aggressive form of covid-19the effects of ace inhibitors used commonly beyond middle age to control blood pressure are generally believed to be neutral in covid-19 119 120 due to their opposing roles in the ras ace2 expression appears to increase when ace is inhibited likely providing a yet unknown protective function 121 inhibiting ace2 expression or blocking ace2 accessibility could prevent viral entry but may lead to vasoconstriction and hypertension instead the most promising ace2-targeted therapeutic strategy is to infuse human recombinant soluble ace2 into the airway or bloodstream to bind the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein receptor preventing it from binding ace2 on host cell surfaces 122 and slowing cell infection ratesthe sirtuins are a family of nad-dependent lysine deacylases that control numerous aspects of stress resistance and pathogen defenses sirt1 is a nuclear histone deacetylase that suppresses viral replication and chronic inflammation 123 by binding to the promoter region of ace2 sirt1 upregulates transcription under conditions of cell stress 124 during aging and perhaps particularly during the course of covid-19 levels of nad decline this is likely due to increased nad consumption by the cd38 glycohydrolase 125 and increased transcription of the poly-adp-ribosyl transferases parp9 parp10 parp 12 and parp14 in mice and humans infected with sars-cov-2 78 coronaviruses also possess an adp-ribosylhydrolase that further depletes nad apparently to disrupt cell signaling dna repair gene regulation and apoptosis 14 126 127by negatively regulating activity of nlrp3 sirt1 and the related protein sirt2 seem to play key roles in suppressing acute lung inflammation during sepsis 75 mice lacking sirt1 for example display aggravated inflammasome activation with increased production of lung proinflammatory mediators including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 icam-1 and high-mobility group box 1 hmgb1 and a dramatic reduction of lung claudin-1 and vascular endothelial-cadherin expression 128 further as a result of nad depletion in mouse models of uncontrolled diabetes dna repair is blunted leading to pulmonary inflammation senescence and fibrosis 129 which could explain why diabetics are more susceptible to covid-19 sirt1 also attenuates the acute inflammatory response through deacetylation of h4k16 in the tnf- promoter 130 another nuclear sirtuin sirt6 attenuates nf-kb signaling by deacetylating h3k9 131 thus a decline in nad and the known mis-localization of sirt1 and sirt6 across the genome during aging 90 132 could be major contributors to the age-dependency of covid-19 symptoms as such nad precursors such as nmn and nr 133 have been suggested as possible treatments for covid-19 especially in older people 78 clinical studies are needed to determine if nad supplementation would benefit in the early stages of sars-cov-2 to reduce replication or if nad treatment during acute covid-19 can hasten recoveryover the past decade a variety of biological clocks have been developed to predict human health and longevity more accurately than chronological age including those based on dna methylation patterns 134136 inflammaging 137 gene expression patterns 138 frailty 139 140 serum proteins 141 and igg glycosylation 142144 given that these clocks provide a quantitative measure of the rate of aging of an individual and their overall resilience biological clocks may be useful for identifying at-risk populations and for predicting within those populations who will most likely progress to severe covid-19estimates based on twin studies place the contribution of non-genetic factors on predicted covid-19 phenotype at 50 145 and on total disease burden in old age at approximately 80 146 indeed lifestyle factors that affect the epigenome such as calorie intake may increase the susceptibility to covid-19 epigenetic age is greater than chronological age in various disease contexts and lower in long-lived humans providing strong evidence that epigenetic age reflects biological age 134 147 age-associated changes to the epigenome have profound effects on the immune system including t cell function cytokine production and macrophage pattern recognition dna methylation is believed to set the pace of the aging clock in several mammalian tissues including hematopoietic cells of the immune system 95 96 epigenetic clocks that measure dna methylation at specific cpg sites are the most widely used measure of biological age and disease susceptibility 134 147 restoration of the thymus using a drug cocktail of metformin growth hormone and dehydroepiandrosterone led to the reversal of features of immunosenescence specifically increasing nave t cells and a decreasing senescent pd-1 t cells along with the reversal of the epigenetic clock by about 15 years 96 epigenetic age may be a better biomarker than chronological age in predicting how variation in lifestyle factors and age-associated comorbidities increase susceptibility to covid-19 and may also help determine if covid-19 infection accelerates epigenetic age we hope to test both by measuring the dna methylation ages of peripheral blood samples from thousands of covid-19 patients and correlating methylation age measurements with clinical outcomeschanges in glycosylation during aging may also predispose older individuals to severe covid-19 148 glycosylation is the enzymatic process by which carbohydrates called glycans such as sialic acid mannose and fucose are covalently attached to proteins or lipids typically on the cell surface or in the bloodstream an individuals repertoire of glycans  a notable example being the type of n-glycans attached to immunoglobulins 149  changes with age and environmental factors such as smoking and poor diet 148 the type of glycans attached to iggs affects their pro- and anti-inflammatory properties 150 decreased galactosylation of iggs is associated with central adiposity 151 and inflammaging in the context of diabetes 152 biological clocks based on igg glycosylation are able to predict chronological age within 10 years and can be improved by inclusion of clinical parameters 144 thus changes to the glycome with age could serve both as an indicator of biological age and could potentially predict covid-19 severityaging also changes the glycome via non-enzymatic glycation by which reducing sugars circulating in extracellular compartments covalently bind to proteins and lipids to form advanced glycation end products ages ages are present in large quantities in the western diet and greater consumption of dietary ages increases serum tnf- 153 ages tend to accumulate under hyperglycemic conditions and contribute to the pathology of many age-related disease such as type 2 diabetes and obesity 154 ages may increase covid-19 severity in the aged by inhibiting the nlrp3 inflammasome during the early stages of viral infection 155 when the inflammatory program is activated by the sars-cov-1 3a protein 156 ages also play a role in activating pro-coagulation pathways 154 potentially contributing to the dic observed in covid-19 patientsglycosylation patterns specific to older people may also impact viral entry the sars-cov-2 spike protein is heavily glycosylated 157 modifications that are highly conserved between coronaviruses sars-cov-2 shares 20 out of 22 of glycosylated n-linkages with sars-cov-1 157 in the case of the human influenza virus variation in sialic acid structures on the surface of cells lining the upper and lower respiratory tracts dictates tropism and age-dependent binding efficiency of the virus 158 but how changes in the coronavirus spike protein during aging might affect viral transmission and pathogenesis is not yet known if we are to use glycation as a prognostic marker for covid-19 it will be necessary to map the glycome in hundreds of patient samples with varying degrees of covid-19 severity including asymptomatic individualsbetween individuals heterogeneity of the immune system increases during aging 18 and may explain differences in susceptibility to infectious diseases a biological clock based on the immune system called imm-age was recently developed that predicts all-cause mortality in older adults more accurately than even dna methylation clocks 137 imm-age overcomes the limitation of inter-human immune heterogeneity by tracking immune cell frequencies and gene expression changes longitudinally within individuals and then computationally predicting how an individuals homeostatic immune state changes over time though individuals exhibit variation in immune cell-type composition these changes fall into three stages that converge on a common attractor point that correlates with age and is indicative of overall physiological resilience 137 in this way imm-age measures the entropic relationship between age and immune system remodeling the rate of which can predict survival because imm-age is even able to capture and predict the effect of inflammaging on the cardiovascular system and because covid-19 fatality is so closely tied to cardiovascular disease and inflammaging this clock may prove to be the most accurate at identifying covid-19-susceptible individuals more studies are still needed to determine if and how viral infections alter these and other biological clocks and whether variation in biological age predicts covid-19 severityadvanced age is by far the greatest risk factor for covid-19 fatality independent of underlying co-morbidities 4 this striking fact has led many researchers to speculate whether molecules that target aging itself called geroprotectors could be used to combat infections in older people 5 159 primarily via its regulation of cellular metabolism the mammalian target of rapamycin mtor signaling pathway controls several immune functions such as antigen presentation immune activation differentiation and cytokine production 160 161 low dose mtor inhibitors exhibit a hormetic effect in older people seemingly improving immunity and reducing rates of infection 162 163 people over 65 years old who took mtor inhibitors for six weeks responded more robustly when challenged with an influenza vaccine and showed reduced levels of the t-cell exhaustion marker pd-1 162 in a similar clinical trial protection from infection and an increase in anti-viral gene expression was observed even a year after the 6-week course of mtor complex 1 mtorc1 inhibitors 163 though the result was not reproduced in a phase 3 trialmetformin a blood glucose lowering geroprotector that activates 5amp-activated protein kinase ampk and inhibits the mtor pathway has also been suggested as a possible drug to combat severe sars-cov-2 infection in older people in addition to its potential insulin-sensitizing antiviral effect 164 metformin confers a myriad of anti-aging benefits including improving mitochondrial metabolism decreasing inflammatory cytokines protecting against genomic instability and decreasing cellular senescence 165 which may bolster the aging bodys resistance to covid-19 results from the ongoing targeting aging with metformin tame clinical trials and others should reveal whether these anti-aging drugs are protective against sars-cov-2 infection 165 166why sars-cov-2 infections are more severe and fatal in the aged is not known but viable hypotheses are emerging that include changes to the immune cell repertoire the epigenome nad levels inflammasome activity biological clocks and covalent modifications of human and viral proteins figure 3 much remains to be elucidated still besides understanding the basis of the cytokine storms and coagulopathy it is not known why sars-cov-2 so easily damages such a broad array of tissues in older people but rarely in the young nor is it clear whether older people develop stronger or weaker functional immunity during seroconversion or how long their protection will last compared to younger people in the aged immune responses to vaccination are also often weak or defective 18 167 168 whereas autoimmunity increases 169 therefore in designing vaccines against sars-cov-2 it will be important to consider that older people may not respond as well to vaccines as young people studies that follow the long-term consequences of sars-cov-2 infection in older people will also be critical to understand the long-term health consequences of covid-19 pathology such as fibrosis and scaring of the lungs micro-ischemic events cardiopulmonary dysfunction and neuropsychological disability 170 these could significantly reduce viral resistance and lifespan in older and middle-aged people who recover from severe cases of covid-19 the most exciting and potentially impactful technologies to combat covid-19 and other viral pandemics are those that activate the bodys defenses against aging 5 166 eventually with advances in the field it may even be possible to reverse the age of cells and tissues 171174 so that high-risk older individuals can respond to viral infections as though they were youngcoronavirus 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov-2 has been declared a global pandemic since march 2020 this viral outbreak has raised serious concerns among the public and patients with health conditions in the medical community rheumatologists are particularly concerned because their patients represent a population of autoimmune rheumatic disorders who are mostly on immunosuppressive agents and are susceptible to infection while much has been learnt on covid-19 in general little is known of covid-19 severity and outcomes in patients with rheumatic diseases rd herein in conjunction with the literature review we report a case series of patients with rd who were infected with covid-19a retrospective chart review was conducted in 4 hospitalized patients at stony brook university hospital between early march 2020 and the end of april 2020 including 2 cases that we previously published in the rheumatologist these patients had underlying rd on disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs dmards prior to developing covid-19 in our patients a diagnosis of covid-19 was made based on clinical grounds and by polymerase chain reaction of samples from nasopharyngeal swabs in addition a literature search of pubmed scopus and web of science databases was conducted between december 2019 and may 2 2020 using the terms covid-19 and rheumatic disease or biologic the search process and result are depicted in prisma figure 1
 english language articles that reported single case or case series of covid-19 in rd were reviewed relevant information such as demographic clinical therapeutic data and outcomes of these patients were gathered from the literature other relevant literature regarding the virus sars immune response and cytokine storm were also searched between 1990 and may 2 2020 descriptive statistics was used

the clinical data and outcomes of published cases are summarized table 2
 through the literature search we identified 9 separate studies of covid-19 in rd including 4 single cases 1 2 3 4 and 5 case series 5 6 7 8 9 these studies involved 197 cases of various inflammatory rd most patients were on conventional andor biologic dmards the most frequently used dmards were tumor necrosis factor tnf inhibitors among the patients there were 2 cases of rd on rituximab 1 with gpa having severe covid-19 requiring mechanical ventilation the patient received hcq and lopinavirritonavir the other patient with ra had clinical improvement after receiving hcqazithromycinlopinavir-ritonavirtocilizumab and supplemental oxygen there were 2 tocilizumab users including 1 systemic sclerosis patient who was treated at home and 1 ra patient on mtx and hcq requiring supplemental oxygen who was discharged 6 days later of the 6 secukinumab users 5 were treated at home while 1 required hospitalization but was discharged 3 days later among the 17 sle cases there were 7 icu admissions and 2 deaths all patients were on hcq and 7 were on immunosuppressive agents the authors did not specify the medications used among those icu or severe patients 7 in the global rheumatology alliance registry of 110 cases there were 19 sle cases however their disease severity and dmard use was not specified in addition there were 39 hospitalized patients and 9 deaths 9 in the new york university langone health group study of 59 confirmed cases of covid-19 there were 45 outpatients and 14 inpatients of the hospitalized patients there were 1 icu patient who had hypertension bmi 30 mild psoriatic arthritis and was on mtx prior to infection and 1 death who had coronary artery disease bmi40 and severe psoriasis the remaining patients had mild viral disease course based on the total number of the literature cases plus our 4 cases we estimated the mortality was 59 12201 among covid-19 patients with rdduring the ongoing covid-19 pandemic both healthy individuals and patients with chronic conditions can be infected we present a cases series of patients with rd who developed covid-19 both our case study and the literature data indicate that patients with systemic autoimmune diseases particularly those on dmards are susceptible to covid-19 with an estimated mortality of 59interestingly we find that these patients in the current study had different clinical outcomes in terms of covid-19 severity and related complications for example both the lupus patient on hcq and ra patient on etanercept developed mild viral symptoms the gpa patient on rituximab developed pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygenation via nonrebreather the as patient on secukinumab required mechanical ventilation these two patients with severe disease had significantly higher serum levels of il-6 that has been shown to correlate with severe covid-19 and its related disease 10 to address the question of why these patients had different outcomes of the viral illness several factors need to be considered including underlying rd age gender comorbidities dmard use as well as the pathogenesis of covid-19 among othersour analysis of these 4 cases has indicated that different dmards may affect the covid-19 course and prognosis differently to explain the potential effects of various dmards we will first discuss the immunologic mechanisms of covid-19sars cov2 is an enveloped rna virus that consists of four primary structural proteins including a spike s glycoprotein small envelope e glycoprotein membrane mglycoprotein and nucleocapsid n protein along with several accessory proteins 11 the s glycoprotein binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 a receptor on cell membranes followed by fusion of the viral membrane and host cell 12 13 the cellular serine protease tmprss2 is also required to properly process the sars-cov-2 spike protein and facilitate host cell entry 14 the virus entry initially triggers the innate immune response where pattern recognition receptors prr such as toll-like receptors tlrs recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns pamp the pamp may be nucleic acids glycoproteins lipoproteins and other small molecules that are found in the structural components of viruses this in turn induces a release of proinflammatory cytokines which activate transcription factors and jak-stat pathways further releasing a number of proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 interferon ifn- ifn- tnf other cytokines and chemokines this hyperinflammation can lead to cytokine storm 15 the virus also activates the adaptive immune response where activated th1 cells can stimulate cytotoxic cd8 t cells to destroy virally infected cells meanwhile th1 cells activate and stimulate b cells to produce antigen-specific antibodies 16 17 despite this defense mechanism like the 2002 sars-cov these viruses have the ability to evade the immune system 18 19 thus making the development of effective drugs more challengingit is reported that a subgroup of covid-19 patients15 developed severe infection and life-threatening complications in which hyperinflammatory responses or cytokine storm are involved 20 cytokine storm is defined as a syndrome of excessive immune activation and proliferation of t lymphocytes and macrophages with hypersecretion of proinflammatory cytokines these mediators include interleukin il-1 il-6 ifn- and tnf 21 22 23 huang et al described a similar cytokine profile in their patients with covid-19 and cytokine storm 24 th17 cells and il-17 are also involved in the cytokine storm response 25 with what has been learned on the role of cytokine storm it will be important to use that information to guide and formulate a therapeutic strategy for severe covid-19 patients henderson et al recently suggested to monitor covid-19 patients as early as possible with such biometrics as cytopenia fibrinogen lactate dehydrogenase hepatic transaminases elevated ferritin cd25 and il-6 for cytokine storm they also summarized treatment regimens for cytokine storm in general and their potential utility in severe covid-19 26 among them are il-6 and il-1 inhibitors which have been successfully used in alleviating cytokine storm secondary to certain systemic inflammatory rds 27 28 29 30 tocilizumab an il-6 receptor antagonist has been studied in covid-19 patients with some success a study of severe to critical covid-19 patients in china has shown improved outcome in 15 out of 20 patients 31 preliminary data from a french study also has provided promising results 32 an italian prospective open single-arm multicenter study of 63 hospitalized adult patients with severe covid-19 has demonstrated improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters 33 according to the literature data in our study two rd patients on tocilizumab developed mild covid-19 infection supporting the positive role of il-6 antagonist there are still several ongoing clinical trials to investigate the potential role of interleukin antagonists particularly il-6 and il-1 in the treatment of severe covid-19 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 jak inhibitors which indirectly block il-6 are also being studied in treating this infection 41 42 43 44 for a full consideration of using anti-cytokine storm to treat this viral disease other agents to inhibit the inflammatory mediators may need to be explored therefore it is worthwhile to investigate whether other biologics may have influences in the clinical course of the covid-19 related respiratory and other complicationsin the present study our ra patient on etanercept developed mild covid-19 without complications similarly in the published studies 7 cases were on etanercept and developed mild symptoms although some patients were hospitalized etanercept is a tnf receptor ii antagonist which is known to be associated with a high rate of infections unexpectedly it did not lead to severe covid-19 in our patient and literature cases perhaps due to its inhibition of tnf a cytokine involved in the viral disease cytokine storm according to the literature data in our study tnf inhibitors including etanercept adalimumab and infliximab were more frequently used in rd patients and they seemed to have less severity of the viral illness tnf has been reported to be present in the blood and disease tissues of patients with covid-19 45 additionally it is possible that pretreatment with etanercept could have resulted in a blunted il-6 response indirectly in an in vitro study il-6 and tnf were up-regulated by the recombinant s protein of the 2002 sars-cov suggesting that tnf or il-6 antagonists may potentially reduce the cytokine storm in covid-19 and its related lung damage 46 these data together suggest that tnf antagonist may be considered as a treatment strategy for severe covid-19 in the futurein case 2 the as patient developed severe virus-related complications it is unclear whether secukinumab a monoclonal antibody to il-17a could play a negative role in the case this is contrasting to an autopsy study of covid-19 infected cases which suggested a pathogenic role of th17 and potential benefit of blocking th17 25 in addition 5 out of the 6 rd patients on secukinumab from the literature data in the current study developed mild covid-19 and 1 was hospitalized these data indicate that il-17a inhibitors influence the viral disease courseour patient with sle had minimal viral symptoms without worsening of his underlying ild in an in vitro study hcq has been shown to inhibit endosome-lysosome system acidification and to suppress proinflammatory cytokines 47 hcq is currently being studied in multiple clinical trials 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 however the therapeutic efficacy of hcq in covid-19 remains controversial while some studies showed benefit 47 other studies produced mixed results chowdhury et al surveyed recent literature on clinical trials involving hcq and chloroquine they found 57 completed clinical trials showed favorable outcomes whereas 27 trials showed no change compared to control 61 in a french case series of lupus which was included in our study hcq was found to have variable outcomes in the treatment of covid-19 and its complications 7 another observational study at the veterans affairs hospital showed no benefit of hcq in severe covid-19 62 although hcq has been used to treat covid-19 its efficacy will need to be confirmed by the results of the ongoing clinical trialsour gpa patient was treated with rituximab a monoclonal antibody to cd20 prior to being infected this drug may have reduced her humoral immune response leading to a more severe disease course in a prospective study of 200 subjects infected with human coronaviruses neutralizing antibody has been shown to play a protective role by limiting the infection at a later phase and to prevent reinfection in the future 63 sars-cov infection induces igg production against n protein which can be detected in serum as early as day 4 after the onset of disease and with most patients being seroconverted by day 14 64 65 hence b-cell depletion with rituximab may have altered the antibody response making the patient more vulnerable to the infection additionally sars-cov has also been shown to decrease t lymphocytes in 65 patients glucocorticoid administration contributed to further decrease in lymphocyte counts 66 as a result these together hinder the hosts ability to adequately respond to the infection similarly the published case of gpa on rituximab in the current study also developed severe covid-19 requiring mechanical ventilation 2 taken together these findings suggest that pretreatment with rituximab particularly with glucocorticoids could contribute to a more severe covid-19 infection and poor outcomein summary rd patients are susceptible to covid-19 various dmards may affect the viral process differently patients on etanercept hcq or tocilizumab may run a mild course of the viral illness rituximab or secukinumab could worsen the viral disease and its related complications our study may help in formulating a guideline in the future concerning immunosuppressive use in rd patients during covid-19 given the small sample size in the study as a limitation further study by expanding cases is warrantedno specific funding was received from any bodies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectors to carry out the work described in this articlethe authors declare no conflicts of interestnrf2 is a transcription factor encoded in humans by the nfe2l2 gene it has been called by many the master regulator of cellular redox homeostasis 1 as well as the guardian of healthspan and gatekeeper of species longevity 2 nrf2 regulates most of the genes that defends us against oxidative stress including superoxide dismutases catalase numerous peroxidases and glutathione metabolism as well as hundreds of genes involved in scores of important metabolic pathways 3 the individual vulnerabilities of various structural and catalytic gene products to damage or inactivation by reactive oxygen species ros may lead to degenerative diseases and metabolic dysfunctions importantly nrf2 declines with age 45 and contributes greatly to the frailty associated with aging 67 because nrf2 transcriptionally upregulates genes that combat oxidative stress its loss allows oxidative stress to go unmitigated and drive the aging phenotype oxidative stress is therefore a common theme among the key features associated with the aging process collectively referred to as the hallmarks of aging as it disrupts proteostasis alters genomic stability alters susceptibility to viral and microbial infections and leads to cell death it is this age-related frailty that often defines the most vulnerable population in situations such as the one we currently face with the coronavirus pandemica number of published studies have implicated nrf2 as a regulator of susceptibility to respiratory viral infections a recent review by lee 8 points out that virus-induced modulation of the host antioxidative response has turned out to be a crucial determinant for the progression of several viral diseases a virus needs to keep oxidative stress at a level optimal for viral reproduction which is higher than normal to support the viral metabolism but should not be so high as to kill off the host cell viruses have evolved mechanisms for manipulating the nrf2 pathway in both directions depending on the needs of the virus but importantly taking control away from the host cell among the types of virus studied are influenza virus respiratory syncytial virus rsv and human metapneumovirus hmpv 913 the phenomenon is also seen in non-respiratory viruses including dengue virus denv 14 rotavirus 15 herpes simplex virus 16 zika virus 17 and hiv 18 suggesting that regulation of oxidative stress may be a need common to most if not all viruses and that nrf2 activators may offer multiple ways to regain control of important pathways to increase resistance and slow viral replication we recently described a phytochemical composition pb125 that potently activates nrf2 by controlling multiple steps involved in the process especially via the akt1pi3kgsk3fyn pathway 19the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of nrf2 activation via pb125 on human liver-derived hepg2 cells as well as on primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells in culture regarding the expression of genes known to be important for antiviral activity in general as well as those genes with specific relevance to sars-cov-2 and covid-19plant extracts rosemary extract from rosmarinus

error of the mean sem significant differences were determined by one-way anova and post hoc tukey multiple comparisons testing or by students t test for unpaired data using prism software version 60 graphpad software san diego ca usa a p value  005 was considered statistically significantusing the elisa assay we determined that pretreatment of hpaec with pb125 decreased the lps-induced release of il-6 protein from the hpaec cells in this study we treated hpaec cells for 16 h with 5 ugml pb125 or vehicle as a negative control then stimulated the pretreated hpaec cells for 5 h with 20 ngml bacterial lipopolysaccharide lps or vehicle as a negative control lps stimulation of the vehicle-pretreated hpaec significantly increased the release of il-6 protein in to the culture media but this lps-induced il-6 release was significantly attenuated p005 by pretreatment of the hpaec cells with pb125 figure 1because sars-cov-2 entry into a human cell depends on ace2 for binding and on tmprss2 for proteolytic activation of the spike protein 25 we examined the effects of pb125 on the expression of these two genes because inhibition of the protease activity of tmprss2 has been shown to block viral entry 25 we also examined the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 pai-1 encoded by the serpine1 gene a normal plasma component and known potent inhibitor of tmprss2 26 ace2 mrna was down regulated 35-fold and tmprss2 was down-regulated 28-fold by pb125 in human liver-derived hepg2 cells as seen in figure 2 while these impediments may not completely block viral entry they may significantly impair it slowing the rate of viral progression furthermore pb125 strongly up regulated serpine1pai-1 by 178-fold pb125 down-regulates hdac5 in human liver cells by 28-fold also shown in figure 2 in humans hdac5 appears to be responsible for the deacetylation and attenuation of nrf2 activity 27 the cytokine lif an important antiviral cellular response to viral infection 2829 was up regulated 66-fold by pb125 because of recent evidence that plasmin can trigger substantial proinflammatory release of cytokines 30 we examined the effect of pb125 on plasminogen plg mrna expression finding it to be down regulated by 19-fold thus all six of these gene regulatory effects of pb125 would appear to counter viral attempts to enter the cell and to usurp control of oxidative stress responseto examine the effects of pb125 on genes that may contribute to the covid-19-induced cytokine storm we examined a model of lipopolysaccharide lps treated hpaec with and without treatment with pb125 the results are seen in figure 3 all 36 genes were significantly upregulated by lps and normalized to 100 indicated by the red bar no pb125 sixteen cytokines including two colony stimulating factors are shown in green with mrnas downregulated by pb125 as indicated the average percent inhibition for the group of cytokines was 70 two proinflammatory interleukins il-1b and il-6 showed mrnas inhibited 61 and 44 respectively three proinflammatory cytokine-induced adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule 1 icam1 vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 vcam1 and endothelial cell selectin sele were suppressed an average of 78 tumor necrosis factor tnf mrna was reduced by 33 but a group of five tnf-induced proteins tnfaips were repressed even more averaging 70 four other genes representing the tnf family were downregulated an average of 65 also a family of five interferon-inducible genes are shown to be downregulated an average of 63 this across-the-board reduction of genes that contribute to the cytokine storm is noteworthy as it is the intensity of this storm that predicts icu fatalities from covid-19 transforming this storm into a manageable shower is therefore a major therapeutic objective in the clinical management of covid-19 patientsthe last decade has seen more than 10000 publications on nrf2 and its involvement in redox homeostasis inflammation and immunity neurodegeneration aging and diseases associated with aging ischemia-reperfusion injury and many other areas but relatively little has been published regarding its roles in viral infectivity and resistance despite some rather tantalizing studies kesic et al showed that sirna knockdown of nrf2 expression in human nasal epithelial cells effectively decreased both nrf2 mrna and nrf2 protein expression in these cells which correlated with significantly increased entry of influenza abangkok179 h3n2 serotype and replication in the transduced human cells 9 importantly they also demonstrated that enhancing nrf2 activation via supplementation with sulforaphane sfn and epigallocatechin gallate egcg increased antiviral mediators in the absence of viral infection and also abrogated viral entry yegeta et al took a different approach and increased oxidative stress not just by manipulating nrf2 expression genetically but by alternatively exposing mice to an exogenous oxidative stresscigarette smoke 10 cigarette smoke-exposed nrf2-deficient mice showed higher rates of mortality than did wild-type mice after influenza virus infection with enhanced peribronchial inflammation lung permeability damage and mucus hypersecretion cho et al 31 have similarly studied respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection the single most important virus causing acute respiratory tract infections in children they found that nrf2 mice infected with rsv showed significantly increased bronchopulmonary inflammation epithelial injury and mucus cell metaplasia as well as nasal epithelial injury when compared to similarly infected nrf2 wt mice the nrf2 mice also showed significantly attenuated viral clearance and ifn- and greater weight loss importantly pretreatment with oral sulforaphane significantly limited lung rsv replication and virus-induced inflammation in nrf2 wt mice komaravelli et al 1113 have noted that rsv not only causes increased production of ros but actively lowers expression of antioxidant enzymes by increasing the rate of proteasomal degradation of nrf2 at 6 h post-infection nrf2-dependent gene transcription was increased indicating that the cell is in control and responding to the insult of viral infection and the increase in oxidative stress by 15 h post-infection however the concentration of nrf2 had dropped significantly to about half its pre-infection level reflecting a change-of-control to favor the virus to accomplish this rsv had increased nrf2 ubiquitination triggering its proteasomal degradation representing one example by which viruses subvert cellular antioxidant defenses taken together these studies demonstrate the ability of nrf2 to impede viral entry slow viral replication reduce inflammation weight loss and mortality but without providing much detailed insight as to which genes and pathways are involvedthe first challenge facing a virus and particularly a virus that is jumping from one host species to another is gaining entry to the cell there are some fairly common ports of entry such as ldlr and icam-1 that lead to endosomal entry and which are shared among various viral families 32 sars-cov-2 however seems to be largely if not totally restricted to a very specific mode of entry the unique mode of entry may be the greatest vulnerability for the virus opening the door to some potentially effective therapies substantial evidence suggests that a transmembrane protease encoded by the tmprss2 gene plays a critical role in the entry for sars and mers coronavirus for 2013 asian h7n9 influenza virus and for several h1n1 subtype influenza a virus infections 253336 suggesting that targeting tmprss2 could be a novel antiviral strategy to treat coronavirus 33 hoffmann and coworkers found that infection by sars-cov-2 the virus responsible for covid-19 may depend almost exclusively on the host cell factors ace2 and tmprss2 25 the spike s protein of coronaviruses facilitates viral entry into target cells entry depends on binding of the s protein to a cellular receptor ace2 which facilitates viral attachment to the surface of target cells in addition entry requires s protein priming by the cellular protease tmprss2 which entails s protein cleavage and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes figure 4 this priming can be blocked by clinically proven protease inhibitors of the tmprss2 camostat mesylate 2537 and nafamostat mesylate 38 nafamostat is remarkably potent with an ic50 in the nanomolar range for blocking cellular entry of mers-cov in vitro but has not been clinically tested as an antiviral in humans the drug appears not to be available at present in an oral formulation and because of its lack of specificity there is concern over possible side effects 38 it may prove suitable for treatment of severe covid-19 casestmprss2 can also be blocked by the human anti-protease plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 or pai-1 34 as shown in figure 4 iwata-yoshikawa et al 34 found that knockout of tmprss2 improved both pathology and immunopathology in the bronchi andor alveoli after infection of the mice by sars-cov and completely prevented loss of body weight this is especially noteworthy in sars-cov infection where tmprss2 is not the sole mechanism for entry as is the case with sars-cov-2 thus our data showing that pb125 down regulated ace2 by 35-fold down regulated tmprss2 by 28-fold and up regulated pai-1 the potent tmprss2 inhibitor by 178-fold figure 2 strongly suggest that pb125 treatment might diminish the ability of sars-cov-2 to bind to a host cell and to obtain spike protein activation as a result of less ace2 and tmprss2 on the cell surface and as a result of a 178-fold increase in plasma pai-1 which would inhibit the remaining tmprss2 dittmann et al 26 have found that influenza a virus iav infection provokes a host response that is both necessary and sufficient for viral inhibitionincreased production of pai-1 they found that for iav proteolytic cleavage of the viral coat protein hemagglutinin by host proteases such as plasmin was a requirement for maturation and infectivity of progeny particles addition of recombinant pai to the apical side of haec significantly reduced iav growth compared to carrier control with about 90 inhibition of infectivity at 48 h post infection in contrast addition of -pai-1 antibody dramatically enhanced iav growth thus many viruses rely on both host endo- and exo-proteases for various entry and maturation functions moreover they found that tmprss2 is among the trypsin-like proteases effectively inhibited by pai-1 26quite apart from direct involvement with viral entry mechanisms pb125 down-regulates hdac5 in human liver-derived hepg2 cells by 28-fold also shown in figure 2 acetylation of nrf2 increases binding of nrf2 to its cognate response element in a target gene promoter and increases nrf2-dependent transcription of target genes 39 in humans hdac5 appears to be the isozyme responsible for the deacetylation and attenuation of nrf2 activity 27 and is likely the gene up-regulated by rsv infection described above by komaravelli et al 13 thus pb125 by inhibiting the deacetylation and subsequent degradation of nrf2 maintains more active acetylated nrf2 in the nucleus for a longer time counteracting one of the mechanisms enumerated above by which viruses attempt to commandeer control of the cells redox status and indirectly amplifying all nrf2-dependent actionsthe upregulation of the cytokine lif an important antiviral cellular response to viral infection is shown to be strongly up-regulated by pb125 in figure 2 again countering potential attempts by a virus to down-regulate it lif gene expression was downregulated by h7n9 infection and knock-down of lif increased virus titers for three influenza a strains investigated indicating an important role of lif in virus defense 29 in vivo studies were performed with lif knock-out mice that were infected with rsv lif knock-out mice yielded higher virus titers compared to control mice and lif signaling was shown to be critical for the protection of the lung from injury during 28while we have discussed the role of pai-1 in preventing tmprss2 from activating the sars-cov-2 spike protein mention should also be made of what many would consider its real job the blocking of the conversion of plasminogen encoded by the plg gene to plasmin by both urokinase-type plasminogen activator upa and tissue plasminogen activator tpa fibrinolysis was the first recognized function for plasmin so one might expect that high expression of pai-1 would cause low plasmin levels which might be a risk factor for venous thrombosis genetic plasminogen deficiency however is not strongly associated with risk of thrombosis 40 in a study of 23 subjects with homozygous mutations in the plg gene and little or no detectable plasmin 96 had clinical inflammation of the conjunctivae ligneous conjunctivitis but 0 had experienced venous thrombosis 41 new roles however have been recognized for plasmin regarding cytokine release 304245 a cytokine storm syndrome is a form of systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by a variety of factors such as severe infections it occurs when large numbers of leukocytes are activated and release inflammatory cytokines which in turn activate yet more leukocytes sato et al found that pharmacological inhibition of plasmin significantly prevented mortality in a mouse model of acute graft-versus-host disease proposing that plasmin inhibition could offer a novel therapeutic strategy to control the deadly cytokine storm that results from graft-versus-host disease preventing tissue destruction 43 macrophage activation syndrome mas is a life-threatening disorder characterized by a cytokine storm and multiorgan dysfunction due to excessive immune activation in a mouse model of mas shimazu et al saw a similar prevention in lethality concluding that plasmin regulates the influx of inflammatory cells and the production of inflammatory cytokineschemokines 30 plasminogen has also been implicated in activation of astrocytes to produce an array of proinflammatory cytokines 45 in figure 2 we report that pb125 downregulates plasminogen mrna by 19-fold in liver cells thus in vivo we speculate that the combined downregulation of plasminogen and 178-fold increase of pai-1 which covalently reacts with and deactivates both tissue- and urokinase-type plasminogen activators may significantly attenuate the plasmin-induced cytokine storm phenomenonhyper-inflammation in covid-19 is associated with such an elevation of proinflammatory cytokines interleukins and tumor necrosis factor- tnf and a large number of tnf-induced proteins and granulocyte colony stimulating factor gcsf or csf3 among 41 hospitalized covid-19 patients in wuhan china all had elevated il1b ip10cxcl10 and mcp1ccl2 sixteen of the patients were subsequently admitted to the icu and had even higher plasma levels of gcsfcf3 ip10cxcl10 mcp1ccl2 mip1accl3 and tnf and the intensity of the cytokine storm was a strong prognosticator of mortality 46 all of these genes encoding these covid-19-related cytokines appear in figure 3 as they were significantly up regulated by lps-treated hpaec and significantly down regulated by pb125 treatmentwe speculate that the well-documented age-related loss of nrf2 expression 45 is a potential contributor to the occurrence of a cytokine storm a longitudinal study of 40 confirmed covid-19 patients 47 showed that the 13 severe cases compared to the 27 milder cases were older mean age 597 vs 432 had significantly elevated c-reactive protein mean 629 vs 76 mgl and showed consistently higher neutrophil counts and lower lymphocyte counts throughout the two week observation period these observations 4647 document a clear predilection for severity of covid-19 infection directly associated with age and intensity of inflammatory response and presumably inversely associated with nrf2 expression the production and self-amplifying nature of an acute inflammatory response demands a prompt subsequent survival response from the host tissue to break the self-sustaining attraction of neutrophils to inflamed tissues we propose that it is a robust oxidative stress-induced activation of nrf2 in young healthy individuals that follows the gathering storm and rescues host tissues from irretrievable self-inflicted damage in older individuals or in the presence of comorbidities that may involve chronic inflammation the nrf2-activation response may be insufficient to break the self-perpetuating cycle of events figure 5 illustrates this proposed sequence of events we propose that activating a larger fraction of the limited nrf2 available in the elderly or otherwise compromised patients might allow them like their younger counterparts to shut down cytokine production to stop the escalating cytokine storm and to begin the recovery and repair phase of the inflammatory episode this activation boost to suboptimal levels of nrf2 can be provided by several pharmacological agents and as well or better by a number of phytochemical activators as we show here with pb125it is worth noting that the longitudinal study of covid-19 patients 47 reported a remarkably higher concentration of serum ferritin in the severe cases averaging 8355 gl with a range of 6354 to 15388 versus the milder cases averaging 3678 gl with a range of 1747 to 5220 ferritin has long been recognized as a source of iron released under inflammatory conditions by the superoxide radical 4851 under the intense oxidative stress precipitated by a cytokine storm the release of iron would catalyze lipid peroxidation and greatly amplify host tissue injury covid-19 has already been added to the short list of known hyperferritinemic diseases all of which are characterized by high serum ferritin and life threatening hyper-inflammation sustained by a cytokines storm which eventually leads to multi-organ failure 52 ferroptosis is a newly described form of regulated cell death that is iron-dependent and causes cell death by mitochondrial dysfunction and toxic lipid peroxidation nrf2 has been implicated as a key deterministic component modulating the onset and outcomes of ferroptotic stress 53an obvious weakness of our study is that we did not directly study either sars-cov-2 or the cells that most likely provide the virus its point of entry lung epithelial cells however we studied three different phenomena that may be involved in vulnerability but these interactive phenomena are not all present in any single cell type the first objective to study the effects of pb125 on expression of ace2 and tmprss2 should be studied in the presumed point-of-entry cells and the objective is most specific for sars-cov-2 we plan to examine multiple lung cell types using single-cell rnaseq analysis there are both clinical and laboratory suggestions that the virus may invade many organs in the body including liver where we showed down regulation of both ace2 and tmprss2 a second objective was to examine whether pb125 could limit systemic plasmin activity by down regulation of plg andor upregulation of pai-1 both plasma proteins not produced by the cells entered by the virus in this case the liver is the source of plg so we did look at the appropriate cell type the source of pai-1 in plasma isnt known but may be liver or muscle for the third objective of whether pb125 could down regulate the cytokines identified as participating in the cytokine storm phenomenon we believe the focus on primary hpaec is appropriate although a more complete picture would include study of the inflammatory cell types themselves hpaec get a local alarm signal from the infected epithelial lung cells but it is the hpaec that actually generate the 36 cytokines we examined sounding the systemic alarm that brings the inflammatory cells to the infected organ for studying how an intervention can break the inflammatory cycle we believe vascular endothelial cells may be the most important playersa substantial literature documents the ability of increasing cellular nrf2 levels either by genetic manipulations or by treatment with nrf2 activators to inhibit viral entry and proliferation for a broad range of viruses in addition several specific mechanisms whereby viruses are able to wrest control of the nrf2 pathway away from the host cell by controlling synthesis post-translational modification and proteasomal degradation of nrf2 have been demonstrated and are being pursued as therapeutic opportunities importantly the point-of-entry host protein tmprss2 a membrane-bound serine protease appears to be an essential requirement for sars-cov-2 covid-19 virus tmprss2 appears amenable to inhibition by pai-1 encoded by the serpine1 gene which is upregulated by pb125 the tmprss2 gene itself appears to be down-regulated by pb125 which would serve to decrease its activity further the downregulation of hdac5 by pb125 would lead to an increase in acetylation of nrf2 and an increase in its activity the upregulation of lif by pb125 would be expected protect the lung from viral-induced pathology during infection as lif knock-down increased virus titers finally and perhaps most importantly pb125 substantially suppresses production of multiple major contributors to the cytokine storm syndrome now known to be the direct cause of death in most covid-19 fatalities it seems possible that the sum total of these multiple antiviral effects may attenuate symptoms and perhaps allow successful navigation through the cytokine storm even though the never-ending evolutionary war-of-wits continues and the viruses occasionally win a battle this scenario of the complex and multi-faceted antiviral mechanisms regulated by nrf2 serves to underscore the importance of this very central transcription factor in keeping us protected and functionalin late december 2019 a severe coronavirus outbreak emerged in china it was caused by a novel virus sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from coronoviridae family 1 2 the infection quickly spread over the world the world health organization who officially named this infection as covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 on february 11th 2020 and declared covid-19 a pandemic on march 11th 2020 there are 4088848 confirmed cases and 283153 deaths ascribed to covid-19 worldwide as of may 12th 2020 source who situation report 113 it has a mortality rate around 7 however this could be an overestimation since not everyone is being tested for covid-19 the main route of transmission is person-to-person via respiratory droplets 3 4 primary prevention strategies such as quarantine social distancing and hand hygiene are the main methods to prevent the infection since there has been no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment yetsars-cov-2 has considerable genetic resemblance around 80 with sars-cov virus which was the causative organism of the 2002 sars severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic 5 6 sars-cov-2 has spike proteins on its surface and using these proteins it binds to target human cells the receptor for sars-cov-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 mainly expressed on epithelial cells renal proximal tubular cells enterocytes and endothelial cells 5 7 after attachment to ace2 the virus is endocytosed into the cell and interacts with tall-like receptors tlrs inside the endosome this interaction promotes a type i interferon ifn response and increases the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines through nuclear factor b nf-b 8 9there are two main reactions of the immune system to this virus an initial innate immune response through type i ifns described above and a secondary adaptive immune response which may lead to cytokine storm the initial ifn response aims to contain and clear the virus effectively and an early peak seems crucial for this effective control 10 the resolution of ifn activity generated during an innate immune response is required for recovery 11 after the initial ifn response macrophages are activated through their ifn- receptors and produce chemoattractants and proinflammatory cytokines 12 another reaction to the virus is the presentation of spike protein antigens to t cells by antigen-presenting cells which results in the activation of b cells and the production of anti-spike immunoglobulins when these immunoglobulins bind to spike proteins of the viruses coated viruses could be internalized into macrophages through fc receptors 13 these macrophages release proinflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the cytokine storm in the adaptive phase 13 14 the cellulartissue damage in covid-19 probably occurs in two ways 1 direct damage by the virus through viral replication and 2 the harmful effects of the exaggerated immune response resulting in a cytokine storm which means the uncontrolled and excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines 15 mice and non-human primate studies showed that a disproportionate immune response rather than the virus titer was related to death in sars-cov infection 16 17 the infection is mild in most of the affected individuals while it could cause a severe clinical situation mainly characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and cytokine storm that can lead to mortality 18 cytokine storm is the result of uncontrolled immune activation which leads to hyperinflammation and multi-organ disease 19 although everyone is susceptible to being infected by this novel virus covid-19 affects a specific group of individuals with more severe disease the main risk groups are elderly patients smokers and individuals with chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension 2022as the pandemic ensues we observe that children are affected less and most experience a mild form of the disease in case of infection 4 23 in the cohort study including 72314 covid-19 patients wu et al reported that only 2 of the cases were below 19 years of age 24 we assume that the immunosuppressant patients constituted a primary risk group for covid-19 however the current data have not conferred immunosuppression as a specific risk factor for severe or fatal disease consistent with the epidemiologic data from the previous coronavirus epidemics namely sars and mers middle east respiratory syndrome 25the drugs that are currently being used and tested in covid-19 treatment are mostly the ones used by patients with rheumatic diseases thus the rheumatologists participate in the multidisciplinary management of covid-19 patients as well on the other hand immunosuppressants put patients with rheumatic diseases in a vulnerable group in this pandemic thus making effective and accurate decisions about management strategies regarding these patients is critical and these should be based on the currently available scientific evidence as much as possiblethis review aims to provide an overview of covid-19 pandemic from pediatric rheumatologists perspective the aspects of covid-19 resembling rheumatic diseases the possible reasons for why children are affected less severely the hypothetic role of other available vaccines in preventing covid-19 the unique position of patients with rheumatic diseases in this pandemic the covid-19 patients with rheumatic diseases in the literature and covid-19 treatment with the drugs used for rheumatic diseases are discussed also a systematic literature search was conducted to identify covid-19 patients with rheumatic diseasesthe scopus and medlinepubmed databases were searched from november 1st 2019 to may 11th 2020 by entering the following keywords coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 sars-cov-2 rheumatology and rheumatic disease according to the published guidance on narrative reviews 26 the complete list of the search terms used for determining articles including covid-19 patients with rheumatic diseases has been provided in the supplementary table 1 case reports original research articles editorials and review articles with a focus on covid-19 were analyzed the following parameters were noted from the studies including covid-19 patients with an underlying rheumatic disease age sex underlying rheumatic disease age at diagnosis of the rheumatic disease features associated with rheumatic disease other comorbidities the previous and current treatment of rheumatic disease covid-19-related symptoms the method for covid-19 diagnosis covid-19 treatment and outcome and features regarding cessation and re-initiation of immunosuppressive therapies the search was restricted to english articlesseventeen articles describing 231 covid-19 patients with rheumatic diseases were found during the literature search fig 1 2743 among these patients there was only one pediatric patient who was a 6-month-old infant with kawasaki disease and covid-19 31 the characteristics of the patients are presented in table 1 775 of the patients were female n  179 the most common underlying rheumatic diseases were systemic lupus erythematosus sle n  117 and rheumatoid arthritis ra n  45 nine out of 231 39 patients died of note konig et al did not report outcomes with regard to mortality in their covid-19 cohort including 80 sle patients 41in addition to these articles presented in the table four articles reported covid-19 patients with rheumatic diseases 4447 these articles were not included since there were no details about these reported patients garg et al presented age-stratified covid-19-associated hospitalization rates of us patients 44 and in their report there were three out of 180 patients who were mentioned to have rheumaticautoimmune disease one of these patients was in the age range of 1849 years while two were  65 years of age xu et al mentioned that there were gout patients in their covid-19 cohort including 187 patients 47 in their patient experience survey study sirotich et al reported that 465 patients with rheumatic diseases had a diagnosis of covid-19 based on symptoms or physician diagnosis with positive laboratory tests 46 however no further details were provided about these patients including their underlying rheumatic diseases in the cohort of 1317 sars-cov-2 positive patients gendelman et al reported that three were on chronic hydroxychloroquine hcq and seven were on chronic colchicine treatment 45 but they did not mention the underlying diseases in these patientscurrently the exact reason why children experience a milder disease remains unknown several factors could contribute to this situation however the specific effects of these factors with regard to covid-19 have not been studied yetchildren travel less than adults which may be protective 48smoking is not an issue in childhood and the respiratory tracts of children have been exposed to air pollution for a shorter time compared to adults 48common comorbidities of adulthood like type 2 diabetes mellitus or hypertension are not so frequent among children 9the upper respiratory tracts of children are usually colonized with a variety of microorganisms which may compete with sars-cov-2 4951in children the innate immune response is more robust while the adaptive immune system is less educated and immature compared to adults 9 52 this may result in a sufficient clearance of the virus and a lack of an exaggerated adaptive responseace2 expression patterns in children could be different than adults 53last some childhood vaccines may provide a protective effect against covid-19 discussed in detail belowall of these factors could have a combined overall effect however we should keep in mind that children are not immune to covid-19 and although rarely the disease could be severe and complicated in children as well 54 and although the pandemic itself seems to affect children less severely it endangers the mass vaccination programs of who against polio and measles 55 this could result in epidemics of preventable infectious diseases especially among childrenanother point that deserves mention here is neonates of covid-19-positive mothers although anecdotal reports exist there is no direct evidence about the vertical transmission of sars-cov-2 from mother to child 56 chen et al detected no virus in amniotic fluid umbilical cord blood and breast milk samples from mothers with covid-19 and pharynx swabs of neonates born to mothers with covid-19 57analyzing differences between different risk groups may provide critical clues about the disease pathogenesis and we may develop new strategies to fight against this novel foebacillus calmette-guerin bcg is a live attenuated vaccine it is derived from an isolate of mycobacterium bovis and used as a vaccine for tuberculosis 58 the epidemiologic analyzes showed that the incidence of covid-19 and the death rate were significantly lower in countries with bcg vaccination programs compared to those without such a program 59 it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions as of yet however previous studies including randomized controlled trials have suggested a nonspecific protection against infections induced by the bcg vaccine 60 since mycobacterium is a bacterium while sars-cov-2 is a virus it is unlikely that a protective effect comes from cross-protection based on similar molecular structures previous studies have shown two possible mechanisms that explain the nonspecific protection provided by the bcg vaccine 61 heterologous immunity and trained immunity heterologous immunity means that cd4 and cd8 memory cells produced by the bcg vaccine in this situation could be activated in an antigen-independent manner 6265 this activation could be caused by cytokine stimulation by a secondary infection it is known that the bcg vaccine induces histone modifications and epigenetic changes in human monocytes at the promoter sites of genes encoding for proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 il-6 and tnf- tumor necrosis factor 66 this causes a more active innate immune response after re-stimulation trained immunity 58 61 66 which may contribute to the effective clearance of the virus in case of covid-19 arts et al have recently shown that bcg vaccination reduced the level of viremia after yellow fever vaccination and this effect was correlated with the induction of cytokine response 61 another possible pathway may be through the activation of the ifn-gamma pathway two studies nct04328441 nct04327206 are underway to test the nonspecific protective effect of bcg vaccine in covid-19indirect epidemiologic analyses also suggest a protective role for the mmr vaccine against covid-19 67 bianchi et al demonstrated that a considerable proportion of individuals did not show a protective immunoglobulin g igg titer against measles in the 10 years after vaccination 68 shanker et al hypothesized that age-related decline in immunogenicity of the measles vaccine could be an explanation for covid-19 being mainly an adult disease if the measles vaccine provides cross-resistance to covid-19 69 franklin et al demonstrated that igg titers against rubella increased in sars-cov-2 infection in some cases which might suggest a structural homology between rubella and sars-cov-2 67 they reported that there was 29 amino acid sequence homology existing between macro-domains of sars-cov-2 and rubella virus and 20 homology between fusion protein of measles virus and spike protein of sars-cov-2 this report is the only evidence supporting these data however this is a not-peer reviewed article and it remains unknown whether this resemblance is enough to cause a cross-reactive immune defenseit will take time for researchers to develop an effective vaccine against covid-19 thus it is wise to analyze the cross-resistance from other vaccines that are already being used however these studies should be designed carefully to control confounding factors considering all available data it is too early to conclude on a protective effect from any vaccine at the moment another point is that it is not possible to predict how fast the immune system will develop a response that will protect against covid-19 if this exists after another vaccine such as bcg or mmr vaccines at the moment childhood vaccinations should be applied according to the routine vaccination schedules of each country the recommendations about new vaccination plans could arise with accumulating evidence on cross-protectiveness of other vaccines for covid-19the main characteristics of covid-19 such as leukopenia thrombocytopenia myocarditis and interstitial pneumonia could also be observed in rheumatic diseases such as sle and systemic sclerosis 18 70 71 however the clinically significant features are mainly from the inflammatory characteristics that mimic our diseases in both clinical features and pathogenesis having common pathways in the pathogenesis highlights some of the drugs that rheumatologists use as candidates for covid-19 treatmentpediatric rheumatologists are very familiar with this entity since a significant portion of some common rheumatic diseases such as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis jia sle and kawasaki disease present this complication 72 this secondary hemophagocytosis is called macrophage activation syndrome mas in pediatric rheumatology practice thus the experience of rheumatologists was important when we realized that the severe end of the covid-19 clinical spectrum was a multisystem hyperinflammatory syndrome progressing to a cytokine storm with shock this situation resembles secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh or mas having said that we should be aware that covid-19-associated cytokine storm is not identical to mas it shares certain common features such as high ferritin c-reactive protein crp lactate dehydrogenase ldh low platelet and lymphocyte counts 73 but they also differ in some aspects for instance a decrease in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr is commonly observed in mas 74 however this does not seem to be a mandatory feature of covid-19-associated cytokine storm 73 75moreover zhang et al reported that patients with severe covid-19 had persistently very high esr 15 other interesting data come from autopsy findings of sars-cov-infected patients demonstrating that secondary lymphoid tissues were destroyed 76 this may explain the absence of splenomegaly as a significant feature of covid-19-associated cytokine storm although it is included as a criterion for diagnosing hlh 77 there are scarce autopsy data regarding covid-19 in one report of autopsy findings in two patients barton et al reported that there was splenomegaly in one patient while they detected remote splenectomy in the other 78 menter et al shared the autopsy findings of 21 covid-19 patients and they mentioned that they did not observe extensive depletion of lymphoid cells 79 increasing reports about the laboratory values and histopathological features of critically ill covid-19 patients will provide more clues about the similarities and differences between covid-19-associated cytokine storm and secondary hlhmas however we believe that the experience of pediatric rheumatologists contributed to the management of these severe covid-19 patients anti-il-1 and anti-il-6 strategies have been employed in the cytokine storm of covid-19 patients in most intensive care units 19another similar feature to rheumatic diseases is immune complex vasculitis which could be observed secondary to occlusion of blood vessels with immune complexes including spike proteins and anti-spike immunoglobulins 9 15 this may represent yet another form of immune complex vasculitis such as the hepatitis b-related polyarteritis nodosa pan with immune complexes containing the hbsagskin lesions are increasingly reported features of covid-19 and some of these are very similar to the findings of rheumatic diseases bouaziz et al reported violaceous macules livedoid rash purpura necrotic and non-necrotic which are similar to skin manifestations of systemic vasculitis such as severe iga vasculitis henoch-schnlein purpura and pan 80 they also mentioned chill blain-like lesions in their patients similar to the ones observed in interferonopathies like aicardi-goutieres syndrome and savi sting-associated vasculitis with onset in infancy 81 interestingly chill-blain-like lesions were also found in children and adolescents who were otherwise asymptomatic with regard to covid-19 82 this may well be because of the high ifn levels induced by the virus on the other hand one wonders whether background levels of high ifn would protect against covid-19 in the children with autoinflammatory interferonopathies such as savi or aicardi goutires syndrome acro-ischemia was reported in covid-19 patients as well 83 84 this feature is also observed in severe vasculopathies such as deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 85 86 these vascular lesions could be due to immune complex vasculitis or disseminated intravascular coagulation positive antiphospholipid antibodies may also contribute to the pathogenesis as recently reported 87 we need more histopathologic data to understand the exact pathogenesis of these featuresanother surprising feature of covid-19 was the development of a kawasaki-like disease in children very recently riphagen et al have reported hyperinflammatory shock in eight children with similar features to atypical kawasaki disease kawasaki disease shock syndrome or toxic shock syndrome 88 seven of these patients required mechanical ventilation for cardiovascular stabilization although no significant respiratory involvement was observed the initial tests for covid-19 were negative in all one of these children died after 6 days and sars-cov-2 was detected postmortem another child was tested positive for sars-cov-2 after discharge and the authors mentioned that positive antibodies were detected afterward in seven children the coronary arteries were severely dilated in one c-reactive protein procalcitonin ferritin triglycerides and d-dimers were elevated in all of note the ferritin level was highest in the child who died 4220 gl while the range was 2771023 gl in the rest of the series the laboratory features observed in this clinical situation are very similar to those seen in kawasaki disease shock syndrome li et al previously demonstrated higher levels of crp procalcitonin triglycerides and d-dimers in patients with kawasaki disease shock syndrome compared to patients with only kawasaki disease 89finally covid-19 has been reported to present with large vessel stroke in young patients 90there are still no data about the infection rate and course of covid-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases as mentioned above although the rheumatology practice mainly focuses on the immunosuppression caused by the disease itself or treatment of the disease a variety of immune dysregulation besides immune suppression exists in different rheumatic diseasesone group is autoinflammatory recurrent fever syndromes such as familial mediterranean fever fmf or cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome caps as we know pyrin and nlrp3 inflammasomes are overactivated in fmf and caps respectively 91 92 mefv mutations associated with fmf were thought to provide an advantage against some infections such as tuberculosis or plague in the mediterranean basin in the past 93 the findings of the nih national institute of health group suggested the idea that individuals carrying an mefv mutation might have a selective advantage against the plague 94 what will be the effect in covid-19 will these patients eliminate sars-cov-2 more efficiently or will the overactive inflammasome contribute further to the exaggerated immune response that complicate the disease we do not know the answers at the momentcaps also raises interesting questions activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome by sars-cov was observed previously 95 96 another microorganism that activates nlrp3 is streptococcus pneumonia 97 previously walker et al observed that pneumococcal vaccines could trigger a severe local and systemic inflammatory reaction in caps patients 98 they hypothesized that further trigger by pneumococcal polysaccharides to an already over-activated nlrp3 inflammasome might have caused these reactions this raised concern about the use of these vaccines in caps patients could the same concern be valid in case of covid-19 since caps is a rare disease the current data do not let us answer this question either another confounding factor is that fmf and caps patients are mainly on colchicine and anti-il-1 therapies which are currently being tested in covid-19 treatment to date there is only one report of covid-19 in a patient with caps who was on anti-il-1 treatment who experienced a mild disease course and recovered in a couple of days without any treatment 42previous data suggest that mutations in the main causative genes of primary hlh such as gene encoding for perforin were also associated with secondary hlhmas 99 there are also other mutations in other genes such as nlrc4 associated with rare monogenic autoinflammatory diseases causing a tendency to recurrent mas nlrc4-related disease is characterized by early-onset recurrent fever enterocolitis and repeated episodes of mas 100 patients carrying variants of these genes may also be more prone to cytokine storm associated with covid-19 future data about the course of covid-19 in the setting of rare monogenic autoinflammatory diseases will provide further insights about the disease pathogenesissle is the prototype of the autoimmune diseases and the main risk factor seems like the immunosuppressive therapies we use in sle treatment however sawalha et al reported that epigenetic dysregulation in sle resulted in ace2 overexpression and this might cause a specific tendency to covid-19 in this patient group 101 another debate in the literature focused on the hypothetical prophylactic effect of hcq which is used by a majority of sle patients discussed belowanother issue is that most of the debate is on the patients we are already treating with an established diagnosis of a rheumatic disease in a considerable amount of these patients there is some degree of disease control which means a balance between immune dysregulation autoimmunityautoinflammation and immunosuppressionimmune modulation the therapies the patients with rheumatic diseases who are not diagnosedtreated yet could form another specific vulnerable group for covid-19last immunosuppression is a known risk factor for infections although it did not emerge as a risk factor during the previous coronavirus epidemics sars and mers and the situation remains unknown in the current covid-19 pandemic 102 we still do not have enough evidence it would be safe to consider these patients risky while taking precautions but not discontinuing immunosuppressive therapies since these are important for disease control moreover active disease is a significant risk factor for an increased rate of infections 103 104data gathering through international rheumatology covid-19 registries will provide answers to some questions in our minds but it is essential not to make any early conclusions about resistance or tendency to covid-19 regarding a specific rheumatic disease or treatment before solid scientific evidence is obtainedthe hallmarks of covid-19 treatment are currently antiviral drugs drugs interfering with viral entry and immunosuppressive drugs mainly the ones targeting cytokines here we will primarily focus on drugs that are used in rheumatology practice since an early strong immune response is required for the effective clearance of the virus while the following exaggerated adaptive immune response should be tuned the timing and the duration of immunosuppressive therapies are very criticalnsaids nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used in rheumatology practice actually they may be of benefit to the musculoskeletal symptoms of covid-19 110 in pediatric rheumatology practice nsaids are the primary therapeutic options especially in the treatment of oligoarticular jia ibuprofen has been reported to increase ace2 expression 111 and anecdotal reports exist on a severe disease course in patients using nsaids 112 however there is no current evidence for a specific causal association between nsaid use and a more severe disease course in covid-19 110 113 previous studies have also suggested an association between nsaid use and higher rates of complications after respiratory tract infections 114 115 currently it is not possible to draw solid evidence-based conclusion on nsaid use over allglucocorticoids repress the transcription of proinflammatory genes 116 they may be used in the management of sepsis and septic shock at small doses and short term 117 some studies show beneficial effects of glucocorticoids in the treatment of coronavirus sars and mers pneumonia 118120 on the other hand some studies reported more adverse effects with the use of corticosteroids in coronavirus infection 121 and most recently tsai et al have demonstrated that an early corticosteroid treatment was associated with significantly increased hospital mortality in adult patients with influenza-associated ards 122 regarding covid-19 wu et al demonstrated that methylprednisolone treatment appeared to decrease the risk of death among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome 123 in their retrospective cohort study including 46 covid-19 patients wang et al observed that early low-dose and short-term application of methylprednisolone was associated with better clinical outcomes while they did not show any significant difference with regard to mortality rate 124 however it is not possible to conclude on a positive effect since the data are scarce at the moment who recommends against routine glucocorticoid use in covid-19 treatment randomized controlled trials planned to analyze the effectivenesssafety of glucocorticoid therapy in covid-19 patients chictr2000029386 nct042273321 nct042244591 will provide better evidence and may enlighten the role of glucocorticoids in covid-19hydroxychloroquine hcq an antimalarial agent is the mainstay of treatment especially in sle 125 being a weak base hcq accumulates in acidic environments such as lysosomes and endosomes and by increasing the ph in endosomes hcq interferes with tlrvirus interaction 126 it also interferes with glycosylation of ace2 and maturation process of viral proteins 15 126 as a result it may prevent viral entry and subsequent stimulation of proinflammatory pathways considering these mechanisms it appeared as a candidate for both prophylaxis and treatment in covid-19 to assess its prophylactic use shah et al systematically reviewed the literature and determined five studies three in-vitro studies and two clinical opinions 127 unfortunately it is not possible to conclude on a prophylactic effect of hcq based on these data in the same lines gendelman et al did not observe a protective effect of chronic hcq use in their retrospective study including 1317 covid-19 patients 45 thus there is no enough evidence supporting prophylactic use of hcq and further studies with a randomized controlled design are requiredin an open-label non-randomized clinical trial in a small patient group 20 patients and 16 controls gautret et al showed that hcq treatment was significantly associated with viral load reduction with more efficient results when azithromycin was added 128 studies are underway to obtain a better level of evidence eg nct04307693 nct04323631currently hcq is used in the treatment of covid-19 in most countries and for prophylaxis in some however considering the lack of evidence supporting its prophylactic use and the risk of short supplies for patients who need this drug prophylactic treatment should not be recommended at this stage monti et al reported that 51 out of 80 64 covid-19 patients with sle were taking hcqchloroquine cq before infection with sars-cov-2 34 moreover the frequency of hospitalization did not differ with regard to hcqcq use 34hcq is also associated with certain side-effects retinal toxicity is not a significant concern since it is mainly associated with its long-term use 129 however hcq use has previously been associated with qt interval prolongation 130 besides azithromycin which has been used in combination with hcq in covid-19 treatment is also a drug that can cause qt prolongation 131 thus these drugs should be used with caution in the treatment of covid-19 of note saleh et al reported that they did not observe torsade de pointes or arrhythmogenic death in their large cohort of covid-19 patients treated with cq n  10 or hcq n  191 132 but they mentioned that qtc interval was significantly longer in the combination group cqhcq  azithromycin compared to the monotherapy group cqhcq onlyjak janus kinase inhibitors are not used in pediatric rheumatology patients as extensively as they are used in adult rheumatology but these drugs are currently used in the treatment of jia and autoinflammatory interferonopathies 133 134 jak inhibitors have been suggested to interfere with viral entry by inhibiting aak1 which is a key regulator of sars-cov-2 endocytosis detailed above 5 they may also be beneficial by inhibiting the proinflammatory effects of ifns in the exaggerated immune response phase baricitinib is a selective jak1 and jak2 inhibitor 135 and it may exert an antiviral effect at the doses used for treatment in ra 136 emerging as a potential treatment option in covid-19 jak inhibitors may be beneficial at the severe end of the spectrum where ifn response contributes to the cytokine storm cameron et al demonstrated a prominent ifn- and ifn- signaling in deceased sars patients compared to a low ifn- signaling in patients discharged from hospital 11 however the window of opportunity at the early phase is very narrow and difficult to determine since the patient will be asymptomatic at this phase and the viral entry will be shortly followed with a strong ifn response which is critical for viral clearanceifns act through jakstat pathway to increase the expression of ifn response genes and type i ifns are the primary defense against viral infections 137 jak inhibitors interfere with antiviral immune response and increased risk of herpes zoster and simplex infections were previously reported with jak inhibitor use 138 since the effective containment and clearance of the virus depends on an effective and abrupt type i ifn response initiation of jak inhibitors at the early phase of covid-19 could interfere with the immune defense thus the jury is out for the benefit of these drugs in covid-19a cytokine storm similar to secondary hlhmas occurs in some patients with covid-19 huang et al have demonstrated that serum levels of several proinflammatory cytokines including il-1 il-6 and tnf- increased in the hyperinflammatory phase of covid-19 2 these data called for the use of drugs targeting cytokines mainly anti-il-6 anti-il-1 and anti-tnf as candidates for severe covid-19 treatmentzhou et al observed that il-6 levels were higher in deceased covid-19 patients than the survivors 21 other studies also reported elevation of il-6 levels in patients with severe covid-19 123 139 tocilizumab il-6 receptor monoclonal antibody use was associated with significant clinical improvement in several observational studies 140142 however there were no matched controls treated without tocilizumab in these studies in their retrospective casecontrol study 20 patients treated with tocilizumab versus 25 patients treated without tocilizumab klopfenstein et al reported that death andor intensive care unit admissions were higher among patients treated without tocilizumab than those treated with tocilizumab 72 versus 25 respectively 143 sciascia et al performed a pilot prospective single-arm study n  100 and they reported an improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters with tocilizumab treatment 144 moreover there are a few case reports on the successful use of tocilizumab in the treatment of severe childhood covid-19 145 146 based on these data anti-il-6 treatment is currently the most studied drug in the treatment of covid-19-associated cytokine storm nct04322773 nct04317092 nct04320615 nct04306705 nct04324073 nct04315298 chictr2000029765 chictr2000030796anti-il-1 drugs are also among the most promising therapies in cytokine storm associated with covid-19 in a recent retrospective cohort study cavalli et al evaluated anakinra treatment in covid-19 147 they compared the outcome between 16 patients who were on only standard treatment hcq and lopinavirritonavir in addition to mechanic ventilation and 29 patients who were taking high-dose intravenous iv anakinra in addition to the standard treatment and mechanic ventilation both overall survival and mechanic ventilation-free survival were more frequent in the high-dose anakinra group than the standard treatment group 90 versus 56 and 72 versus 56 respectively there are ongoing trials of anakinra in covid-19 that will probably provide a higher level of evidence for the efficacy of this treatment nct04324021 nct04330638 anti-il-1 treatment has indeed been suggested by some pediatric rheumatologists to be the first-line treatment 73there are also ongoing trials for anti-tnf use in covid-19 chictr2000030089 chictr2000030580 a combination of different biologic agents may also be considered in selected very severe casesin severe cases of secondary hlhmas anti-ifn- treatment is a critical therapeutic option there is also an ongoing trial of omapalumab anti-ifn- monoclonal antibody and anakinra in covid-19 nct04324021there are also other registered trials planned to test the efficacy of leflunomid ecluzimab and ruxolitinib 148 the readers are referred to the review by lythgoe et al summarizing all ongoing trials for the management of covid-19 pandemic 148in addition to this trial it is worth mentioning an open-label phase ii trial for colchicine use in covid-19 treatment 149at the moment all international rheumatology societies including acr american college of rheumatology eular european league against rheumatism and pres pediatric rheumatology european society recommend continuation of immunosuppressive treatment in patients with rheumatic diseases previous studies on sle and ra patients provided data on the increased rate of infections in cases of high disease activity 103 104 thus the primary aim should be an effective disease control in our patients with rheumatic diseasesa considerable amount of rheumatology patients are on drugs that are currently being tested for prophylaxis or treatment of covid-19 and it is difficult to predict the effects of being already on these treatments on infection rate and severityas discussed above there is a concern for more severe disease in patients using nsaids to be on the safe site nsaids may not be proposed as a primary treatment of rheumatic diseases or may be discontinued if they are not the primary drugs for disease control during covid-19 pandemic and for pain control acetaminophen could be selected over nsaidssince hcq is an immunomodulatory rather than immunosuppressive drug and it probably interferes with viral entry it might have a protective effect for patients treated with hcq however sle patients should not be considered resistant to covid-19 recently there are increasing reports of covid-19 patients with sle 28 30 32 41 mathian et al have reported the clinical picture of the course of covid-19 in sle patients treated with hcq 32 the authors concluded that hcq does not seem to prevent covid-19 at least its severe forms in patients with sle since most of the sle patients in this study received long-term treatment with hcq having blood concentrations of the drug within the therapeutic range the findings of konig et al were in the same lines as mentioned above 41the data about glucocorticoid use are also complex and challenging to interpret as pediatric rheumatologists we are always aiming to decrease glucocorticoid use and to keep the glucocorticoid dose as low as possible to control disease activity probably following the same principle will be logical until we get more evidencemost of the other drugs such as jak inhibitors anti-il-1 anti-il-6 and anti-tnf agents are immunosuppressives and these might interfere with the effective clearance of the virus at early phases of the disease thus being on these drugs at the early phase of infection could be a disadvantage for rheumatology patients on the other hand these drugs might prevent the development of a cytokine storm making a milder disease course possible currently there is not enough data about covid-19 disease course in patients with rheumatic diseases that are treated with biologic drugs table 1 in a survey study from italy filocamo et al reported that there was no confirmed covid-19 case among 123 pediatric patients on biologic dmards for chronic rheumatic diseases 156 current guidelines recommend continuing all immunosuppressive therapies providing disease control and proper patient education against the virusduring active covid-19 the immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued in most rheumatology patients 29 3235 another important topic is when to re-initiate these therapies in the case reports song et al 35 and mihai et al 33 the immunosuppressive therapies were re-initiated 24 days after a negative test result for covid-19 in their expert opinion article sarzi-puttini et al suggested that these drugs should be re-initiated only after two negative swabs 157last but not least how will our decisions be affected while initiating treatment for the patients that are newly diagnosed with a rheumatic disease during covid-19 pandemic if possible it may be recommended to test for sars-cov-2 before initiating biologics as we do for tuberculosis however the exact response to this question remains unknown currently this issue will also be a hot topic when the pandemic is over since we currently do not know about the possibility of latent disease in covid-19gupta et al performed a survey among rheumatologists in india to assess the attitudes of physicians while initiating anti-rheumatic therapies during covid-19 pandemic 158 they observed that almost 60 of the respondents preferred an earlier taper of glucocorticoids during inactive disease 665 of the respondents were more inclined to initiate hq in patients with borderline indications and almost half reduced the usage of biologic drugscovid-19 pandemic has a high mortality rate and a poorer outcome particularly in elderly patients and individuals with comorbidities there are very limited data about the infection rate and disease course in patients with rheumatic diseases and almost no data regarding pediatric rheumatology patients we should continue the medicines that control the disease activity in pediatric rheumatology patients since uncontrolled disease and high disease activity place patients to a higher risk group with regard to infections having said that one needs to decide on treatment on an individual basis considering personal risk factors it is critical not to reach early conclusions about the prophylactic effects of the drugs we currently use in pediatric rheumatology practice and although the disease mostly has a mild course in children children are not immune to covid-19 and different clinical manifestations such as kawasaki-like disease are being related to sars-cov-2 infection we should use the accumulating current scientific evidence and common sense while making decisions about the treatment of our patients and follow the primary prevention principles such as hand hygiene and social distancingthe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 broke out throughout the world now the total number of deaths has been over 88900 up to now the patients with confirmed covid-19 progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards rapidly in an incident rate as high as 418wu et al 2020 and many of them require mechanic ventilation in a cohort of an intensive care unit icu from italy 1287 cases need respiratory support and among them 88 of patients 1150 cases had to be supported with mechanical ventilationgrasselli et al 2020 apart from the desperate lacking of ventilator all over the world mechanical ventilation could also cause barotrauma and ventilator-associated lung injurycytokine storm has been disclosed as the main pathological characteristic of covid-19huang et al 2020 and it is also the direct pathogenic contributor to induce ards cytokines could be eliminated effectively by extracorporeal blood purification ebphonore et al 2019a which thus could interrupt the initiation and progression of inflammation cascade in the scenario of covid-19 accordingly there may be a chance of avoiding incubation and mechanical ventilation herein we report a case of severe sars-cov-2 infection with cytokine storm who was completely recovered from cytokine storm using extracorporeal blood purificationa 62- year- old male presented to the hospital with 8-day history of fever and 6-day history of cough and chest distress the patient had a history of gallstone he got fever on day 1 february 14 2020 and had chill headache muscle soreness fatigue nausea cough and chest distress and shortness of breath on day 3 then he was quarantined in a hotel being tested positive for sars-cov-2 on day 5 he received oseltamivir moxifloxacin and lianhua qingwen capsule chinese medicine in the outpatienthe was admitted to the hospital with fever cough and mild chest distress on day 9 arbidol hydroxychloroquine oseltamivir and lianhua qingwen capsule were administered supplemental oxygen was delivered by nasal cannula at 2 lmin alterations in hepatic function were showed levels of alanine aminotransferase 81 ul normal range 9-50 ul and aspartate aminotransferase 94 ul normal range 15-40 ul were elevated and cd3 and cd4 cell counts were markedly decreased supplemental table on day 10 chest ct indicated multiple ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs on day 11 supplemental figure 1 a-c the peak of temperature was 385 c up to date his vital signs remained clinically stable except oxygen saturation was 97 while providing oxygen at 3 lmin il-6 19866 pgml was almost 10 folds of normal range 59 pgml which indicated an initiation of cytokine storm on day 12 fig 1
 the ebp including double plasma molecular adsorption system bs330 and ha330ii jafron china and plasma exchange 2000 ml each was thus applied to remove the cytokines on day 13 the bs330 and ha330ii were installed in series after the plasma separator ec-4w asahi with a blood flow velocity of 80-100 mlmin and a separating speed of 20-25 mlmin and the duration of the treatments was 6 hours the plasma exchange was then conducted intravenous methylprednisolone 40 mg daily was used to suppress the inflammation reaction the patient was largely stable until the chest distress exacerbated and blood in phlegm developed on day 14 he then progressed to type i respiratory failure partial pressure of oxygen 51 mmhg partial pressure of carbon dioxide 32 mmhg with 89 oxygen saturation while the oxygen flow was 3 lmin high-flow oxygen 40 lmin was initiated to keep the oxygen saturation values between 96-99 hydroxychloroquine was discontinued due to a long qt interval the ebp therapy continued on days 14 and 15 respectivelythe patient was transferred into icu on day 15 given the acute inflammatory reaction methylprednisolone was improved to 60 mg twice daily and piperacillin-tazobactam 45 g administered intravenously every 8 hours was initiated concerning about the hospital-acquired pneumonia acetylcysteine was used to dilute the phlegm the human serum albumin and other supportive care were also administered the clinical condition of the patient was improved on day 16 and was stable thereafter and his hepatic function was back to normal as well the body temperature returned to normal on day 17 the igm of anti- sars-cov-2 was identified 7711 auml normal value  10 auml at the same day methylprednisolone was gradually reduced and discontinued on day 23 the lesions on chest ct was confined on day 17 and further alleviated on day 21 and almost disappeared on day 33 supplemental figure 1 low flow rate of oxygen 2 lmin was delivered instead of high-flow oxygen on day 26 then discontinued on day 36 he was asymptomatic at rest and had no shortness of breath while doing activity training his renal function was unaffected and immunoglobulin levels including igg igm iga and ige were normal throughout the clinical course complement c3 level was staying below the normal range 09-18 gl during the hospital duration supplemental table 1 c4 level 006 gl normal range 01-04 gl was reduced at day 16 and was back to normal 015 gl on day 31 the nucleic acid testing of sars-cov-2 was negative in four different times he was discharged on day 38the management of covid-19 in critical cases is still challenging nowadays respiratory and circulation supports such as mechanic ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo were almost the last defense for severe covid-19bartlett et al 2020 although specific methods to intervene the progression of critical cases are unknown the effects of ebp in treatment of covid-19 associated cytokine storm have not been emphasized the outcome of the present case of covid-19 with ards is promising pulmonary fibrosis was not observed up to dateebp was suggested to interrupt the inflammation cascade and stop the progression of cytokine storm in this case there were obvious peak levels of cytokines and bent over after the initiation of ebp on day 13 ha330 improved oxygenation and lung mechanics by removing circulating and alveolar cytokine levelshonore et al 2019b and bs330 adsorbed bilirubin so as to attenuate liver injurysu et al 2016the ebp that combined the double plasma molecular adsorption system and plasma exchange can directly reduce the cytokines although methylprednisolone was also administered synchronously it has been identified that the significant time point of il-6 reduce was the seventh day rather than the first three days in ardsahmad et al 2019 in addition there was a very short time window to manipulate the acute inflammatory state the patient turned to be unstable all of sudden without changes of clinical symptoms or subjective discomfort until day 14 fortunately we noticed the elevation of cytokine levels on day 12 therefore the proper time for intervention based on the levels of cytokines needs further validationsimilar features were found in this case as previous literaturesguan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 for instance low level of lymphocyte high level of cytokines and d-dimer more interestingly we found that the changes of fibrinogen degradation products fdps fig 1 were correlated with cytokines it returned to normal range even earlier than cytokines and d-dimer besides rising in the d-dimer over time was observed in non-survivors with more stable levels in survivorswang et al 2020 taken together employing fdps as sensitive marker of injury and prognosis of covid-19 is also warrantedthe present patient has completely recovered from severe covid-19 other factors should also be considered 1 no chronic complication and relative younger age 2 no development of other organ failure 3 the existence of antibody to sars-cov-2the prognosis of critical cases of covid-19 might be changed if the intervention of ebp was performed timely

ethical approval this study has been approved by qilu hospital cheeloo college of medicine shandong universitypathogenesis of covid-19 infection is a subject of active research however no effective therapy has yet been developed for this disease caused by the sars-cov-2 coronavirus initially sars-cov-2 infects upper respiratory tract epithelial cells if the infection is limited to these cells the disease usually manifests mild symptoms severe pneumonia can develop when the virus enters alveoli of the lungs and infects type ii pneumocytes the infection inhibits interferon response while upregulates expression of chemokines attracting immune cells monocytes b and t lymphocytes 1 excessive extravasation of these cells from the vessels into the alveoli is considered the main cause of pathogenic changes in the lungs leading to the development of respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 2in severe cases of covid-19 infection the virus can enter bloodstream and infect endothelial and other target cells in kidneys esophagus bladder ileum heart tissues and central nervous system the endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns damps released from the dead cells additionally activate immune cells and support development of the cytokine storm thus in severe forms of covid-19 infection multiple organ failure associated with hyperactivation of the immune system is observed patients with covid-19 infection in critical condition often have high systemic inflammatory parameters including levels of c-reactive protein and cytokines il-6 tnf il-8 etc 3-5increased generation of reactive oxygen species ros by immune cells and oxidative stress 6 inevitably accompanies the cytokine storm inflammatory cytokines and ros act together activating pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells this leads to disassembly of cell contacts increased permeability and influx of edematous fluid into alveoli resulting in an impaired gas exchange in the lungs in addition cytokine storm and oxidative stress lead to ros-dependent apoptosis of endothelial cells 7 which contributes to the release of coagulation factors and clot formation 8corticosteroids and inflammatory cascade inhibitors based on monoclonal antibodies are currently used for the treatment of the cytokine storm in covid-19 infection tocilizumab anti il-6 secukinumab anti il-17a canakinumab anti il-1 ruksolitinib phosphate jak kinase inhibitor etc 4 use of corticosteroids for treatment of covid-19 infection showed noticeable constraints related primarily to the suppression of specific immunity and an increased risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia 9 10 limitations of the monoclonal antibody therapy include their narrowly targeted action at only one of the many inflammatory cytokines thus it is extremely important to develop new approaches to prevent cytokine storm during the covid-19 infectionthe transcription factor nrf2 nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 is responsible for adaptation of cells under electrophilic or oxidative stresses under normal condition nrf2 is located in the cytoplasm bound to its inhibitor keap1 which targets nrf2 for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation in the presence of electrophiles or ros the keap1-nrf2 complex dissociates and nrf2 migrates to the nucleus where it stimulates transcription of the target genes with antioxidant response element sequences in their promoters 11 nrf2 controls expression of the genes participating in antioxidant response redox homeostasis biogenesis of mitochondria etc activation of these genes protects cells from inflammation 12 nrf2 stimulates expression of hemoxygenase ho-1 which is responsible for degradation of the pro-inflammatory free heme and formation of the anti-inflammatory compounds  co and bilirubin nrf2 also upregulates production of the antioxidant enzyme nadph quinone oxidoreductase nqo1 as well as of the key enzymes of glutathione biosynthesis which functions as the main cellular antioxidant nrf2 knockout mice suffer from an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction involving activation of innate immune cells increased production of cytokines chemokines and ros all these factors contribute to cell and tissue damage 13nrf2 activation results in suppression of inflammation not only through the antioxidant response but also through the nrf2 transcriptional repressor activity in human macrophages nrf2 inhibits expression of the inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 and tnf 14 it was shown in numerous animal inflammatory models that nrf2 inducers decreased circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines 12 15-17 protective role of the nrf2 activation in numerous inflammatory processes was also demonstrated for airway epithelium and vascular endothelium 18-22 dozens of clinical trials are currently underway to test the efficacy of nrf2 inducers for prevention and treatment of inflammatory and respiratory diseasesthe main facts and observations justifying feasibility of the nrf2 activation in treatment of covid-19 infection are summarized below1 excessive inflammation in covid-19 infection is associated with high lethality 3 activation of nrf2 reduces inflammatory response preventing expression of the inflammatory cytokines 14 and activation of the macrophage inflammasomes 23 24 nrf2 inducers also reduce inflammatory reactions in patients with acute and chronic diseases 252 ards is the main mortality factor in covid-19 patients 26 activation of nrf2 protects airway epithelium from disassembly of the intracellular tight junctions during inflammatory exposure and subsequent development of ards 273 an impaired vascular permeability is a key event in the covid-19 pathogenesis leading to endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis 28 induction of nrf2 protects vascular endothelium from damage caused by the oxidative stress or inflammatory cytokines 294 severe cases of covid-19 are accompanied by an increased oxidative stress 30 there are some cases of successful treatment of covid-19 with glutathione 31 key enzymes of glutathione biosynthesis are controlled by nrf2 32 the decrease of nrf2 activity promotes oxidative stress and nrf2 activation increases glutathione content in the body and restores redox balance in the organism 335 age is an important risk factor for severe covid-19 infection 34 nrf2 activity decreases with age 336 hyperglycemia is another risk factor in covid-19 infection 34 nrf2 activity is reduced in patients with hyperglycemia 357 mortality and severity of covid-19 infection is higher in men compared to women 34 sexual differences in nrf2 activity in humans are unknown but female mice have higher nrf2 activity compared to males 36so far no attempts have been made to investigate nrf2 inducers as the therapeutic drugs that reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in infections caused by sars-cov-2 this task can be solved by repurposing of the drugs or drug candidates that are able to activate nrf2 response a wide range of compounds can be used to activate nrf2 including the following1 sulforaphane is a plant-derived compound found in cruciferous plants such as broccoli and brussels sprouts the effect of sulforaphane on reducing circulatory inflammatory cytokines has been demonstrated in many animal models 37 currently about 70 clinical trials with sulforaphane are conducted targeting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma arthritis cancer and others sulforaphane is well tolerated orally in daily doses up to 200 mol reaching therapeutic plasma concentrations 382 dimethyl fumarate is a dimethyl ester of fumaric acid in the usa it has been approved by the fda for treatment of recurrent multiple sclerosis trade name tecfidera and in germany for psoriasis trade name fumaderm interestingly dimethyl fumarate reduces inflammatory reactions in both nrf2-dependent 39 and nrf2-independent ways 40 413 sodium thiosulfate is a drug used intravenously and orally it is a safe substance used to treat various intoxications sodium thiosulfate is a hydrogen sulfide h2s donor which is a nrf2 inducer hydrogen sulfide maintains redox balance of the cells and has an anti-inflammatory property 42 the compounds releasing h2s have anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities against a wide range of pathogenic viruses 43 a review paper has recently been published justifying the use of inhaled form of sodium thiosulphate for patients with covid-19 infection 444 epigallocatechin 3-gallate is a polyphenol found in green tea this non-toxic compound displays an anti-inflammatory activity both in vitro and in vivo 45 in addition epigallocatechin 3-gallate is an inhibitor of furin  a protease that processes sars-cov-2 s protein and facilitates virus penetration into the cell 46-485 resveratrol is a plant polyphenol resveratrol activates nrf2 by decreasing the expression of its negative regulator keap1 and activates sirt1 deacetylase 49 oral administration of resveratrol leads to the decrease in the levels of inflammatory cytokines il-1 and tnf and activation of the expression of nrf2 target genes nqo1 and glutathione s-transferase 50 resveratrol enhances synthesis of endogenous glutathione and protects alveolar epithelial cells from oxidative stress 51these drugs are mainly used to treat chronic rather than acute inflammatory conditions therapeutic efficacy of these nrf2 inducers is unknown for the cytokine storm and ards potentially nrf2 inducers can be used to prevent cytokine storm or during its manifestation in combination with already used anti-inflammatory drugsfor most of the proposed drugs toxicity and bioavailability are already known which allows for a quick start of the relevant clinical trials to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in covid-19 infection it seems reasonable to use nrf2 inducers together with glutathione biosynthesis precursors eg n-acetylcysteine this therapy can be used to reduce damage to cells and tissues to prevent respiratory failure and ardssars-cov-2 is a new member of the beta coronavirus its structural proteins consist of a spike s envelope e nucleocapsid n and membrane protein m among them s glycoprotein on the surface of the virus plays a significant role in adhesion and entry to host cells s proteins bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on the host cell surface 1 when the virus enters host cells by endocytosis translation of proteins and replication of rna occurred in the cytoplasm of these cells through the golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum system then with an attachment of vesicle containing viral particles to the cell membrane 2 the virus released and activated antigen-presenting cells apc which consequently stimulated humoral and cellular immunity systems as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk pathway and nf-kappa-b signaling pathway which regulated gene expression and altered immune cell differentiation 3 the result is pro-inflammatory cytokines release 4 unfolded protein production and er stress induction 5patients with sars-cov-2 infections which declared as covid-19 will probably develop different stages of the disease from asymptomatic to the mild stage with headache fatigue fever and diarrhea as well as the severe stage with an excessive decrease in lymphocyte count and failure of some vital organs frequently lungs 6 the exact pattern of immune system changes and their condition during the disease process is unclear 7diabetes mellitus dm is defined as abnormal glucose metabolisms and insulin functions it is well recognized as the result of a relative or absolute defect in insulin secretion and variable degrees of systemic insulin resistance the most common form of the dm is type two a heterogeneous complication attributed to insulin resistance with obesity oxidative stress and low-grade chronic inflammation as a background 8 9insulin is an anabolic hormone secreted by beta cells of the pancreas it is responsible for glycemic control by facilitating glucose utilization regulating nutrient hemostasis and stimulating gene expression cell survival and development metabolic actions of insulin have exerted differently in three primary target tissues with additional negative regulation of hormone-sensitive lipase activity insulin leads to a decrease in free fatty acid efflux from adipose tissues 10 11 12 in the lack of insulin sensitivity blood glucose elevated the anabolic action of insulin reduced the end products become glycosylated and oxidative stress increased insulin starts its function by binding to the extracellular alpha-subunit of insulin receptors insr at targeted tissues which induces intracellular beta-subunit autophosphorylationfurther it acted like the trigger of several intracellular signaling cascades through the downstream tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates irs1-4 leading to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pi3k growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 grb2 and mapk signaling pathways 11 12 the pi3k pathway activated several serinethreonine kinases like protein kinase b pkb is also known as akt 13 it largely contributed to insulin metabolic actions including glucose hemostasis lipid and protein synthesis as well as an anti-inflammatory response akt proteins are the major investigated serinethreonine kinases involving in insulin resistance which has realized that akt2 activation is reduced in adipocytes and skeletal muscle in dm type two leading to a higher inflammatory condition mapk pathway another intracellular signal is responsible for gene expression and affects the cell development and inflammatory cascades by intervening in the pi3k-akt pathway in certain conditions mapk can act as a serine protease of irs and interfere with insulin signaling through an inappropriate activation 11insulin resistance and obesity are the major features of dm type two denoted as an insufficient response of targeted tissues to insulin 14 the exact mechanism of insulin resistance is not yet determined but the insidious role of inflammation underlying obesity insulin resistance and dm suggested by several studies 13 understanding the hypoglycemic effect of salicylate an anti-inflammatory agent via the inhibition of the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-b kinase ikk is the origin of such studies 13 15 subsequent researches have further highlighted the positive relationship between inflammation and insulin resistance they have also identified obesity as an essential factor in the development of insulin resistance and dm type two 13 the downregulation of insulin receptors has seen in obesity leading to decrease insulin sensitivity 10 irs1 is a common mediator which attributed to insulin signaling dysregulation 12 reduced levels of irs1 are also associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia can reduce the irs expression by negative transcription regulating 16 suppressors of cytokine signaling socs are inflammatory proteins overwhelming irs inflammation activates the socs1 and socs3 which induce ubiquitination and finally disintegration of irs proteins 12 17 activation of the insulin receptor stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of irs1 directing the signal transduction while the two major inflammatory pathways inhibit signal propagation by serine kinase activity 12 as previously mentioned the nf-kappa-b pathway plays a crucial role in an inflammatory response silenced by nf-kappa-b inhibitor i-kappa-b in resting cells and can fulminate by serine phosphorylation activity of ikk on i-kappa-b results in i-kappa-b degradation in inflammatory condition 13 15 ikk subset signaling has a close association with obesity and metabolic disorders 15 c-jun nh2-terminal kinase jnk1 is another serine kinase that involves inflammatory signals through the jnkap-1 pathways which also regulates the nf-kappa-b process 12 13in docking analysis of cd26 and covid-19 s glycoprotein conducted by vankadari et al a significant interaction between the proteins was found 18 dpp4 or cd26 is the main receptor for mers-cov which caused the transmission of various species and humans 19in recent years the role of dpp4 in chronic inflammation has been proved dpp4 or cd26 is a glycoprotein on the cell surface with 110-kda molecular weight 20 dpp4 activity has been shown in mice rats and humans and is present in the kidney intestine lungs liver lymph node thymus prostate spleen monocytes epithelial cell and lymphocyte 21 macrophages natural killer nk cells b cells and t cells express the dpp4 protein this protein is multifunctional and involved in cytokine production dna synthesis signaling activation and cell proliferation 20 interferons upregulate the expression of dpp4 il12 and tumor necrosis factor tnf-alpha are involved in the dpp4 translation and translocation cd26 has a role in regulating the migration and maturation of cd4 t-cell antibody production cytokine secretion and immunoglobulin class switching but the exact role of this protein in immune cells is not clear cd26t cells have a strong ability to migrate via endothelial cells 22dpp4 can also interact with caveolin-1 on apc an integral protein on the membrane of smooth muscle cells macrophages and endothelial cells dpp4 and caveolin-1 interaction lead to carma1-lipid rafts carma1 belongs to the maguk family caspase recruitment domain 11-containing membrane-associated kinase whose role is the regulation of nf-kappa-b activation in lymphocytes 20 the dimerization of cd26 is essential for its binding to carma1 the interaction of carma1-dimeric cd26 is via the cytoplasmic tail of the second one this binding of apc to cd26 causes caveolin-1 phosphorylation and interleukin-1 receptor-associated serinethreonine kinase 1 irak-1 and toll-interacting protein tollip dissociation from caveolin-1 22 both irak-1 and tollip are involved in the toll-like receptor tlr signaling pathway 20 afterward the phosphorylation of irak-1 is occurred and activates nf-kappa-b 22 this activation may cause tnf-alpha secretion and consequently jnk activation parallel nf-kappa-b activation induces m1 macrophage and then different interleukins secretion including il1 il6 and il12 fig 1 22 likewise the secretion of tnf-alpha caused by nf-kappa-b during the inflammation activates dpp4 which causes the migration and maturation of cd4 t-cell especially th1 th17 and cytokine secretion dpp4 probably also has a role in the induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 hif-1 alpha 22 which exaggerates the inflammation fig 1so dpp4 has a different role in the immune system such as inflammation-related disease immune responses and t cell activation it also enhances inflammation through the tlr pathway dpp4 inhibitors like sitagliptin affect adipocytes and macrophages as an anti-inflammatory agent 23 the inhibition of dpp4 reduces inflammation intensity in different states 24the severe stage of the covid-19 is associated with lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm which caused multi-organ damage 7 therefore identification of the state of the immune cells and the dominant mechanisms for the production of cytokines that incorporate in the cytokine storm can be an important step in the therapeutic approach some studies identified that diabetic patients are at a higher risk for covid-19 infections 25 due to that dpp4 expressed on the different cell surfaces dpp4 inhibitors in addition to the anti-diabetic effect can inhibit t cell proliferation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce the severity of inflammation sitagliptin is a dpp4 inhibitor that can reduce inflammatory response 26 interestingly the docking studies have also suggested an additional association of dpp4 with s glycoproteins of the new coronavirus 18 in addition to the fact that the inflammatory mediators are active in individuals with covid-19 and blocking the predominant pathway could be beneficial the present hypothesis suggests a new therapeutic approach by linking the covid-19 pathogenesis with diabetes and potential sitagliptin mechanisms at the molecular levelsapcs like dendritic cells present viral antigens to t cells and play a significant role in the immunity system that leads to the production of cytokines and activation of cd8 t cells the innate immune system includes macrophage dendritic cells neutrophils and t cells that express pattern recognition receptors prrs like tlr for detecting viral and microbial compartments 4 19 dysregulation of the immune system like inflammatory cytokine storm and lymphopenia has been confirmed in the severity of coronaviruses 27 however inflammation is a proper biological response to pathogens and the inflammatory responses can also act as a double aged sword in infection conditions 28 in covid-19 infection changes in the immune system can cause deregulation in the immune system and higher expression of inflammatory pathways especially nf-kappa-b that induces the further production of pro-inflammatory cytokines via the different mechanisms leading to the cytokine storms increased pro-inflammatory cytokines level in the lungs prevents proper function of lungs and possibly causes lung failure 19 29 the stimulus of inflammation initiated by receptors activation and then developed within the intracellular signaling like the nf-kappa-b pathway i-kappa-b protein is an inhibitor of nf-kappa-b activation presenting in the cytoplasm under the physiological state whereas in the inflammatory condition prrs activates ikk an inhibitor kinas of i-kappa-b leads to the i-kappa-b degradation and eventually causes the translocation of nf-kappa-b to the nucleus to induce transcription of inflammatory genes 30 activation of nf-kappa-b signaling is responsible for the induction of the nave t cell activation and proliferation which leads to the induction of chemokine expression and additionally the inflammatory effect of different innate immune cells and tcr t cell receptor signaling 31 the pro-inflammatory effect of nf-kappa-b on macrophage was extremely studied activated macrophages have different phenotypes including m2 activated alternatively and m1 macrophage m2 phenotype can produce anti-inflammatory cytokines like il10 and il13 but the m1 form produces inflammatory cytokines like il1 il1beta il 6 il12 tnf-alpha and il8 and involve in different inflammatory conditions 32 il6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that triggers the nf-kappa-b pathway and allows it to translocate transcript and finally release inflammatory mediators 20 the nf-kappa-b pathway is an essential transcription factor for the induction of the m1 phenotype of macrophage and essential for the expression of pro-inflammatory genes that encode il1beta il6 tnf-alpha cyclooxygenase two and il12 33 nf-kappa-b induces differentiation of inflammatory t cells to consist of th1 and th17 that mediate inflammatory response and involved in different autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions th1 secretes interferon-gamma ifn-gamma which contributes to inflammatory processes nf-kappa-b promotes secretion of cytokines by affecting the tcr signaling which increases the differentiation of th1 cells 34 th17 secrete il17 which recruits neutrophils and monocytes to the site of inflammation the aberrant activation of the nf-kappa-b pathway stimulates tlr to produce il6 which induce th17 differentiation and increase the production of ifn-gamma and il1beta with t cells 31 34 as mentioned above tlrs are the members of the prps group that involved in the activation of inflammatory processes tlrs signaling activates the intracellular signaling processes and leads to the nf-kappa-b translocation to the nucleus 35 patients with covid-19 have multi-organ damages like liver heart and kidney disorders and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in a severe stage that cause acute lung disorders pulmonary edema and consecutively failure of lungs a life-threatening condition these events are involved with cytokine storms cytokine storms increased expressions of cytokines like il2 il6 il8 il9 il17 il1beta granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor gm-csf granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf il10 macrophage inflammatory protein 1a mip1a mip1b and tnf-alpha in the serum of patients at the later stage of the disease icu patients had a large account of il2 il10 il7 tnf-alpha mipa and monocyte chemo attract protein-1 mcp1 compared to non-icu patients 27 it has been clear that sever cases of covid-19 patients with higher neutrophillymphocyte had a higher level of inflammatory cytokines like il6 il1 but a lower account of cd4t cells level compared to covid-19 patients with a lower ratio of neutrophillymphocyte 36 in the peripheral blood of covid-19-patients the number of lymphocytes decreased but they are in the excessive activated status in this condition activated cd8 t cells have a higher expression level of cd44 cd69 and cd38 but activated cd4 t cells have a higher level than healthy control individuals 3 37as a presence of low-grade chronic inflammation in diabetes the nf-kappa-b pathway is almost always excited elevated nf-kappa-b pathway expression in diabetes affects the immune system in such patients diabetic patients could also suffer from high levels of th1 and th17 which can explode the inflammatory cascade in an uncontrolled manner 3 activation of the innate immune system in adipose tissue has been suggested in connection with inflammation obesity and diabetes 38 weight gain causes adipose tissue remodeling and expansion with inadequate supporting of vasculature leading to higher oxygen supply and consequently trigger cellular hif-1 to promote inflammation state 12 as a part of inflammation state adipokines may alter where mcp1 mip il8 il6 il1beta and tnf-alpha are increased as well as adiponectin and il10 are less secreted 38 39 these higher factors will activate adipose tissue macrophages and t cells leading to the release of more pro-inflammatory chemokine to attract other immune cells 40 41 various evidence has indicated that adipose tissue macrophages play a major role and confront inflammation in the metabolic organs it is also determined that predominantly anti-inflammatory m2-type macrophages are transformed into pro-inflammatory m1-macrophages in the obese population 13 42 ikk plays a vital role in both obesity and metabolic disorders and is also involved in interferon signaling which is essential for fighting with viral infections 15 enhanced production of ifn-gamma in adipose and hepatic tissue may also cause insulin resistance contributing to the switch from m2 macrophages to the m1 phenotype 42 free fatty acids are also able to promote nf-kappa-b by tlr24 activation leading m1-subset to overcome 12 15 one of the most co-existing complications of diabetes is obesity-induced insulin resistance it has a major role in ongoing inflammation via the macrophage switching to m1 type the release of various cytokine especially il6 and tnf-alpha increase th1 and th17 cells stimulation of tlr24 and finally activation of ikk fig 1 macrophages can also exert their inflammatory responses via jnk-1 signaling an important component of obesity-induced insulin resistance 12 pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf-alpha and il6 disturb the insulin action which consequently leads to systemic and local insulin resistance 43 tnf-alpha impairs insulin function by irs1 tyrosine phosphorylation blockade in adipose and muscle tissue 44generally it has been reported that patients with dm are more susceptible to viral infections and covid-19 is no exception 45 there are various reasons why diabetic patients are more likely to develop covid-19 symptoms and progress to more complications patients with dm have shown to have increased receptor expression more virus entry impaired immunity response decreased phagocytic activity reduced viral elimination dysregulated inflammatory cytokines and higher susceptibility to hyperinflammatory states accordingly a closer look at each of these mechanisms could reveal a way to treat covid-19 not only in the diabetic population but for all patients diabetes has been associated with a higher risk of sars-cov-2 infection and complications and new clinical challenges exhibited in controlling of the covid-19 in diabetes 46 47 epidemiological documentations have declared severe clinical manifestation and more complications in patients with covid-19 and co-morbid diabetes 25 the chronic state of low-grade inflammation and increased formation of glycosylated end products and oxidative reactive stress may contribute to the enhanced susceptibility of individuals with diabetes one of the suggesting sites of intervention between diabetes and covid-19 is ikk with a particular relative role on nf-kappa-b signaling as well as simultaneously association with insulin resistance and viral infection combat chronic expression of ikk in diabetes shows the double burden of diabetes and viral infections 15 although there is a basal inflammatory activity among the diabetic hosts the strong clinical evidence has supported delayed and dysregulated inflammatory signals followed by impaired immune responses aligned with inflammation ace2 expression and furin level the two important binding mediators who mediate the virus entry and initiate viral pathogenesis have been augmented in diabetic hosts 46 47 the altered glucose metabolism and oxidative stress have directly impaired phagocytic activity of neutrophils and macrophages 48 together with defective apc recruitment and function the initiation of adaptive immunity delayed in diabetic populations a unique cytokine profile in the diabetic state also modifies the acquired immunity through both arms in t-cell subset cd4 th1 th17 and cd8 cytotoxic t cells ctl are up-regulated whereas cd4 th2 and regulatory t treg cells are diminished 48 49 treg cells have an important role in immunological tolerance the cd4 involved in the auto-reactive t cells suppression and in vivo studies showed that they prevented the progression of diabetes 50 diabetes also delays the b-cells activation which may have considerable regulatory effects on the other functional immune response 48the bold role of dpp4 in different disorders like inflammation cancer immune disease and diabetes put dpp4 inhibitors in the spotlight 22 on the other hand the parallel analysis of covid-19 and diabetes mellitus pathogenesis has proposed that the control of the inflammation through the interfering with the critical points of major signaling pathways may provide the new therapeutic approaches sitagliptin is a dpp4-inhibitor a class of oral diabetic agents for treating diabetes mellitus type two 51 they are in the market since 2006 patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease who consumed sitagliptin had a better inflammatory state 21 dpp4 inhibitors may have the anti-inflammatory effect independent of their effect on glp-1 level dpp4 inhibitors are supposed to decrease the expression of cd26 on the immune cell surface which led to the inhibition of innate immune system activity some data suggest that the positive role of dpp4 inhibitors like sitagliptin in controlling the inflammation is due to the increase of glp-1on the other hand some studies believe that dpp4 inhibitors adjust the activity of the innate immune system and t-cell activation and act as an anti-inflammatory agent 20 alogliptin a dpp4 inhibitor inhibited the inflammation mediated by macrophage due to the presence of lps in u937 cells in nga et al study 52 sitagliptin reduces the inflammation mostly by affecting on nf-kappa-b signaling pathway 53 it also decreases apoptosis wholly partially suppresses il1beta and il6 levels 20 and inhibits tnf-alpha secretion dose-dependently in vitro 21 makdissi et al proved the anti-inflammatory effect of sitagliptin in humans for the first time sitagliptin suppressed the nf-kappa-b and the expression of cd26 and tlr-2 at time 2 hours the nf-kappa-b suppression may decrease m1 macrophages activity nave t cells and innate immune cells that finally lead to the reduction of the inflammatory condition and prevent the progression of the diseases and the occurrence of cytokine storm inflammation the suppression of cd26 maintained at week 12 as well as the expression of tnf-alpha jnk-1 and tlr4 a receptor for lipopolysaccharide was suppressed at week 12 suppressing tlr2 and tlr4 leads to nf-kappa-b suppression besides the plasma concentration of il6 and c-reactive protein decreased in week four and two respectively 24covid-19 is becoming a global health threat due to being highly contagious and is leading to mortality rates covid-19 patients who reached the late sever stages developed the remarkable lymphocytopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm which caused multi-organ damage pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 infection shows an immune system dysregulation with the major role of a well-known inflammatory pathway nf-kappa-b the nf-kappa-b involves the defective cycle which induces inappropriate cd4t cell differentiation and more inflammatory signals that causes the systemic inflammatory condition and various organs to be involved with pro-inflammatory cytokines and consecutively lead to cytokine storm on the other hand diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder closely associated with obesity and insulin resistance it has been revealed that the inflammatory process has an ambiguous role in diabetes onset and development it is considering the fact that diabetic patients are more likely to contract covid-19 infection signaling analysis of diabetes-inflammation linkage indicates the persistent nf-kappa-b activity and low grade chronic inflammatory state among the diabetic populationas the control of the inflammation is an important step in both covid-19 and diabetes mellitus treatment modulating the macrophage transformation and t cell differentiation via the suppression of dpp4 tnf-alpha and tlr24 are parallel approaches which are added to the direct nf-kappa-b suppression due to the different role of dpp4 in the immune system such as inflammation-related disease immune responses and t cell activation especially th1 and th17 which have an inflammatory effect dpp4 inhibitors are considered useful as discussed this drug class can meet all of the above anti-inflammatory goals owning to their effects on the immune system the drug inhibitory effect on various interleukins and cytokines such as il6 il1beta and tnf-alpha has been approved in different in vitroin vivo studies the recent evidence of sars-cov-2 docking analysis which has interestingly shown the interaction of s glycoprotein and dpp4 receptors magnifies the dpp4 inhibitors role more than before sitagliptin decreases the inflammation via suppressing main inducers and different characters in the nf-kappa-b signaling pathway hence dpp4 inhibitors like sitagliptin should be a good candidate for controlling the inflammationthe authors declare no conflicts of interestthe emerging and re-emerging viruses ebola zika chikungunya h1n1 dengue sars mers have led to numerous global public health crises in recent years and continue to threaten public health and security unfortunately these viruses are often difficult to control due to the lack of approved antiviral drugs and vaccines in addition to sars-cov2 two other novel coronaviruses have emerged as global health threats since 2002 namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002 that was transmitted to 37 countries and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 that was transmitted to 27 countries severe pneumonia caused by pathogenic human coronaviruses hcov are often associated with induced hypercytokinemia also termed cytokine storm in immunocompetent individuals uncontrolled overproduction of inflammatory cytokines contributes to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome ardsthe secretion of multiple cytokines also termed cytokine release syndrome crs is closely related to development of clinical symptoms for example ifn- can cause fever chills headaches dizziness and fatigue tnf- can cause flu-like symptoms similar to ifn- with fever general malaise and fatigue but can also cause vascular leakage cardiomyopathy lung injury and acute-phase protein synthesis 4 il-6 which is an important target in crs induced by adoptive cell therapy can lead to vascular leakage activation of complement and the coagulation cascade leading to the characteristic symptoms of severe crs such as diffuse intravascular coagulation dic 56 it is noteworthy that il-6 is likely to cause cardiomyopathy by promoting myocardial dysfunction which is often observed in patients with crs 7 in addition activation of endothelial cells may also be one of the hallmarks of severe crs endothelial dysfunction can lead to capillary leakage hypotension and coagulopathy 8 fig 1
 taken together these studies argue that the virus-induced immunopathological events play a crucial role in the fatal pneumonia observed after hcov infections 9the development of a cytokine storm is a potentially fatal immune condition characterized by rapid proliferation and hyperactivation of t cells macrophages natural killer cells and the overproduction of more than 150 inflammatory cytokines and chemical mediators released by immune or nonimmune cells 1011 in viral infections the aberrant release of pro-inflammatory factors leads to lung epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis which damages the lung microvascular and alveolar epithelial cell barrier leading to vascular leakage alveolar edema and hypoxia the uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory factors containing il-6 il-8 il-1 and gm-csf and chemokines such as ccl2 ccl-5 ip-10 and ccl3 together with reactive oxygen species cause ards leading to pulmonary fibrosis and death 12in sars-cov infected patients high levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn- il-1 il-6 il-12 and tgf and chemokines ccl2 cxcl10 cxcl9 and il-8 were detected in cases of severe disease compared to patients with uncomplicated sars 13 in mers infection high levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6 and ifn- and chemokines il-8 cxcl- 10 and ccl5 were likewise observed in severe disease compared to mild or moderate disease 14 in contrast to sars and mers doctors in wuhan central south hospital found that the levels of il2 il7 il10 gscf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf  were significantly elevated in the blood of severely ill patients compared to patients with mild illness 2 the level of il-6 in the blood of the severe group was 76  higher than that of the mild group 30  15 furthermore histological examination and biopsy samples obtained from a patient who died from severe sars-cov-2 infection showed an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory ccr4ccr6 th17 cd4 t cells suggesting that t cell hyperactivation contributesdin part to the severe immune injury in this patient 16 pulmonary examination in other patients with early phase sars-cov-2 pneumonia also revealed patchy inflammatory cell infiltration however the pathological results in early stage of sars-cov2 pneumonia require further confirmation 17 in short aberrant release of multiple cytokines appears to trigger a cytokine storm that produces immunopathogenic damage to tissues and organs even while the immune response seeks to suppress and eradicate the virus fig 1in view of the above observations therapeutic strategies to treat the cytokine storm in the pathogenesis of severe covid-19 pneumonia deserve special attention in accordance with current who guidance 18 supportive therapy remains the most important management strategy for this pneumonia including supplemental oxygen therapy conservative fluid management and empiric antimicrobial application in the time of need it is noteworthy that the use of glucocorticoids remains controversial current who guidance recommends that corticosteroids should not be used in sars-cov2-induced lung injury or shock except in the setting of a clinical trial however in clinical settings front-line physicians in china tend to use corticosteroids prudently at a low to moderate dosage in patients with sars-cov2 infection 19in the period of sars epidemic 20022003 corticosteroids were generally used by clinicians for immunomodulatory treatment and according to clinical feedback could bring early beneficial changes including a decline in fever resolution of radiographic lung infiltrates and the improvement of oxygenation 2021 however further studies indicated opposite clinical outcomes and a systematic review in sars mers and influenza infections indicated no survival benefit and possible harm avascular necrosis psychosis diabetes delayed viral clearance and secondary infections with corticosteroids 22 in our opinion the use of corticosteroids is not recommended for patients with hcov infections although corticosteroids may be used prudently in critically ill patientsone strategy that has received considerable attention in the face of covid-19 is the use of convalescent plasma also called passive antibody therapy to treat patients with advanced disease the treatment uses plasma from a patient who has survived covid-19 infection to provide neutralizing antibodies against the virus the antibodies are available and active immediately but only for a limited time as an example of one study five patients critically ill with covid-19 and on mechanical ventilation received convalescent plasma 1022 days after being admitted to a hospital in shenzhen china all patients improved three were discharged after 50 days in hospital while the other two patients were in stable condition well controlled clinical evaluation of this strategy is currently ongoing in light of such positive anecdotal responsesanother potential treatment involves the use of anti-il-6 monoclonal antibody siltuximab johnson  johnson which was used previously to treat the consequences of cytokine storm following by car-t cell therapy for cancer interleukin-6 il-6 has become a key point in some crs originally described as b-cell differentiation factor-2 bsf-2 and macrophage and granulocyte induction factor-2 mgi-2 il-6 has significant pro-inflammatory and pyrogenic properties and given chronic overproduction in covid-19 patients anti-il-6 monoclonal antibody may be beneficial in controlling cytokine release also il-17 inhibitor secukinumab novartis was used as specific treatment for severe patients with covid-19 pneumonia 25 to control th17 cell activation an additional observation indicated that the expression levels of cd4 t and cd8 t were low while il-6 levels were high in patients with severe pneumonia suggesting that t cell subsets and cytokine levels could be used as one predictor of the transition from mild to severe pneumonia 15pegylated and non-pegylated interferons ifn have been under intensive study for some time however in the case of hcov infection the results of ifn therapy were mixed as predicted by animal and human hcov infection models early application of ifn was slightly beneficial to reduce viral load and improve clinical outcome however delayed ifn administration was of no benefitscompared with the placebo group early application of ifn and ribavirin moderately improved disease severity without affecting mortality 26 the use of sifalimumab monoclonal antibody produced against multiple ifn subtypes medimmune has not been examined clinically but could hold promise in situations of constitutive ifn productionthe early use of ifn had some beneficial effects in sars-cov-infected animal model although the timing of ifn treatment was crucial in determining the course of disease the use of ifn- receptor inhibitors or antagonists could be considered as an approach to avoid excessive inflammatory reactions in late stage severe hcov infection 27 since sars-cov and mers-cov infect mainly airway epithelial cells and ifn- stimulates antiviral gene expression in these cells without over-stimulating the immune system ifn- might be a option in the therapy of hcov infectionoxidized phospholipids oxpl have been demonstrated to promote acute lung injury by increasing the production of cytokineschemokines from lung macrophages via tlr4-trif signaling in influenza a virus iav-infected mice 28 in a recent study therapeutic administration of the tlr4 antagonist eritoran protected mice from lethal iav infection by decreasing the levels of oxpl and inflammatory cytokineschemokines 29 because pathogenic human coronaviruses can cause acute lung injury and promote the production of oxpl in the lungs the strategies of oxpl suppression by using eritoran boc sciences or other similar compounds may have value in controlling hcov induced inflammationsignal transduction by the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 s1p1 in mouse endothelial cells nfected with influenza a virus has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammation responses 30 targeted s1p1 antagonism inhibited the recruitment of inflammatory cells limited pro-inflammatory cytokinechemokine release and reduced mortality and morbidity induced by influenza a virus 31 s1p1 antagonism may be considered a potential therapy in hcov-infected individuals to limit cytokine responsesthe results of studies in animal models have borne out claims that imms paly pathogenic roles in the process of fatal hcov infections in the mice cardiac inflammation model the systemic administration of optimized lipid nanoparticles including ccr2-silenced small interfering rna sirna can effectively degrade ccr2 mrna and destroy the imm recruitment in the inflammatory site thus improving the outcome of the disease 32 because hcovs are single-chain rna viruses and tlr7 agonist r837 a synthetic single-chain rna analog stimulates imms which causes exuberant inflammatory response therefore imm specific tlr-7 signal may promote the excessive inflammatory response caused by hcov infection therefore a tlr7 antagonist targeted approach to alleviate inflammation reaction could be usefulcontinuous renal replacement therapy crrt may benefit severe patients by removing potentially harmful components and maintaining haemodynamic and metabolic status in addition to the conventional aim of maintaining renal function crrt can be used to regulate the immune response of patients with sepsis with the goal to regulate circulating levels of inflammatory cytokine mediators as shown in studies demonstrating removal of inflammatory mediators containing cytokines and complement tnf il-1 il-6 il-8 complement factors c3a c5a and d by crrt 35 at present there is a need for well-designed clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of such a treatment regimenafter covid-19 infection some patients develop systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs and mods characterized by the uncontrolled release of inflammatory mediators giving rise to a cytokine storm that contributes to increased mortality in ards in summary further experimentations is required to understand the changes in the immune response of patients with covid-19 infection and the mechanisms of abnormal cytokine expression in covid-19 pneumonia accurate prediction and targeted intervention during the course of covid-19 pneumonia will be essential to improve patient survival fig 2there are no financial or other interests with regard to the paper that represent a conflict of interest3334coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 has now infected over 2 million people worldwide with a death toll of more than 125000 people emerging risk factors for poor outcomes in this disease include age male sex and cardiovascular comorbidities including hypertension prior cardiovascular disease diabetes and more recently obesity 1 the centers for disease control and prevention atlanta georgia has now reported a threefold increase in death in new orleans compared with new york and speculation has grown as to whether these worrying mortality statistics might in part be attributable to higher levels of morbid obesity 2 in this paper we develop a theoretical framework that describes why individuals with obesity may be at increased risk of poor outcomes compared with counterparts without obesity 3 we propose a mechanism for adverse consequences of virus seeding to adipose tissue at with potential for prolonged viral shedding and extended cytokine activation in a voluminous and richly vascularized organ that is already perturbed in a metabolic and inflammatory sense in human individuals with obesity 4 we present a rationale for testing this concept in patients with covid19 through prospective studies of individuals with and without obesity with accessible at and plasma to determine whether or not an inflammatory and cytokine signature presages a systemic cytokine storm and clinical declineobesity was not specifically reported in the initial cohort studies of covid19 from wuhan china 5 but regional epidemiological data from the united states suggests that at least 25 of patients who die of this disease have obesity which is similar to reported rates of cardiovascular disease in the same highrisk group 21 6 more recently a small retrospective study of 85 individuals with covid19 identified obesity as a risk factor for admission to the intensive care unit with patients requiring increased medical attention 3 moreover in the influenza a subtype h1n1 pandemic obesity was also strongly associated with a worse disease outcome and death 7 together these data raise the questions of whether there is a mechanistic link between obesity and disease survival and whether obesity over and above its endocrine or cardiometabolic associations might independently contribute to covid19 riskit is clear that obesity could contribute to both diabetic and cardiovascular covid19 risk and these elements of risk in addition to thrombosis more recently have been well described in the scientific literature 8 9 10 11 12 moreover obesity is an independent risk factor for hypoventilation syndrome in patients in the intensive care unit 13 and could thus contribute to respiratory failure in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome 14 here we propose additional unheralded pathophysiologic aspects of increased at burden in morbid obesity that may amplify the proinflammatory response to extensive viral infection at should be viewed as a highly active organ interfacing immune endocrine and metabolic homeostasis throughout the body 15 in individuals with obesity there is marked dysregulation of myeloid and lymphoid responses within at with associated dysregulation of cytokine profiles 15 intrinsically bound to this are endocrine and metabolic derangements including insulin resistance and adipokine dysregulation with dysfunctional lipid and fatty acid metabolism 16 in highly vascularized at endothelial and smoothmuscle cells as well as resident macrophages exhibit additional perturbations in response to an activated renin angiotensin system at a local level with attendant depletion and dysfunction of the counterregulatory angiotensin converting enzyme 2 mas receptor system 17 18 this makes at particularly in visceral distributions proimmunogenic metabolically active and highly integrated into the cardiovascular system with the capability to drive acute disease through augmented inflammation at an organ level in the heart vasculature pancreas liver and kidneys 19 this preactivation state of at in obesity makes this organ a potential target for further immune amplification by external pathogens such as virusescurrently there is no evidence for direct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 infection of at although angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor expression represents a basis for viral tropism in several cells within this tissue 20 including adipocytes smoothmuscle cells and endothelial cells 21 moreover many atresident cells are proven targets for multiple viruses including adipocytes h1n1 type a influenza and adenovirus 36 7 22 23 adipostromal cells adenovirus 36 24 cytomegalovirus 25 endothelial cells sarscov 26 macrophages influenza a sarscov adenovirus36 human immunodeficiency virus 26 27 and lymphocytes sarscov human immunodeficiency virus 25 26 although sarscov2 was detected only at low levels in blood in a small human study 28 we cannot exclude hematogenous spread to at given the very high virus affinity for its target cell receptor alternative routes of sarscov2 spread to at include local egress of the virus from organs known to be infected to adjacent visceral fat deposits such as intrathoracic fat lungs epicardial fat heart perirenal fat kidneys and mesenteric fat intestines finally shared viral tropism for lung epithelium and at has already been shown for h5n1 virus infection 29 and at significantly prolongs the duration of viral shedding in humans with obesity infected with influenza 22 were similar tropism of sarscov2 to occur within at of individuals with covid19 and obesity there exists the potential for prolonged viral shedding in this organ with extended activation of local preactivated immune systems and resident cytokine signaling pathwaysresident myeloid and lymphoid cells are plentiful in at and obesity is associated with macrophage 30 and lymphocyte dysfunction 31 expansion of distinct memory t lymphocytes within at can also activate aberrant immune responses with wider tissue damage on viral challenge 31 a recent report from wuhan suggests that sarscov2 induces a dysregulated immune response in severely ill individuals with covid19 32 characterized by reduced numbers of circulating memory t lymphocytes as well as reduced helpersuppressor and regulatory tcell subtypes it is tempting to speculate whether already dysfunctional immune responses in individuals with obesity may accentuate this sarscov2 effect on tcell functionspecific inflammatory cytokine programs such tumor necrosis factor tnf interleukin il1 and il6 are known to be preactivated in at in the context of obesity 33 and thus viral infection may similarly amplify the already primed organ cytokine response in at the cytokine storm identified in multiple respiratory viral infections including covid19 exhibits diverse interferon il chemokine tnf and colonystimulating factor responses which are beyond the scope of this paper but are comprehensively reviewed elsewhere 34 the intensity of inflammatory lung responses reflect the imbalance between proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf and il1 and their soluble cognate receptors that inhibit cytokine effects in aqueous phase 35 il10 produced by macrophages and t lymphocytes t helper 2 and regulatory t cells acts as a negative regulator of inflammation whereas il6 and its soluble receptor enhance activity of il6 on target cells providing a mechanism for enhancement of tnf and il1 activity when these soluble cognate receptors are particularly high 35 thus a balance between pro and antiinflammatory mechanisms is critical in maintaining lungtissue homeostasis it is conceivable that if one or more of these regulatory elements were absent or dysfunctional then it might contribute to a cytokine storm in the lung or in other tissues such as at where aberrant cytokine activation exists temporal studies of cytokine dynamics in human cytokine storm models show that il6 sustains activation of multiple cytokine pathways for many days after the initial immune insult 36 interestingly in early covid19 studies il6 was a strong independent predictor of mortality 37 human at is a major source of il6 and its receptor il6r 38 and thus at may provide a reservoir for il6 activation and cascade signaling in viral infection figure 1 viral spread from affected organs to adjacent at may take days with subsequent prolonged viral shedding contributing to the delayed cytokine storm and consequences for tissue injury in patients with covid19initial studies should aim to detect sarscov2 in at on autopsy of individuals who have died of covid19 focus should be on analysis of specific cells that have evidence of infection by immunocytopathic and in situ viral detection techniques parallel studies should identify whether specific cell types in at can support sarscov2 infection and replication ex vivo with respect to the cytokine storm an integratedsystems biology approach would enable multiple pathways to be assessed simultaneously in this regard cytokine and chemokine genomic data analysis in blood and at would be an important first step moreover a weighted gene correlation network analysis of sarscov2mediated transcriptional response in infected cells could also be used as a model for human at analysis downstream 39 interesting aspects of transcriptional network analysis could then be tested in appropriate animal models to determine pivotal components of the cytokine storm including key cytokine and chemokine genes that are conserved across species 40 these insights may allow rational diagnostics and therapeutic strategies to be developed in line with this il6 inhibition has already been proposed as a treatment in covid19 and the results of trials of tocilizumab are awaited 41 it would be interesting to examine whether individuals with obesity who are expected to have higher circulating il6 levels compared with lean counterparts respond more favorably to il6 inhibition strategies in covid19 in a post hoc analysis of this randomized controlled trial similarly tissue and systemic analysis of cytokine dynamics may identify likely responders and nonresponders to such therapyin summary we present a rationale for studying the relationship between obesity and covid19 disease severity we provide a theoretical framework whereby viral systemic spread entry and prolonged viral shedding in already inflamed at may augment immune responses with consequences for cytokine cascade amplification we highlight at as an abundant source for local and systemic enrichment of cytokines some already independently associated with increased covid19 mortality finally we suggest a series of research studies to identify whether a mechanistic link exists among at sarscov2 infection organ seeding of infection immune activation and the delayed cytokine storm known to presage rapid clinical decline in highrisk patients with covid19the authors declared no conflict of interest

concern about the role of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids in patients with covid-19 has led to considerable speculation fang et al offered an early commentary on covid-19 that suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers arbs may be associated with worse covid-19 outcomes and added that ibuprofen may be associated with upregulation of the ace2 receptors the presumptive entry point of the sars-cov-2 virus 1 2 further immune suppression may occur with some nsaids 2 such as but not limited to ibuprofen however fang and colleagues subsequently cautioned against overinterpretation of these hypotheses that in some cases led to abrupt changes in drug regimens they state that ace inhibitors and nsaids are important therapeutic drugs and should not be discontinued without careful clinical judgement 2 likewise a website run by prominent international specialists entitled ace2 and hypertension advises individuals taking ace inhibitors or arbs not to change their drug therapy unless a physician advises them to do so 3the speculation about nsaids for patients with covid-19 is twofold first do nsaids increase the likelihood that a person will contract covid-19 and second will a patient with covid-19 taking nsaids have exacerbated symptoms there is no evidence that either of these is the case 4 but there have been observations that worse outcomes in covid-19 may be associated with nsaid use in this connection it must be pointed out that worse outcomes with covid-19 typically occur in older patients and the elderly are more likely than younger patients to take nsaids for chronic pain and are also at elevated risk for covid-19 complications 5 no age-adjusted reports of the association between adverse covid-19 outcomes and nsaid use have been published to the best of the knowledge of the authors thus older age and higher rates of comorbid conditions may be confounding factorsthe purpose of this article is to provide a brief overview of what is currently knownand what is not knownabout the use of nsaids in the setting of covid-19this article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authorssiddiqi and mehra have staged the progression of covid-19 on the basis of 72314 cases observed in china and identified three stages stage i is mild disease and represents the majority of infections stage ii is moderate disease with pulmonary involvement with or without hypoxia and stage iii is severe illness characterized by extrapulmonary hyperinflammation in particular observed by biomarkers such as interleukin il-2 il-6 il-7 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor gcsf macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha mip1 c-reactive protein crp ferritin and high d-dimer scores 6 prior to the outbreak of covid-19 the association of intense cytokine activity with adverse outcomes of influenza had been reported 7 the severity of influenza results from the interplay of viral virulence and host resistance in mild cases of flu the host has a degree of resistance such that the disruptions to homeostasis are quickly resolved and normal balance is restored when that resistance is hyperactive an exaggerated inflammatory response may occur called cytokine stormcytokine storm can cause injury to tissue morbidity and mortality 8 the sars-ncov-2 virus targets epithelial cells of the respiratory system and these progeny viruses can replicate to infect other cells producing an inflammatory response when those cells die either by necrosis or apoptosis 9 high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and crp have been observed in critically ill patients with covid-19 10 cytokine storm has likewise been observed in patients with infectious and rheumatic diseases usually arising from the focal point of the infection and spreading outward through the circulatory system 10 in diseases associated with coronaviruses such as middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers or severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the marked increase in inflammatory cytokines parallels a rapid replication of the virus resulting in lung injury and potentially life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 10 early evaluations of patients with covid-19 suggest similarly high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines along the lines of mers and sars 10 in china one of the diagnostic criteria for covid-19 is lymphocytopenia 10 patients with covid-19 have reduced levels of t cells and natural killer nk cells and some critically ill patients with covid-19 had undetectable levels of nk cells 10 it has been speculated that cytokine storm destroys lymphocytes and destruction of secondary lymphoid tissue has been observed on autopsy of patients with covid-19 10as cytokine storm likely plays a major role in adverse outcomes of severely ill patients with covid-19 the role of anti-inflammatories ranging from nsaids to glucocorticoids to hydroxychloroquine and others would seem beneficial in an effort to reduce inflammation before it overwhelms the bodys systems tocilizumab an il-6 inhibitor has also been discussed in this context along with anakinra an il-1ra to suppress cytokine storm 6 10 tnf blockade via the etanercept receptor downregulates inflammatory response in cytokine storm and etanercept has been proposed as a potential pharmacological strategy in controlling influenza-induced viral pneumonia 11 in a study of mice infected with the influenza ah5n1 virus treating them with celecoxib plus mesalazine plus zanamivir significantly reduced cytokine dysregulation and prevented apoptosis to a greater extent than mesalazine or zanamivir alone 12 that is the addition of celecoxib plus other drugs reduced mortality in these infected mice while such treatment may have value to address the patients hyperinflammatory state it must be recognized that the prognosis for patients with stage iii covid-19 is pooranti-inflammatory therapy for influenza may be associated with certain drawbacks the use of an anti-inflammatory might potentially slow viral elimination and elevate the risk of a secondary infection while an anti-inflammatory can reduce inflammation it may have a limited or poorly understood effect on cytokine storm which involves multiple cytokines and complex interactions in other words an anti-inflammatory agent may affect certain cytokines but not others 10 even if anti-inflammatory therapy were to be advocated it is not yet clear which therapies are best at which point during the disease at what doses and for what durationof course the role of nsaids in viral infections of other kinds has been controversial 13 one argument against the use of nsaids and acetaminophen is that these are antipyretic drugs that may mask a rising fever associated with covid-19 and thus delay diagnosis and rapid management of the infection 14 selective coxibs have been associated with an increased cardiovascular risk but the risk varies with the particular drug 1517 since cox-2 is associated with prostaglandin i2 pgi2 or prostacyclin nsaids that inhibit cox-2 reduce pgi2 but do not inhibit the prothrombotic platelet thromboxane a2 production resulting in a selective reduction in prostacyclin activity that may set the stage for endothelial damage 18 19 nsaids suppress the production of prostaglandins lipids that are associated with fever and pain ibuprofen a widely used nsaid is not strongly selective and blocks both cox-1 and cox-2 13 20 in cases of multiple organ failure which has happened with sars mers and possibly covid-19 the use of nsaids might more easily be associated with gastrointestinal damage if gastrointestinal symptoms occur this should be carefully investigated and treated 21prostaglandin e2 is associated with the classic symptoms of inflammation such as fever redness and localized edema 22 the confusion about nsaids arises mainly because prostaglandin production is complex and can both promote and inhibit inflammatory processes the nsaid indomethacin is known to block the rna synthesis of viruses but this mechanism is independent of cox inhibition and it is not clear if this antiviral activity applies to the sars-ncov-2 virus 22nsaids may be contraindicated in some patients with respiratory disorders nsaids administered to patients with an acute respiratory infection have been implicated in acute myocardial infarction adjusted odds ratio 341 95 confidence interval 2842 but it must be noted that patients with acute respiratory infection have an adjusted odds ratio of 265 95 confidence interval 2331 for acute myocardial infarction even without nsaid use 23 the risk was much higher with parenteral than oral nsaid use adjusted odds ratio 722 95 confidence interval 41128 23 a similar increased risk for stroke was observed in patients suffering acute respiratory infection and taking nsaids in particular by parenteral route nsaids may alter the intrinsic function of neutrophils and in that way change bacterial clearance and delay the resolution of the inflammatory process 24to date there is no strong evidence in favor or disputing the use of nsaids in patients diagnosed with covid-19 4 25 the expert working group of the commission on human medicines in the uk has issued a statement that there is currently insufficient evidence to establish a link between the use of ibuprofen and susceptibility to contracting covid-19 or the worsening of its symptoms 26 indeed any blanket for or against statement on this topic would not be clinically realistic for covid-19 oral nsaids might only be used intermittently over a very short period of time and it is not clear if this would be the same as chronic round-the-clock nsaid therapy or parenteral nsaid administration 25 since nsaids are available over-the-counter accurate records about who has taken them when and in what doses is often sparse and if collected from patient memory would be inherently unreliable furthermore even if evidence emerged favoring or rejecting one particular nsaid in this setting it is not clear whether such evidence would apply to all nsaids in similar fashionas covid-19 ravages the globe clinicians scientists epidemiologists regulators and politicians are eager to offer sane sound advice to keep people safe unfortunately our social-media-driven era of nonstop news is not compatible with the slow and serious work of science clinicians are being confronted with hypotheses speculation anecdotal reports and conjecture on important topics such as the use of nsaids in patients with covid-19 with little strong evidence to guide them first clinicians must consider who is taking the nsaid and why there is no evidence that the occasional use of an oral over-the-counter nsaid for a few days by a person with suspected or diagnosed mild covid-19 infection will exacerbate the infection second there is no reason to think that patients taking prescribed nsaids for a chronic painful condition should stop taking this drug for fear it might increase their risk of contracting covid-19 or exacerbate it if they get it 5 it is likely that many patients with mild cases of covid-19 may take an over-the-counter remedy to help manage symptoms such as muscle aches and fever acetaminophen paracetamol has been proposed as an alternative to nsaid use but there are also issues with acetaminophen toxicity 27to be sure there are covid-19 cases when nsaids should not be used but there is no strong evidence that they must be avoided in all patients with covid-19 clinicians on the frontlines and those advising patients with mild covid-19 cases managed at home should weigh these considerations carefullyalthough the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 continues to spread rapidly around the world research is being actively conducted on the pathogenesis and treatment options for coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 but there are still many unsolved aspects most of the patients infected with sars-cov-2 usually have a mild to moderate illness but depending on the viral load immune system underlying comorbid diseases or currently unknown factors approximately 5 of patients develop the critical disease with respiratory failure and organ dysfunctions 1 pneumonia is the most frequent serious manifestation of infection while acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is the major complication in patients with severe illness other complications include as follows coagulopathy microvascular thrombosis such as myocardial infarction and stroke arrhythmias acute cardiac injury liver injury acute kidney injury and shock 15 in a series of 21 severely ill patients admitted to the icu in the united states ards was observed in most patients and one-third developed cardiomyopathy 4 human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is a functional receptor attacked by sars-cov-2 for cell entry similar to sars-cov 6 ace2 is broadly expressed in the nasal mucosa bronchus lung heart esophagus kidney stomach bladder and ileum and these human organs are all vulnerable to sars-cov-2 especially in severe cases with viremia 7 presumably viral replication of sars-cov-2 in target organs as well as resulting cellular damage causes a systemic inflammatory response cytokine storm mainly ards and multiple organ damage some autopsy studies support these findings in an autopsy study of 21 severe covid-19 patients the primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage with massive capillary congestion accompanied by microthrombi 8 in another postmortem study conducted on 12 patients a high concentration of sars-cov-2 rna was detected in the lung tissue of all the patients and around half of them had high titers of viral rna in the liver kidney or heart in addition to viremia 9according to the third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock sepsis-3 sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection 10 considering the multisystemic clinical and autopsy findings in severe covid-19 patients viral sepsis would be a more accurate term to describe the whole clinical picture fig 1 to put it simply if mild to moderate covid-19 is considered bad infection then severe covid-19 is viral sepsis or bad viral sepsis viral sepsis can be caused by a variety of viruses such as herpes simplex virus influenza enteroviruses human parechoviruses ebola and dengue virus 11 common features of viral sepsis are intense cytokine release prolonged inflammation and consequently immunosuppression t cell exhaustion the development of multiple organ damage and increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections a combination of these concepts has led to a new approach to severe covid-19 patients as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound cellular immunologic and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a higher risk of mortality than with infection alonecurrently the optimal approach to the treatment for covid-19 is uncertain we can classify treatment approaches under three main headings potential anti-infectives supportive treatments for specific target organ systems and immunomodulators fig 2 understanding the mechanism of viral sepsis and associated immunosuppression in covid-19 is vitally important in this way it will be possible to develop effective treatment approaches 12the identification of the toll-like receptors tlrs and the associated concept of innate immunity based upon pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules allowed for significant advances in our understanding of the molecular biology and pathophysiology of sepsis 13 previous studies revealed that lung epithelial cells macrophages and dendritic cells all express cytokines to some extent during influenza infection via the activation of pattern recognition receptors including tlr3 tlr7 and tlr8 a retinoic acid-inducible gene i and the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family members 14 cytokine storm which is a key factor in the rapid progression of covid-19 induces not only inflammation but also apoptosis-related immunosuppression 13 15 16 the primary features of the cytokine storm are fever progressive dyspnea tachypnea elevated interleukin il-6 c-reactive protein ferritin and other inflammatory markers 17 18 the treatment of cytokine storm is of vital importance as it is associated with severe and mortal disease currently there are no specific therapeutic agents for sars-cov-2 and cytokine storm induced by covid-19 however il-6 receptor antibodies as an immunotherapeutic agent have been under compassionate use for cytokine storm treatment in covid-19 patientsil-6 is a multifunctional cytokine produced by different cells such as immune cells mesenchymal cells endothelial cells and fibroblasts in response to infections and tissue damage betacoronavirus infection of monocytes macrophages and dendritic cells results in their activation and the secretion of il-6 and other inflammatory cytokines that result in cytokine release syndrome crs il-6 can signal through different pathways classic signaling trans-signaling and trans-presentation 18 in classical signaling il-6 binds to the membrane-bound il-6 receptor mil-6r found mainly on macrophages neutrophils t cells etc and shows pleiotropic effects on the acquired and innate immune system on the other hand in the trans-signaling pathway il-6 forms a complex with soluble il-6 receptor sil-6r and can activate virtually all cells of the body especially the endothelial cells and develop inflammatory effects 19 both classic- and trans-signals contribute to the development of cytokine storm pulmonary dysfunction and ards crs may also be the contributing factor to t cell exhaustion apoptosis and lymphopenia tocilizumab is a humanized anti-il-6r monoclonal antibody that binds both mil-6r and sil-6r and then inhibits classical and trans-signals a small clinical trial in china examined the effectiveness of tocilizumab in patients who met the criteria for severe covid-19 after a few days of tocilizumab treatment symptoms such as fever pulmonary infiltrates and oxygenation improved and also the lymphocyte counts returned to normal 20 unfortunately despite the use of tocilizumab and antivirals some severe covid-19 patients still have lymphopenia and the prognosis in these patients is poor at this point we need alternative therapeutic agents that will boost the immune system and correct the lymphopenia in severe covid-19 patientscd8 cytotoxic t cells and natural killer nk cells play a critical role in the protection and control of viral infections lymphopenia is commonly seen in patients with severe covid-19 disease and may be a sign of poor prognosis 21 immunopathologically in severe covid-19 patients there is a marked increase in inflammatory cytokines il-2 il-6 combined with lymphopenia 22 there was also an unexpected increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines such as il-10 and il-4 which is an uncommon phenomenon for acute-phase viral infection 17 as the severity of the disease progresses in patients with covid-19 a concomitant rise in inflammatory cytokine levels may lead to the depletion and exhaustion of t cell populations as a result the adaptive immune response cannot be effectively initiated because of the substantial reduction and dysfunction of lymphocytes the uncontrolled virus infection leads to more macrophage infiltration and a further worsening organ injury the degree of lymphopenia has been shown to correlate with the severity of covid-19 and the mortality of septic shock 21 23 a recent study conducted by zheng et al 24 showed that the total number of nk cells and cd8 t lymphocytes had decreased significantly in severe covid-19 patients furthermore it showed that nkg2a expression had significantly increased in immune cells whose functions were suppressed a picture consistent with t cell exhaustion furthermore the number of nk and cd8 t cells had increased in recovering patients while the expression of nkg2a had decreasedsimilarly a previous study has shown that nkg2a receptors on cytotoxic t lymphocytes are over-upregulated during acute polyomavirus infection consequently there was a noticeable decrease in the cytotoxic cellular immune response to prevent viral clearance and viral oncogenesis 25 t cell exhaustion and similar findings were also seen in hiv chronic hepatitis b and hepatitis c infections 26 it is well known that patients with sepsis have an increased checkpoint molecule expressioncytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen-4 ctla-4 and programmed cell death protein 1 pd-1and this condition causes lymphopenia 2729 in another study which involved patients with candida bloodstream infection circulating immune effector cells displayed an immunophenotype consistent with immunosuppression as evidenced by t cell exhaustion and the number of pd-1 positive cd8 t cells that had significantly increased 30 taken together these observations point to a common cascade of events during viral andor bacterial sepsis which leads to increased checkpoint molecule expression and t cell exhaustiondeveloping an efficient immunotherapeutic approach to restoring cell-mediated immunity may play an essential role in overcoming severe covid-19 when we act on the logic of immune checkpoint inhibitors applied in cancer treatments we believe that the inhibition of nkg2a receptors which are upregulated in covid-19 will boost the antiviral activity of cytotoxic t cells and nk cells the immune checkpoint molecules ctla-4 and pd-1 are potent immunomodulators with their inhibitory effects on t cell activation cancer cells and presumably cells infected with viruses produce ligands that stimulate inhibitory checkpoints and inhibit the activity of t cells when these checkpoints are blocked t cells are able to kill cancer cells and virally infected cells more strongly currently many monoclonal antibodies are targeting these immune checkpoints that have been used in cancer treatment 31 immune checkpoint inhibitors may also increase absolute lymphocyte count in cancer patients and this finding is a good prognostic factor and sign of response to treatment 32 in this regard upon extensive literature search monalizumab caught our attention as a novel immune checkpoint inhibitor developed against nkg2a receptors 33 monalizumab is a humanized anti-nkg2a monoclonal antibody that can increase the degranulation of nk cells and hence the production of interferon-gamma that is a vital cytokine for natural and adaptive immunity against viral infections 34we herein propose that a combination of nkg2a inhibitor as an immune system booster with il-6 receptor antibody as an anti-inflammatory agent may be beneficial in severe covid-19 cases inhibition of pd-1 and programmed cell death ligand 1 pd-l1 has been shown to improve pathogen clearance in viral infection models 35 hotchkiss et al 36 hypothesized that by blocking pd-1 or pd-l1 antibody-mediated immunotherapy can reverse t cell depletion-mediated immunosuppression in critically ill patients with sepsis in their clinical evaluation of pd-1pd-l1 pathway inhibition in sepsis monoclonal antibodies against pd-1pd-l1 were well tolerated with no evidence of drug-induced hypercytokinemia or cytokine storm and at higher doses some indication of restored immune statuscurrently there are a few clinical studies registered to clinicaltrialsgov that are aimed at evaluating the efficacy of antibodies against pd-1 receptors in covid-19 we urgently need to consider the use of proven immunomodulatory agents in the treatment of severe covid-19 sepsis until effective vaccines and antiviral drugs are developedsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization on 11th march 2020 and is a major global health concern how to treat patients with covid-19 effectively is a common question for physicians worldwide according to recent statistical data released by the chinese government approximately 19 of cases of covid-19 are severe or criticalhuang et al reported the clinical features and cytokine profile of critically ill patients with covid-19 in wuhan china and suggested that a cytokine storm ie higher concentrations of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor interferon gamma-induced protein 10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 and tumour necrosis factor  could be associated with the severity of disease 1 another study from china reported that increased expression of interleukin il-2r and il-6 in serum appears to predict the severity and prognosis of patients with covid-19 2 additionally pathological examination of a biopsy sample from a patient who died from covid-19 revealed interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in both lungs dominated by lymphocytes 3 furthermore peripheral blood flow cytometric analysis showed that overactivation of t cells accounted in part for the severe immune injury in this patient 3 thus cytokine storms should not be neglected in the treatment of covid-19to date therapeutic options for severe covid-19 remain limited several antiviral drugs such as lopinavirritonavir have shown no benefits compared with standard care 4 a new treatment strategy in addition to antiviral therapy alone is likely to be required to have a significant impact on clinical outcome immunomodulatory therapy to down-regulate the cytokine storm may provide insights into the treatment of covid-19 combined use of an immunomodulatory agent  to reduce the cytokine storm  with an antiviral agent may give physicians more time to provide supportive treatment for patients with covid-19corticosteroids are among the most commonly used drugs for immunomodulatory therapy of infectious diseases however the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of covid-19 can cause host immune suppression and delay viral clearance recent study results have provided information to help handle this dilemma a study at xian jiaotong-liverpool university found that the use of corticosteroids did not influence viral clearance time length of hospital stay or duration of symptoms in patients with mild covid-19 5 this study which included 201 patients with covid-19 found that treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death hazard ratio 038 95 confidence interval 020072 among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards based on these findings the use of corticosteroids is considered beneficial in severe cases of covid-19 especially in partients with ards but not in mild cases 6 according to treatment experiences in china cautious use of corticosteroids is only recommended in certain critically ill patients eg those with hypoxaemia at low-to-moderate doses no more than 12 mgkgday methylprednisolone or equivalent for a short duration 35 days as stated in the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version 7 issued by the national health commission of china 7recently chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine have been used in the treatment of covid-19 in february 2020 results from more than 100 chinese patients with covid-19 showed that chloroquine phosphate had good efficacy 8 french doctors conducted an open-label non-randomized clinical trial and 20 patients with covid-19 who received hydroxychloroquine treatment showed good efficacy 9 both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are weak bases and are able to accumulate in acidic organelles eg lysosomes as such they can increase endosomallysosomal ph and inhibit viral replication 10 in addition to their antimalarial and antiviral effects their anti-inflammatory properties have been demonstrated in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can inhibit major histocompatibility complex class ii expression antigen presentation and immune activation reducing cd154 expression by t cells via toll-like receptor signalling and cgas stimulation of interferon genes 11 thus chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can reduce the production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 interferon- and tumour necrosis factor which are involved in the cytokine storm 11 these immunomodulatory effects synergize their antiviral effects in the treatment of covid-19immunomodulatory agents that directly target the key cytokines involved in covid-19 may also help to alleviate hyperinflammation symptoms in severe cases 12 elevated levels of the inflammatory indicator il-6 in the blood have been reported to be predictive of a fatal outcome in patients with covid-19 13 tocilizumab a specific monoclonal antibody that blocks il-6 has been recommended for use in severe or critically ill patients with extensive lesions in bilateral lungs and a confirmed elevated level of il-6 in the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version 7 issued by the national health commission of china 7 a retrospective analysis on 20 severe cases of covid-10 showed that treatment with tocilizumab led to a reduction in fever and lung lesion opacity and recovered the percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood 14il-6 can bind to transmembrane il-6 receptors mil6r and soluble il-6 receptors sil-6r and the resulting complex can combine with signal transducing component gp130 to activate the inflammatory response tocilizumab can bind specifically to sil-6r and mil-6r and block signal transduction 15 tocilizumab is a good therapeutic option for cytokine release syndrome in chimeric antigen receptor t-cell immunotherapy however clinical experience with tocilizumab in viral disease is very limited in a retrospective study on patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis infected with influenza a reduced fever and a reduced level of c-reactive protein were observed in patients who received tocilizumab compared with patients who did not receive tocilizumab 16 meanwhile il-6 inhibition by tocilizumab did not exacerbate or increase susceptibility to influenza virus infection 16 however there are well documented warnings on increased risk of opportunistic infections including tuberculosis fungal or other viral infections caused by anti-il-6 monoclonal antibodies during the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 17 high costs and safety risks may be a barrier for the wide use of tocilizumab in the treatment of covid-19in early march 2020 chinese clinicians investigated the use of other immunomodulatory agents such as ulinastatin for treatment of the cytokine storm for covid-19 18 ulinastatin is a serine protease inhibitor with anti-inflammatory properties including inhibition of il-6 and it has been used in the treatment of acute pancreatitis and sepsis in japan and china 19 expert consensus from shanghai was that ulinastatin is recommended in patients with exacerbated lung lesions 18 overall certain immunomodulatory agents with good safety profiles may be considered for use in combination with antiviral drugs for the treatment of severe or critical cases of covid-19
table 1
in december 2019 a novel coronavirus disease covid19 caused by infection with sarscov2 has rapidly spread across continents the first report of pathological characteristics of the patient who died from severe infection with sarscov2 showed that an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory cytokines
1
 actually the cytokine storms mediated by overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines have been observed in a large population of critically ill patients infected with covid19
2
 
3
 patients suffered from cytokine storms progress to cardiovascular collapse multiple organ dysfunction and death rapidly therefore early identification treatment and prevention of the cytokine storms are of crucial importance for the patientsil6 is a cytokine that plays an important role in inflammatory reaction and immune response
4
 the most recent clinical experiences in china suggested that il6 is one of the most important cytokines involved in covid19induced cytokine storms for this reason tcz a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin6 receptor il6r is recommended in seriously ill patients with elevated il6 by the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia infected by novel coronavirus issued by the national health commission of china in the latest 7th version however there are limited reallife data about the effect of tcz on the inflammatory activity in covid19 patientsin this retrospective observational study we aimed to present treatment responses of tcz in the covid19 patients and to some extent provide guidance for clinical usethe patients infected with covid19 who were treated with tcz from january 27 to 5 march 2020 at zhongfaxincheng campus of tongji hospital in wuhan china were recruited in this retrospective study all patients were anonymous the study was approved by the ethical committee of huazhong university of science and technologythe data of demographics comorbidities treatments laboratory results and clinical outcomes of the patients were obtained from the medical records based on diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia infected by novel coronavirus issued by the national health commission of china the covid19 was classified into four types mildly ill moderately ill seriously ill and critically ill
5
 the serum levels of crp and il6 were observed before and after tcz administration crp an acutephase reactant reflecting the inflammatory activity was defined as elevated when it was higher than 50 mgl
2
 the level of il6 was defined as elevated when it was higher than 70 pgml
2
 the patients whose laboratory data of crp or il6 is complete deficiency before or after tcz administration were considered as study dropouts the most recent crp or il6 values before tcz administration was selected as the value of before tcz therapy and the changes of the value after tcz administration was observed for a week the clinical outcome of the patients was evaluated within 1 week after tcz therapystatistical analysis was done with spss version 230 data are presented as median minmax or as the number and percentage as appropriate the wilcoxon signedrank test used to compare parameters whenever appropriate a pvalue of less than 05 was considered statistically significantfifteen patients 12 males and 3 females with covid19 were included in this study the characteristics of patients the use of tcz and other antiinflammatory drugs are summarized in table 1 the median age minmax of the patients was 73 6280 years two 133 patients were moderately ill six 400 patients were seriously ill and seven 467 patients were critically ill ten 667 patients had one or more comorbidities including cadiocerebrovascular diseases and endocrine system diseases eight 533 patients received tcz in combination with mp five 333 patients received tcz administration twice or more the dose of tcz used in patients was the range from 80 to 600 mg per timethe laboratory findings of the 15 patients before and in the first week after tcz treatment are summarized in table 2 the crp levels were far above the normal range in all patients before the start of tcz therapy and were rapidly ameliorated after the tcz treatment the value of crp at the first time it was detected after tcz therapy was significantly decreased compared with before tcz therapy which dropped from 1269 1072579 to 112 0021137 mgl p  01 although tcz has benefits in relieving inflammatory activity for the four critically ill patients who received only single dose of tcz therapy three of them no 1 2 and 3 were still dead and the crp level in the rest one patient no 7 failed to return to normal range nearly 20 times higher than normal during the weeklong session in the other 11 patients crp levels were in or near the normal range within 1 weekelevated il6 is the indication for tcz use in covid19 the levels of il6 before tcz administration ranged from 164 to 6271 pgml 2 times to nearly 90 times higher than normal after starting tcz therapy serum il6 level in 10 667 patients tended to spike shortly in first and then decreased one patient no 13 demonstrated a persistent decrease of il6 after tcz administration combined with mp the clinical classification of these patients is mainly moderately ill and seriously ill patients but in these four critically ill patients who failed the treatment no 1 2 3 and 7 a persistent and dramatic increase of il6 was observed except for patients no 1 2 3 and 7 patient no 15 also had a clinical outcome of aggravationin this study we evaluated the effect of tcz therapy in covid19 patients in real life our findings supported the effectiveness of tcz in the prevention or treatment of cytokine storms induced by covid19 in most patients acute phase reactant levels were decreased and the patients were getting to a stable condition reflected by a later gradual decrease of il6 after tcz administrationcorticosteroids such as mp are the conventional agents used to fight cytokine storms however in the treatment of corticosteroids a high dose and a longtime period were often required and follow with subsequent risk of side effects in an attempt to provide a corticosteroidsparing effect tcz was recommended in covid19 patients to prevent or treat cytokine storms the rationale for the use of the antiil6 receptor antibody tcz in covid19 patients is based on our understanding of the role of il6 in this disease and the experience with this drug in the treatment of cytokine release syndrome caused by chimeric antigen receptors redirect t cells
6

the present study suggested that a single dose of tcz seems to fail to improve the disease activity in critically ill patients although it was used in combination with glucocorticoid however repeated doses even repeated with a lower dose of tcz might improve the condition of critically ill patients therefore in addition to the safety advantage a repeated dose of tcz is more likely to be effective than glucocorticoid in the treatment of covid19 moreover single dose of tcz might be expected to benefit these seriously ill patients with about 10 times elevated il6 and the moderately ill patient with an extremely higher level of il6 almost 90 times of normal could also benefit from repetitive tcz therapy nevertheless it seems that repeat the dose at a frequency of daily every other day or every 3 days with a totally two to three doses would be sensible in these critically ill patients or patients with an extremely higher level of il6 considering the long halflife time of tcz and the saturate properties of receptor binding the dose of tcz could be reduced when repeated useil6 can be used to evaluate the severity of the infection and predict the prognosis
7
 dynamic observation of il6 levels is also helpful in understanding the progression of covid19 and the response to treatment il6 level tends to further spiked and then decreased in most patients after starting tcz therapy actually il6 is mainly eliminated via il6rmediated clearance
8
 binding of tcz to il6r inhibits receptormediated clearance of il6 leading to its accumulation in serum this is the likely explanation for the spiked il6 levels in tcztreated covid19 patients in this study and a later gradual decrease of il6 might partly benefit from the inhibition of inflammatory activity by tcz that resulting in stabilization or improvement of clinical outcome given the application of tcz combined with pm in patient 13 we propose that pm might account for the persistent decrease of il6 in this patient since stopping pm administration trend to lead an increase of il6 it is the other possible risk factors not an inflammatory activity which may attribute to the aggravation of the patient no 15our result should be evaluated with caution although we reported a good response in patients with tcz the number of cases reported is still small and using laboratory parameters to define the disease activity is still challenging furthermore the treatment duration observed in our study may not be sufficient to make a final conclusion therefore observation with a sufficient number of covid19 patients is still needed to document the effectiveness of tczthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsjl and dl were responsible for the design of the study and revised the final manuscript pl and yl contributed to the acquisition analysis and interpretation of data pl is responsible for summarizing all data and wrote the draft all data were checked by lq and xlas of 20 april almost 17 million people globally have been diagnosed with corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 a pandemic that has evolved from the emergence of a new coronavirus strain acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in china more than 170000 deaths have been reported while there are certainly many more cases of milder disease that have not been diagnosed and officially confirmed due to limited testing capacity in most countries the pandemic is a global emergency due to the rapid transmission of the disease and the potential to overwhelm the healthcare systems and is expected to have considerable economic and health impacts possible contributing factors their possible role in the relatively high infection death rates between countries and origin have recently been studied 12 this new outbreak has been additionally evaluated for current knowledge on coronaviruses based on a short history to epidemiology pathogenesis clinical manifestation of the disease as well as treatment and prevention strategies 3 the search for potential protective and therapeutic antiviral strategies is of particular and urgent concern 4while in most cases especially in young people without any comorbidities the disease is expected to be relatively mild there is a substantial proportion of patients who develop complications and need intensive care-unit support and mechanical intubation in one case series of 1099 patients in china 5 61  of cases suffered from the primary composite end-point of admission to an intensive care unit the use of mechanical ventilation or death patients with severe disease typically present with dyspnea and hypoxemia shortly after disease initiation and may quickly progress to respiratory failure acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multi-organ failure 6 predictors of adverse outcomes include elevated levels of inflammatory markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines a study of 150 covid-19 cases reported that elevated levels of c-reactive protein crp ferritin and il-6 were associated with death 7 il-6 an important pro-inflammatory cytokine was elevated in fatal cases of covid-19 in another study of 191 patients 8 another study of 452 patients reported that those with severe disease showed lymphocytopenia neutrophilia low levels of monocytes eosinophils and basophils and elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines 9 pathological examination of a case in china revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage desquamation of pneumocytes hyaline membrane formation and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates 10 flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealed reduced levels of cd4 and cd8  t cells which however were hyper-activated and elevated concentration of pro-inflammatory ccr6 th17 in cd4  t cells such findings are hallmarks of ards and resemble features observed in sars and middle eastern respiratory syndrome 1112 systemic vasculitis was also observed 10 therefore it seems that immune dysregulation may be implicated in the pathophysiology of severe covid-19while for decades common thinking suggested that every immune response to antigenic invasion was always beneficial in averting potential damage studies in the 1980s identified that immune cells produce proteins with pleiotropic properties having the potential to be either beneficial or harmful 13 the proteins called cytokines were found to cause clinical manifestations similar to sepsis such as hemodynamic instability fever and localized inflammation 1415 cytokines are important in mediating both immune cell recruitment and complex intracellular signaling control mechanisms that characterize inflammation and infection control they are expressed by numerous cells including macrophages monocytes b cells and t cells promote differentiation of t-helper cells and stimulate cd4 cells 16 while activation of the immune system is important in fighting pathogens dysregulation of cytokine production may lead to uncontrolled effects that can ultimately be detrimental to health 1617cytokine storm also called macrophage activation syndrome is a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by a variety of factors such as infections and drugs 18 it represents a failure of the inflammatory response to return to homeostasis the resulting unregulated immune activity can potentially lead to catastrophic tissue damage the term first appeared in 1993 in an article relevant to graft-versus-host disease 19 subsequently cytokine storm was a phenomenon recognized in both viral and bacterial infections it has been particularly studied in viral infections such as cytomegalovirus pneumonitis influenza virus and sars-cov 20 21 22 23 bermejo-martin et al 21 recruited both inpatients and outpatients during the first wave of the pandemic flu in 2009 nvh1n1 and examined the effects of immune host responses to the evolution of mild or severe disease by measuring serum levels of several chemokines and cytokines they found a dramatic increase of mediators that stimulate th-1 responses and th-17 responses which are responsible for attacking intracellular pathogens and clearing pathogens during host defence reactions among severe hospitalized patients compared to milder cases of nvh1n1 infection during the 2009 pandemic the cytokine storm can result in acute lung injury and further progress to ards this is characterized by local infiltration of inflammatory cells increased vascular permeability and systemic spillover of inflammatory mediators that can cause systemic sepsis-like symptoms 23 while focus on cytokine storm detection relies mostly on measuring cytokines in the systemic circulation it has been suggested that measuring systemic inflammatory mediators may underestimate the extent of the immunological cascade that takes place locally in deep tissues such as the respiratory tract 23 considering the above controlling the inflammatory response may be an effective way of preventing collateral damage caused by the excessive activation of the immune system to clear pathogenssince the early 2000s the cholinergic nervous system has been identified as an important pathway that modifies and controls the inflammatory response surgical dissection of the vagus nerve in mice led to enhanced tnf production and excessive response to endotoxin administration while vagus nerve electrical stimulation inhibits the synthesis of tnf and prevents the acute inflammatory response 24 25 26 several animal experimental models inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as sepsis ischemia-reperfusion and pancreatitis have shown that vagus stimulation improves outcomes this effect is mediated by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nachr 7 subunit on macrophages 27 mice deficient of the 7 subunit exhibited increased endotoxin-induced tnf production and electrical vagus innervation failed to reduce serum tnf levels 27 b-lymphocytes also express 7 nachrs macrophages appear to be very sensitive to acetylcholine which suggests that any source of acetylcholine even from non-neuronal sources such as epithelial and endothelial cells could also modulate the activity of adjacent macrophages 25 besides tnf other pro-inflammatory cytokines are inhibited by acetylcholine such as high mobility group b1 hmgb1 il-1 and il-6 28modulation of inflammatory and immune response by the central nervous system cns through the vagus nerve is based on bi-directional communication between the immune and nervous systems afferent vagus nerve fibers located in nucleus tractus solitarius provide sensory input to the cns about the inflammatory status that can result in the transmission of efferent signals originating from the dorsal motor nucleus to control the inflammatory response 29 such a response is rapid and localized unlike the diffusible anti-inflammatory network which is slow distributed non-integrated and dependent on concentration gradients 25smoking is known to increase the risk for respiratory infection susceptibility and severity 3031 considering that covid-19 was declared by the world health organization as a pandemic a substantial disease burden would be expected among the estimated 11 billion smokers especially in countries with high smoking prevalence therefore there were understandable concerns about this population subgroup 32 additionally smoking-related disease conditions such as cardiovascular disease and copd are also established risk factors for adverse outcomes in covid-19 33 china was the first country to be affected by the pandemic and has a high smoking prevalence in 2018 the population smoking prevalence was 266  with a much higher prevalence in men 505  than in women 21  34 therefore a high smoking prevalence among patients with covid-19 would be expected even if smoking did not adversely affect disease susceptibility and severityon 23 march a preliminary analysis by some members of our group examined data from 5 case series of hospitalized covid-19 patients from china and calculated a smoking prevalence of 102  95  ci 87118  while the estimated expected prevalence was 313  95  ci 87118  35 the analysis was further expanded on 3 april by examining 13 chinese studies and 5960 hospitalized covid-19 patients with a pooled smoking prevalence of 65  95  ci 4982  36 on that date we presented for the first time a hypothesis about the potential beneficial effects of nicotine which was subsequently expanded 37 while there were limitations in the study analysis mainly due to the inability to adjust for confounding factors the findings of low smoking prevalence among hospitalized covid-19 patients in china were consistent across all studies and in agreement with case series from usa 3839 the original hypothesis was based on the anti-inflammatory properties of nicotine through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system acknowledging that the disease appeared to involve a dysregulation of the immune response to viral invasionit is obviously inappropriate to suggest that anyone should initiate smoking or to continue to smoke due to the well-established smoking-related morbidities and the large number of potentially toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke furthermore it is unlikely that any other compound in tobacco cigarette smoke besides nicotine would be implicated to the potential benefits observed in smokers moreover due to the adverse effects of smoking and the fact that many smokers would suffer from co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease copd etc it is expected that the potential benefits of nicotine would be blunted when observed in smokersnicotine is a cholinergic agonist therefore it is an important inhibitor of pro-inflammatory cytokines acting through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway via 7-nachrs nicotine inhibits tnf il-1 il-6 and hmgb1 while it does not inhibit anti-inflammatory cytokines such as il-10 li et al 2011 28 in vivo animal models found nicotine to be protective against lipopolysaccharide-induced ards by reducing leukocyte infiltration and pro-inflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ni et al 2011 mabley et al 2011 such effects are relevant to covid-19 since cytokine storm appears to be the hallmark in severe cases 4041 several pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-2 il-6 il-17 il-8 tnf and ccl2 are elevated in covid-19 patients 42 treatment with anti-il-6 anti-tnf medications has been proposed and clinical trials are already underway 4344 however it may be more effective to inhibit several instead of selectively one cytokine while some cytokine inhibitors are associated with elevated risk of opportunistic infections 45 also it is possible that measuring blood levels of inflammatory cytokines does not accurately reflect the extent of the immune imbalance that exists locally in the lungs in any case the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system provides better control and modulation of the cytokine response compared to blocking a single agent and nicotine could effectively contribute to maintaining a balanced immune response against viral infection therefore it is possible that the clinical manifestations of cytokine storm in covid-19 patients are the result of dysfunction of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathwaysars-cov-2 is known to use the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a receptor for cell entry 46 ace2 has well-established vasodilatory anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties studies on smoking and ace2 are contradictory studies published before the covid-19 pandemic reported that smoking and nicotine down-regulate ace2 4748 however more recent studies suggest that they up-regulate ace2 49 50 51 there is currently no evidence to suggest that up-regulation of ace2 is associated with increased covid-19 susceptibility or severity in fact up-regulation of ace2 appears to be protective against tissue damage caused by sars-cov-2 ace2 has been found to protect mice from developing ards 52 53 54 data from sars experimental studies suggest that continuous sars-cov-2 infection and replication induces immediate down-regulation of ace2 that may be implicated in organ damage and disease severity 55 further support for the beneficial role of ace2 comes from data that estrogens appear to up-regulate ace2 while children and younger adults have higher ace2 levels compared to older people 5657 at the same time women children and young people have milder covid-19 symptoms if accurate and verified the recently-observed ace2 up-regulation in smokers is probably induced as a defence mechanism to counteract the effects of angiotensin ii there is probably a dynamic balance between ace and ace2 which is continuously changing depending on stressors and stimuli thus there is uncertainty on whether nicotine affects covid-19 progression through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and there is no known interaction between ace2 and nachr receptorsimportantly ace2 is expressed in several regions in the brain the regions where vagal afferent fibers terminate and vagal efferent fibers originate exhibit ace2 expression 5859 neuroinvasion is a common feature of coronaviruses 60 anosmia and ageusia have been reported by covid-19 patients 61 sars-cov-2 may enter the cns either through the blood stream or via the olfactory nerve across the cribriform plate 6263 a case series of 214 patients reported that 364  had neurological manifestations 64 thus it is possible that the virus might infect the terminal areas of vagus afferent fibers or the origin of vagus efferent fiber causing down-regulation of ace2 and resulting in local inflammation that could disrupt the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and dysregulate the inflammatory response nicotine could have protective properties against possible brain inflammation caused by sars-cov-2 mediated through 7-achrs 65a noteworthy parameter relative to anosmia and ageusia observed among covid-19 patients is that these are characteristic and prodromal non-motor manifestations of parkinsons disease 6667 while ageusia has not been extensively studied olfactory disturbance is a very common feature observed in up to 95  of parkinsons disease patients 67 and this symptom may appear several years before the onset of motor symptoms there is no olfactory improvement with dopamine agonists 6869 unlike the general population where smoking is associated with impaired olfactory function smokers with parkinsons disease experience less decline in olfactory sense compared to non-smokers suggesting a protective effect of smoking sharer et al 2015 this is explained by the fact the phenomenon has been linked to impairment of cholinergic transmission 70 while nicotine improved the olfactory impairment in a mouse model of parkinsons disease 71 the olfactory bulb has a rich network of nachrs but 7 nachrs may also be expressed on the axon terminals of the olfactory receptor neurons 72 while this may suggest facilitated brain infection through anterograde transport along the olfactory nerve it is possible that olfactory receptor neurons may act as first-line viral sensors and initiate a rapid immune response 73 this would explain the mild symptoms in covid-19 patients with olfactory lossin any case anosmia may represent another sign of dysfunction of the nicotinic cholinergic system in covid-19a prominent feature of covid-19 is coagulopathy that results in thromboembolic complications venous thromboembolism was reported in 25  of patients who were not under thromboprophylaxis and was associated with higher mortality rate 74 abnormal coagulation parameters were also associated with poor survival 75 although venous thromboembolism is a well-known risk factor of any serious infection additional mechanisms such as endothelial damage increased vascular permeability and microvascular occlusion may be implicated in covid-19 76 it is important to note that platelets express functional 7-achrs 77 while hematopoietic 7 nachr deficiency increases inflammation and platelet activity 78 recently acetylcholine was found to be an endogenous inhibitor of platelet activation 79 therefore dysfunction of the nicotinic cholinergic system could be implicated in the thrombotic and vascular complications of covid-19the observation of a low prevalence of hospitalized covid-19 patients in china led to the development of a hypothesis that nicotine could have protective effects by enhancing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway 36 as more studies presented the clinical manifestations laboratory findings and disease progression in covid-19 patients it became apparent that the nicotinic cholinergic system could explain most if not all of the disease characteristics it would be unlikely for a single defence system to ameliorate all the diverse and complex manifestations of covid-19 unless that defence mechanism was the target of the viral host could that be possiblesars-cov-2 appears to have originated from a bat coronavirus ji et al 80 carried out comprehensive sequence analysis in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage bias and reported that the virus may have been a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an unknown-origin coronavirus 80 one possible intermediate host could have been a snake coronavirus taking into consideration that snake venom toxins are competitive antagonists of acetylcholine on 7-nach receptor with high affinity we decided to explore the hypothesis that sars-cov-2 may have acquired sequences by any of the potential and not defined yet intermediates through genomic recombination we compared the protein sequences between sars-cov-2 and snake venom neurotoxins we were able to identify regions with four or five amino acids homology between the coronavirus and several neurotoxin molecules eg sars-cov-2 compared with alpha bungarotoxin fig 1
a sars-cov-2 and alpha-cobratoxin fig 1btherefore we hypothesize that these sequences on the sars-cov-2 proteins being similar to the active sites of a neurotoxin can result in binding to nachrs and adversely affecting their function by preventing the action of acetylcholinenicotine could act as a competitive agonist for the nachrs that could restore the compromised function of the nicotinic cholinergic system this may be feasible through repurposing already approved for other indications pharmaceutical nicotine products such as nicotine patches for use by non-smokers or even by using these products as already indicated ie as smoking substitutes among current smokers these products are available over-the-counter in most countries they have been administered therapeutically in non-smokers for neurological conditions and inflammatory bowel disease for larger periods than would be needed for covid-19 81 82 83 no abuse liability was observed in non-smokers despite being administerd for several weeks 8283 besides gums and patches nicotine can be administered though inhalation with the use of a nebulizer or other aerosol systems if necessary nicotine administration could be added on top of antiviral or other therapeutic options for covid-19 by restoring and re-activating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway a more universal suppression of the cytokine storm could probably be achieved compared to administering inhibitors of a single cytokine the potential need to provide pharmaceutical nicotine products to smokers and users of other nicotine products who experience abrupt withdrawal symptoms of nicotine when hospitalized for covid-19 or aim to follow medical advice to quit smoking should also be examined additionally if the hypothesis about the beneficial effects of nicotine is valid smokers who quit nicotine use when hospitalized will be deprived from these benefits in france the addiction prevention network respadd officially recommends the use of nicotine replacement therapies for smokers when hospitalized for any illness 84 clinical trials will dictate future approaches and the role of nicotine in covid-19 while further experimental studies should examine the affinity of the virus to nachrsin conclusion we noticed that most of the clinical characteristics of severe covid-19 could be explained by dysregulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system the observation that patients eventually develop cytokine storm which results in rapid clinical deterioration led to the development of a hypothesis about the series of events associated with adverse outcomes in covid-19 fig 2
once someone is infected with sars-cov-2 the immune system is mobilized as the virus replicates cell and viral debris or virions may interact with the nachrs blocking the action of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway if the initial immune response is not enough to combat the viral invasion at an early stage the extensive and prolonged replication of the virus will eventually block a large part the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway seriously compromising its ability to control and regulate the immune response the uncontrolled action of pro-inflammatory cytokines will result in the development of cytokine storm with acute lung injury leading to ards coagulation disturbances and multiorgan failure based on this hypothesis covid-19 appears to eventually become a disease of the nicotinic cholinergic system nicotine could maintain or restore the function of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system and thus control the release and activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines this could prevent or suppress the cytokine storm this hypothesis needs to be examined in the laboratory and the clinical settingnot applicablenot applicableno funding was provided for this study85 86

progression by interfering with innate antiviral immunity development of secondary infections and adverse drug effects 21 22 23 24 given the high mortality rates observed in severe covid-19 clinicians have used off-label tocilizumab and other immunomodulatory agents in practice in select cases 25 26 27 28 29literature to date on tocilizumab in covid-19 has described outcomes at 14 days predominately in those with less severe disease and with limited descriptions of adverse effects the factors associated with a beneficial response from tocilizumab are unknown we report the clinical characteristics associated with in-hospital survival at 28 days in patients with covid-19 receiving off-label tocilizumabthis was a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to a five-hospital health system in southeast and south-central michigan the study was approved by henry ford health systems institutional review board irb 13809 with waiver of consentpatients hospitalized from march 1 2020 through april 3 2020 were eligible for inclusion if they were 18 years of age or older had confirmed covid-19 infection and received tocilizumab patients were excluded if they were transferred from an out-of-system hospital had a positive microbiologic culture 24 h prior to or 48 h after tocilizumab administration that was treated with an antimicrobial were pregnant or incarcerated a confirmed case of covid-19 was defined as a patient with positive reverse-transcriptasepolymerase-chain-reaction rt-pcr assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 in a nasopharyngeal sample tested by the michigan department of health and human services or the health systems centralized clinical microbiology laboratorypatients were risk stratified by symptoms prior to tocilizumab administration as mild moderate or severe covid-19 patients without hypoxia or exertional dyspnea were considered to have mild covid-19 patients who presented with infiltrates on chest radiography and required supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or high-flow nasal cannula hfnc were classified as having moderate covid-19 patients who had respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were classified as having severe covid-19 30 all patients were followed for up to 28 days from the first dose of tocilizumab patient data was censored on april 30 2020hospitalized patients with covid-19 received supportive care comprised of supplemental oxygen hfnc invasive mechanical ventilation antibiotics vasopressors and renal-replacement therapy as determined by the primary team patients who progressed to ards were managed with lung protective ventilation strategies 19 an institutional treatment covid-19 guideline was developed that included lopinavir-ritonavir with ribavirin or hydroxychloroquine monotherapy based on disease severity intravenous iv remdesivir was available for compassionate use or within a clinical trial the institutional guidelines were developed by consensus and based on the available literature experience from wuhan china and other centers around the world affected by covid-19 before michigan on march 17 2020 lopinavir-ritonavir with ribavirin was removed 9 a short course of corticosteroids was added to the institutional guideline for patients with moderate to severe covid-19 on march 20 2020 1930 tocilizumab was used on a case-by-case basis for patients exhibiting symptoms of cytokine storm as described below when assessed by the primary and infectious disease physicianpatients were eligible for tocilizumab if exhibiting persistent fevers 380 c for greater than 6 h had a partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio less than 200 and exhibited persistently rising

twenty-nine 358 patients experienced hypertriglyceridemia with levels greater than 500 mgdl of the patients that developed hypertriglyceridemia eight did not receive propofol all patients with elevated amylase and lipase levels received concurrent propofol a total of 18 222 patients developed an infection the median time to development of infection from tocilizumab was 9 613 days no difference was observed in the median time to development of infection between survivors and non-survivors there was a total of seventeen 210 bacterial infections and three 37 fungal infections no differences were noted in the occurrence of adverse effects between survivors and non-survivors supplemental table 2in this retrospective cohort study the clinical characteristics factors independently associated with survival and 28 day outcomes in patients with covid-19 after tocilizumab administration were described receipt of tocilizumab within 12 days of symptom onset in patients with covid-19 was the only factor independently associated with in-hospital survival at 28 days a clinical response was more likely to occur in those that survived the association with improved survival remained intact when adjusting for sofa score and male sex covid-19 progression has been characterized by a biphasic response with the latter phase consisting of an excessive hyper-inflammatory response 16 early intervention to mitigate the cytokine storm with an immunomodulator may optimize patient outcomes this study further supports that intervention timing relative to disease onset is a key factor 27the study population had a high likelihood for severe covid-19 and mortality based on presenting call and sofa scores 3135 high rates of obesity hypertension and diabetes were observed in the present study relative to previous epidemiologic reports of covid-19 57 rates of mechanical ventilation and mortality were higher compared to previous reports of tocilizumab use in covid-19 reasons for this difference in mortality may be explained by a difference in severity of illness high rates of co-morbidities associated with severe covid-19 a longer duration of follow-up a higher rate of invasive mechanical ventilation and rates of ards 25 26 27 28 mortality rates observed in the present study are similar to those reported for critically ill covid-19 populations and the general icu population with ards 73637a sofa score of 8 on day 0 was independently associated with mortality a sofa score of 3 on hospital presentation has been described as an independent predictor for mortality in the covid-19 population 35 an improvement was noted in survivors for sofa scores and six-category scale ards severity was also improved in survivors a finding consistent with other immunomodulatory trials 29 these findings are important to guide the use of off-label tocilizumab in those with cytokine storm associated with covid-19 until results of randomized controlled trials are availableno standard definition for cytokine storm related to covid-19 exists previous studies have defined cytokine storm associated with covid-19 using various threshold values for vital signs crp il-6 ferritin and ldh 25 26 2729 crp is the only common diagnostic marker amongst all published reports to date with values of 510 mgdl 1020 times the upper limits of normal being used to define cytokine storm following tocilizumab administration in the present study crp was reduced in all patients as seen in previous reports of tocilizumab and an il-1 receptor antagonist anakinra 25 26 27 28 29 the astct grading for crs identified 852 of patients with cytokine storm but this may be an imperfect diagnostic tool in the setting of covid-19 future research is needed to establish criteria to define cytokine storm associated with covid-19 and identify progression of disease from the viral phase to the hyper-inflammatory phase 16 recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of antivirals in limiting disease severity 1012 a step-wise treatment approach using antiviral and immunomodulatory agents in succession for patients with disease progression appears to be a viable therapeutic approach that may warrant researchhypertriglyceridemia occurred frequently in the present cohort irrespective of propofol use clinicians should routinely monitor triglyceride levels markers for pancreatitis and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh if tocilizumab is administered due to the inflammatory markers associated with shlh an il-6 antagonist may not prevent this complication and continuous monitoring is paramount 23 secondary infections were noted in 222 of patients which is higher than a previous report of 16 however rates in epidemiologic reports of critically ill covid-19 populations describe a range of 47325 1028353839 if unable to enroll patients into a clinical trial clinicians should consider a multidisciplinary approach to weigh the benefits and potential risks of off-label tocilizumab for covid-19this study has several limitations the study population included is predominately one that is critically ill with severe covid-19 and results may not be applicable to less severe populations this study was conducted within a single health system with a limited sample size and with no placebo comparator group the study follow-up period was 28 days after tocilizumab administration which limits the assessment of long term efficacy and adverse effects however the follow-up is longer than what has been reported for tocilizumab and is consistent with duration of follow-up for antiviral agents 910 the health systems covid-19 guideline were modified during the study period but the treatments received in both survivors and non-survivors was consistentthe receipt of tocilizumab within 12 days of symptom onset may be a key factor independently associated with 28-day survival in covid-19 research is needed to define diagnostic criteria for cytokine storm associated with covid-19 establish the clinical efficacy of tocilizumab in placebo-controlled trials and further describe which covid-19 populations may derive clinical benefit from tocilizumabthis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectors

based on our current pathophysiological understanding sars-cov-2 replicates in respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells and suppresses early type i interferon responses furthermore sars-cov-2 can abortively infect innate immune cells monocytes and macrophages which can be facilitated by immune complexes accelerating viral replication and amplifying proinflammatory cytokine il-1 il-6 tumour necrosis factor tnf release in a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement viral replication results in tissue damage and excessive recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells which mediates a dysregulated hyperinflammatory response that contributes to cytokine storm syndrome and organ damage including ards6 in addition to the direct cytopathic effect inflicted on target organs pulmonary damage seen in covid-19 is probably augmented if not dominated by an unopposed dysregulated immune response ards can occur in patients with primary or secondary cytokine storm syndrome including systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis resembling the clinical picture in the reported patient this finding could account for the rapid onset of clinical and imaging findings7 since the patient showed altered clotting prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time and increased d-dimer in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and pathologically reduced serum complement levels immune complex generation and deposition could in addition to endothelial activation through il-1 have contributed to activation of the complement and clotting cascades8 indeed postinfectious antiphospholipid syndrome with thromboembolism has been reported in the context of covid-199 furthermore complement activation can take place in systemic inflammatory disorders such as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated macrophage activation syndrome10
off-label treatment with anakinra was chosen to limit proinflammatory cytokine expression which could have been triggered by antibody-dependent enhancement or invasion of yet uninfected immune cells to infected tissues of note anakinra blocks il-1 receptor signalling which induces the expression of il-1 il-6 and tnf via activation of nf-b-dependent pathways11 although most clinical trials currently underway investigate il-6 blockade we chose anakinra based on its action upstream of il-6 and because of less neutropenia liver enzyme elevation and hypertriglyceridemia which are already present in patients with cytokine storm syndrome furthermore anakinra reduces mortality in sepsis patients12 whereas chronic use of il-6 blocking agents might increase the risk of secondary infections anakinra treatment coincided with clinical improvement and was stopped after 6 daysduring the ongoing pandemic covid-19 must be considered in patients with increased inflammatory variables and abdominal symptoms the onset of cytokine storm syndrome and ards can be rapid and life-threatening based on the time of testing the site of infection or both pcr testing might remain negative anakinra is safe and effective in other inflammatory and autoinflammatory disorders and it could be beneficial in covid-19-associated cytokine storm syndrome in which disordered host responses contribute to pathology inflammatory endothelial activation antiphospholipid antibodies and complement activation all promote a proinflammatory and coagulopathic state antithrombotic prophylaxis should be considered particularly in the presence of coronary artery dilation or aneurysm prospective controlled trials are necessary to generate evidence for stage-specific and individualised treatment options in covid-19every minute an american dies of covid-19 cytokine storm multiorgan failure and particularly acute respiratory distress syndrome ards are the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in patients with covid-19 a fulminant ards kills the majority of covid-19 victims 1 also there are whispers that some of the survivors might develop pulmonary sequels further investigations and follow-ups are warranted in this case 2 3 a large number of suggested treatments such as ivermectin hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are currently under investigation among them hydroxychloroquine azithromycin and recently remdesivir showed acceptable results in clinical trials as of june 2020 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 nevertheless the results of these interventions are not completely satisfactory and studies for other medications are still warranted fig 1
pirfenidone 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-1h-pyridone is a novel anti-fibrotic agent with trivial adverse effects 11 12 13 pirfenidone is approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf in humans for patients with mild to moderate disease 14 15
diverse action mechanisms have been suggested for pirfenidone among them are downregulating effects on a series of cytokines including transforming growth factor tgf- 1 connective tissue growth factor ctgf platelet-derived growth factors pdgf and tumor necrosis factor tnf-  16 17 18 19 20 additionally pirfenidone is a reactive oxygen species ros scavenger and last but not the list pirfenidone downregulates the expression of ace receptor the major cellular receptor for covid-19 21 22 23 additioally some other characteristics of pirfenidone makes it an appropriate treatment for covid-19 among them are anti-apoptotic and anti-fibrotic effects of pirfenidone the details of the hypothesis have been discussed below based on known pirfenidone mechanism of action and the pathophysiology of covid-19 i believe that pirfenidone has the potential for the treatment of covid-19 patientsthe anti-inflammatory effects of pirfenidone have been shown in several experimental studies it has been shown that pirfenidone inhibits tnf- secretion and decrease a large number of other inflammatory cytokines as well 20 32 33 34 additionally li et al in a recent study shown that pirfenidone ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis by blocking nlrp3 inflammasome activation 35 36
it has been shown in several studies that pirfenidone significantly inhibits tgf-  1-induced fibronectin synthesis 17 18 down-regulating of profibrotic gene expression and collagen secretion has been shown in humans and animal models treated with pirfenidone 37 38 39 reduction of overexpression of tgf-  in inflammatory conditions plays a key role in the antifibrotic activity of pirfenidone 38 40
pirfenidone inhibits collagen i fibril formation and causes a reduction in collagen fibril bundles 39 41 42 it has been shown that pirfenidone has pleiotropic actions on both the immune system and extracellular matrix ecm such as hyaluronan a major component of the ecm that regulates tissue injury and repair 43 recently the upregulation of rgs2 has been suggested as a novel mechanism of amelioration of pulmonary fibrosis with pirfenidone treatment 44
the followings are probable endpoints of an overactive inflammatory response and wbc free radical formation in microsome via microsomal nadph cytochrome c reductase and mitochondria nadh-quinone oxidoreductase of the innerouter membranes excitotoxicity damage to lipids and proteins apoptosis adp-ribosylation injury to mitochondrial dna and impaired no activity 11 22 45 cytoskeletal damage and lipid peroxidation are the other destructive effects of inflammation and severe oxidative stress due to cytokine storm 23 45 46 hence the antioxidant character of pirfenidone makes it potent for the treatment of hyperimmune response 11 22 23 30 31
lipid peroxidation which is initiated by generated superoxide in the cyclic reduction-oxidation is one of the mechanisms of cytokine storm-inflammation-oxidative stress end-organ-damage and pulmonary toxicity 11 it has been shown that pirfenidone could inhibit nadph dependent lipid peroxidation 22 45
it has been shown that fas-dependent alveolar apoptosis that results in inflammatory reaction and finally interstitial fibrosis is responsible for the battle against viruses and also responsible for sequels of infections such as poxvirus bacterial lps etc35 47 on the other hand it has been shown that pirfenidone could decrease apoptosis19 48 49 50 51
ace receptors are the major covid-19-sars virus receptor in humans trials that targeted the inhibition of these receptors with antibodies are under investigation 52 surprisingly it has been shown that pirfenidone inhibits the at1rp38 mapk pathway decreased angiotensin-converting enzyme ace angiotensin ii and angiotensin ii type 1 receptor expression and strongly enhanced liver x receptor- expression 21 this will not only protect cells from developing fibrosis lxr- also by decreasing the ace receptor expression decrease entrance of the covid-19-sars virus into cellswith respect to the known characteristics of pirfenidone anti-inflammatory anti-fibrotic antioxidant and our current understanding of severe covid-19 pathophysiology cytokine storm inflammation probable fibrosis hyper-immunity and as a result oxidative stress it is rational to suggest pirfenidone application in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe covid-19-sarsuncontrolled overreaction of the immune system to the virus leads to the release of numerous inflammatory cytokines further superoxide production ards development and subsequently matrix remodeling and overproduction of collagen and other matrix components that may cause fibrosis in survivors 25 53 54 cytokine storm an uncontrolled immune reaction is responsible for the development of multi-organ damage and ards in patients with covid-19-sars 53
anti-inflammatory effects of pirfenidone have been shown in several animal studies and clinical trials the antioxidant activity of pirfenidone has been verified in several experimental studies 20 24 25 54 32 33 34 furthermore the anti-fibrotic effects of pirfenidone have been shown in several clinical trials and tend to fda approval of this drug for the treatment of patients with ipf 14 22 55 56 57 58
based on pirfenidone characteristics and therapeutic effects i have previously suggested the treatment of paraquat with pirfenidone which is gradually opened its space in the treatment protocols of patients with paraquat poisoning 11 59 60 61 62 previously saha et al successfully treated the patients with post h1n1 ards pulmonary fibrosis with combined pirfenidone azithromycin and prednisolone 63 to the best of my knowledge the mechanisms of post h1n1 ards fibrosis and paraquat poisoning and covid-19 share similarities additionally pirfenidone successfully improved treatment of post-h1n1 ards fibrosis hence it seems equitable to evaluate the potential of pirfenidone in the treatment of covid-19 63 also pirfenidone has been suggested and tried successfully in the treatment of ards due to white smoke-induced ards 11 as another example zinc chloride smoke white smoke inhalation induced severe ards has been successfully treated with a combination of pirfenidone and corticosteroids 35 64
pirfenidone has been approved by the fda for the treatment of patients with ipf it has been tolerated very well with trivial side effects 15 65 66
the current situation enforced clinicians and agencies to relax strict preclinical approval and extensive experimentation before starting human experimental treatment and clinical trials the fact that our hands are empty in the battle against covid-19 and an urgent need for treatment enforced us to try any possible probably safe treatment and those approved medications with low side effects are among the suggested and tried medications actually our current standard of care knowledge is based on these experimentsnevertheless a limited number of labs have access to animal models of covid-19-sars and can conduct experimental studies parallel or before human trials we have no time to wait for animal modeling and animal models do not necessarily provide valid shreds of evidence in this case in terms of toxicity or efficacy of treatments because mortality of this virus is almost always due to interaction of the virus with human immune system and animals are not appropriate surrogate models here 67
at the end of the day only a well-designed double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial is the best method to appropriately analyze this hypothesisin a limited number of patients covid-19 present as a fulminant cytokine storm ards and end-organ damage but the death toll of this limited number of patients surpassed a one and a half million recently this is a human tragedy that calls for immediate interventionnew therapeutic strategies are considered in the treatment of covid-19 however to the best of my knowledge pirfenidone has not been tried yet as discussed above i believe that pirfenidone could be a safe add on to the current protocols of covid-19 treatment with trivial side effects and plenty of potential benefitsduring the reviewing process of this article some other studies proposed similar point of view68 69 70 for example parallel to what i discussed here george et all also pointed to the shared risk factors of covid-19 and ipf and mentioned that the burden of lung fibrosis following covid-19 is likely to be high they concluded that given the scale of the pandemic the global burden of fibrotic lung disease will probably increase considerablythey also suggested a therapeutic rationale for application of approved antifibrotic therapy in acute exacerbations of ipf pirfenidone and nintedanib are among themin conclusion pirfenidone could inhibit apoptosis downregulate ace receptors expression decrease inflammation by several mechanisms and ameliorate oxidative stress and hence protect pneumocytes and other cells from covid-19 invasion and cytokine storm simultaneously figure onethe outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 firstly found in wuhan in the

effort demonstrated by more than 600 clinical trials currently underway typing sars-cov-2 on clinicaltrialsgov no vaccines or effective drugs have been approved to prevent or treat covid-19 and the current standard care is supportive treatment therefore based on the fast and global spread of the virus urgent investigations are warranted in order to develop effective therapies within this context treatments addressing the immunopathology of the infection have become a major focusthe new human-infecting sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna-enveloped virus belonging to cov family1 among the six covs pathogenic to humans four of them have been associated with mild respiratory symptoms2 while two of them sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers cov mers-cov whose epidemic outbreaks took place in 2002 and 2012 respectively caused severe respiratory diseases in affected individuals2 sars-cov-2 is the seventh identified cov and after sars-cov and mers-cov the third zoonotic virus of covs that has been transmitted from animals to humans via an intermediate mammalian host34 in particular based on genetic analysis chinese horseshoe bats have been proposed to serve as natural reservoir hosts for sars-cov-2 similar to sars-cov and mers-cov46 moreover genomic analysis indicates that sars-cov-2 is in the same beta-cov clade as sars-cov and mers-cov1 in particular sars-cov-2 has been observed to share almost 80 of the genome with sars-cov167 and almost all encoded proteins of sars-cov-2 are homologous to sars-cov proteins1 in contrast sars-cov-2 has been found to be more distant from mers-cov with only 50 identity1 moreover the entry of sars-cov-2 into human host cells has been found to rely on the same receptor as sars-cov the surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is expressed in the type ii surfactant-secreting alveolar cells of the lungs89 consistently despite amino acid variations at specific key residues homology modeling revealed a structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of sars-cov and sars-cov-21 however further studies are necessary to compare sars-cov and sars-cov-2 affinities to ace2 receptor that might explain the increased transmissibility and greater virulence of sars-cov-2 compared with sars-cov8two independent groups provided key insights into the first step of sars-cov2 infection by demonstrating that ace2 host receptor is required for host cell entry of sars-cov-2810 noteworthy the expression of ace2 receptors is not only restricted to the lung and extrapulmonary spread of sars-cov in ace-expressing tissues has been demonstrated1113 hence the same pattern may be expected for sars-cov-2 with most of human tissues such as oral mucosa and gastrointestinal tract kidney heart blood vessels expressing ace2 receptors particularly prone to sars-cov-2 infection1415 the viral entry of sars-cov-2 has been further found to be prevented by a clinically proven inhibitor of the cellular host type 2 transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 camostat mesylate8 priming of the envelope-located trimeric spike s protein by host proteases which cleave at the s1s2 and the s2 sites has been described as a fundamental step for viral entry and the host protease tmprss2 emerged as a key cellular factor necessary for the priming of s protein and for the consequent membrane fusion and viral internalization by endocytosis in the pulmonary epithelium8 hence tmprss2 has been proposed as a potential target for clinical intervention68 and its inhibitor camostat mesylate approved for human use in japan to treat pancreatic inflammation has attracted the attention of the scientific community currently a randomized placebo-controlled phase iia trial is investigating the use of camostat mesylate nct04321096 and is expected to run until december 2020 whereas another independent trial will start in june 2020 to evaluate the efficacy of camostat mesilate in combination with hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients with moderate covid-19 infection nct04338906a detailed analysis of additional mechanisms of cellular viral infection for sars-cov-2 is still missing and would be fundamental to identify further potential biological substrates to targetseveral studies highlight relevant changes occurring both in innate and adaptive immune system in covid-19 patients in particular lymphocytopenia and a modulation in total neutrophils are common hallmarks and seem to be directly correlated with disease severity and death618 in patients with severe covid-19 a marked decrease in the levels of absolute number of circulating cd4 cells cd8 cells b cells and natural killers nk cells161719 as well as a decrease in monocytes eosinophils and basophils has been reported1921 in addition most of patients with severe covid-19 displayed significantly increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines eg il-6 il-1 il-2 il-8 il-17 g-csf gm-csf ip-10 mcp-1 ccl3 and tnf2022 although no direct evidence for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines involvement in lung pathology in covid-19 has been reported an increase in serum cytokine and chemokine levels as well as in neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio nlr in sars-cov-2 infected patients has been correlated with the severity of the disease and adverse outcomes suggesting a possible role for hyper-inflammatory responses in covid-19 pathogenesis20 moreover a recent multicenter retrospective cohort study analyzing data from the early risk stratification of novel coronavirus pneumonia ers-covid-19 study chictr2000030494 showed that patients with covid-19 had elevated high-sensitivity c-reactive protein hs-crp and procalcitonin serum levels two major inflammation markers associated with high risks of mortality and organ injury23noteworthy mers-cov has been demonstrated to infect thp-1 cells human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells and sars-cov to directly infect macrophages and t cells24 thereby inducing delayed but elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines2526 however ace2 receptor is only minimally expressed in monocytes macrophages and t cells in the lung hence the mechanism by which sars-cov directly infects immune cells is still unknown27 taking into account the similarities between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 it is likely that also this latter may infect monocytes and macrophages by a mechanism that has to be still unveiled in this regard it is possible that the virus may be capable to bind other specific receptors andor other mechanisms of viral entry mode can be exploited by the virusas far as concerns the adaptive immunity the novel sars-cov-2 has been demonstrated to mainly affect lymphocyte counting and balance in particular li et al reported that compared with survivors dead covid-19 patients showed lower percentage and count in cd3 cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes populations strong predictive values for in-hospital mortality organ injury and severe pneumonia23in a retrospective single-center study enrolling a cohort of 452 patients with covid-19 in wuhan patients with severe covid-19 displayed a significantly lower number of total t cells both helper t cells and suppressor t cells20 in particular among helper t cells a decrease in regulatory t cells with a more pronounced reduction according to the severity of the cases and in memory t cells has been observed whereas the percentage of nave t cells was found increased20 notably nave and memory t cells are essential immune components whose balance is crucial for maintaining a highly efficient defensive response nave t cells enable the defenses against new and previously unrecognized infection by a massive and tightly coordinated release of cytokines whereas memory t cells mediate antigen-specific immune response a dysregulation in their balance favoring nave t cells activity compared with regulatory t cells could highly contribute to hyperinflammation a reduction in memory t cells on the other hand could be implicated in covid-19 relapse since a number of recurrences has been reported in recovered cases of covid-19628 these data are consistent with results reported by tan et al29 overall the lymphopenia observed in covid-19 patients may depend on the fact that sars-cov-2 may directly infect lymphocytes minimally expressing ace2 leading to lymphocyte death or alternatively may directly damage lymphatic organs since they express ace2 receptors29 however to date no data are available on lymph nodes and spleen shrinking and lymphocytes functionalities hence such speculations need to be further investigated to confirm these hypothesesas far as concerns b cells by using single-cell rna sequencing to characterize the transcriptome landscape of blood immune cell subsets during the recovery stage of covid-19 wen et al30 found significant changes in b cells in particular while the nave b cells have been reported to be decreased the plasma cells have been found remarkably increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells30 moreover several new b cell-receptor changes have been identified eg ighv323 and ighv3730 in addition isotypes including ighv315 ighv330 and igkv311 previously used for virus vaccine development have been confirmed30 the strongest pairing frequencies ighv323-ighj4 has been suggested to indicate a monoclonal state associated with sars-cov-2 specificity30 moreover given the pivotal role of b cells in the control of infections tracking the antibody seroconversion response is an important process for the clinical evaluation of infections in covid-19 patients while serum samples from patients with covid-19 showed no cross-binding to the s1 subunit of the sars-cov spike antigen some cross-reactivity of serum samples has been observed from patients with covid-19 to nucleocapsid antigens of sars-cov31 interestingly this study reports that 968 of tested patients achieved seroconversion of igg or igm within 20 days after symptom onset with a titer plateaued within 6 days after seroconversion31 moreover 100 of patients had positive virus-specific igg approximately 1719 days after symptom onset31 instead 941 patients showed positive virus-specific igm approximately 2022 days after symptom onset31in addition to these observations about immunity a critical aspect has to be raised concerning the ability to escape from anti-viral host defenses viral evasion of host immune response is in fact believed to play a major role in disease severity32 as an example sars-cov and mers-cov escape and suppress the signaling pathways mediated by type i interferon ifn a key cytokine secreted by virus-infected cells to enroll nearby cells to heighten their anti-viral immune defenses33 based on genomic sequence comparison and on partial identity of sars-cov-2 with sars-cov it is speculative that sars-cov-2 can adopt similar strategies to modulate the host innate immune response thus evading immune detection and dampening human defensesmounting clinical evidence from severe covid-19 patients suggests that extensive changes in the serum levels of several cytokines play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of covid-19223435 such hypercytokinemia the so-called cytokine storm has been proposed as one of the key leading factors that trigger the pathological processes leading to plasma leakage vascular permeability and disseminated vascular coagulation observed in covid-19 patients and accounting for life-threatening respiratory symptoms17 huang et al16 found that plasma concentrations of il-1 il-1ra il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 basic fgf g-csf gm-csf ifn- ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1 mip-1 pdgf tnf and vegf were higher in both icu intensive care unit patients and non-icu patients than in healthy adults moreover when comparing icu and non-icu patients plasma concentrations of il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1 and tnf were higher in icu patients than non-icu patients thus indicating that the cytokine storm might be correlated with disease severity16 another study on a small set of patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia found 15 cytokines ifn-2 ifn- il-1ra il-2 4 7 10 12 and 17 chemokine ip-10 as well as g-csf and m-csf associated with lung injury based on murray score35 evidence from literature indicates that the cytokine storm observed in covid-19 resembles that occurring in cytokines release syndrome crs a form of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and in secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh an hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia with multiorgan failure mainly induced by viral infections2236 therefore as detailed below existing pharmaceutical modulators of cytokines might be repurposed as therapeutic strategy to attenuate the hypercytokinemia in covid-19 patientsinterestingly gou et al37 recently reported that the disruption of gut microbiome features by host and environmental factors may predispose healthy individuals to abnormal inflammatory response observed in covid-19 in particular the authors constructed a blood proteomic risk score for the prediction of covid-19 progression to clinically severe phase and observed that core gut microbiota features were significantly correlated with proinflammatory cytokines in a set of 366 individuals using a machine learning model37 specifically bacteroides genus streptococcus genus and clostridiales order have been negatively correlated with most of the tested inflammatory cytokines whereas ruminococcus genus blautia genus and lactobacillus genus have been positively associated37 moreover fecal metabolomics analysis indicated some potential amino acid-related pathways eg aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis pathway arginine biosynthesis pathway and valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis pathway that correlate core microbial features with host inflammation among 987 participants37 thus the core intestinal microbiological characteristics along with its related metabolites should be further investigated as potential predictors for the individual susceptibility to covid-19 progression and severity and might represent potential targets for the prevention of susceptible populations as well as for the development of therapeutic approaches to manage covid-19the transcription factor nf-b is a critical regulator of both innate and adaptive immunity41 under basal conditions nf-b is retained in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory proteins ibs a variety of cellular stimuli including pathogens induce ib phosphorylation ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome thereby promoting nf-b nuclear translocation41 in the nucleus nf-b induces the transcription of a wide spectrum of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines stress-response proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins nf-b activity is essential for survival and activation and for initiating and propagating optimal immune responses42 by contrast the constitutive activation of the nf-b pathway is often associated with inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma notably the exacerbation of nf-b activation has been reported to be implicated in lung inflammatory immunopathology induced by respiratory viruses including sars-cov4344 moreover wang and collaborators demonstrated that in murine macrophages cell line raw2647 the exposure to recombinant sars-cov spike protein induced a massive protein release of il-6 and tnf in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in the supernatants and that such increase in il-6 and tnf secretion relies on the activation of nf-b signaling pathway45 in fact sars-cov spike protein has been associated with an increase in ib degradation an essential step required for the activation of nf-b signaling pathway45 accordingly transfection with dominant-negative nik which inhibits nf-b activation produced a strong reduction in spike protein il-6 and tnf release in raw2647 cells thus demonstrating that nf-b is required for the induction of il-6 and tnf by sars-cov spike protein45 such in vitro data were consistent with results obtained in vivo where treatments with drugs inhibiting nf-b activation such as caffeic acid phenethyl ester cape bay 117082 and parthenolide reduced inflammation by suppressing the mrna expression of tnf cxcl2 and mcp-1 in the lung of sars-cov-infected mice moreover pharmacological inhibition of nf-b protected against pulmonary pathology and enhanced mice survival after sars-cov infection43in line with these findings smits et al demonstrated that sars-cov-infected aged macaques show in the lungs an increase in nf-b nuclear translocation as a result of nf-b activation and developed a stronger host response to virus infection compared with young adult macaques with a significant increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes mainly regulated by nf-b44taken together these data suggest that nf-b inhibition might be an effective strategy to counteract pathogenic sars-cov however targeting nf-b is an approach strongly limited by intrinsic pathways complexity molecules blocking nf-b lack for specificity and interfere with nf-b physiological roles in cellular homeostasis resulting in increased risk of undesired side effects such as a broad suppression of innate immunity46 moreover within the context of viral infection a major limitation of targeting nf-b signaling depends on the ability of viruses to efficiently escape by encoding proteins specifically blocking this pathway46 thus a promising strategy may rely on directly targeting the downstream effectors of the pathway such as tnf whose expression is mainly controlled by nf-b transcriptional activity while tnf is known to play a key role in the coordination and development of the inflammatory response especially in the acute phase long-lasting and excessive production of tnf may become less effective by possibly altering tnftnf receptor signaling threshold which after an initial wave of nf-b activation favors sustained basal nf-b activity47 in addition despite many other pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators are involved in the cytokine storm specific blockade of tnf has been reported to be clinically effective in several pathological conditions accordingly tnf blockers such as infliximab and adalimumab have been successfully used for the treatment of several immune-mediated disorders such as psoriasis rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel diseases and ankylosing spondylitis4849 hence anti-tnf monoclonal antibodies are likely to attenuate inflammatory processes occurring in covid-19 reducing the release of other inflammatory-exacerbating mediators indeed when an anti-tnf is administrated in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis it has been demonstrated to induce a rapid decrease of a broad spectrum of cytokines eg il-6 and il-1 as well as of others acute-phase related proteins and vascular permeability factor5052furthermore the envelope viral spike protein of sars-cov has been found to promote the activity of tnf-converting enzyme tace-dependent shedding of ace2 receptor which is a fundamental step for virus entry into the cell53 thus tnf blockers represent effective therapeutic tools to counteract sars-cov infection by exerting a dual mechanism of action attenuation of inflammation and inhibition of viral infection45 however warnings about the potential increased risk of bacterial and fungal superinfections due to anti-tnf therapy have to be taken into account54 taking into account the sequence similarities between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and the strong limitation in directly inhibiting nf-b to date a clinical trial investigating adalimumab for the management of covid-19 has been registered in the chinese clinical trial registry chictr2000030089 and is expected to run until august 2020 however further investigations concerning the use and safety of tnf-blockers in covid-19 patients are urgently neededin addition concerning a potential intervention on nf-b signaling pathway serine protease inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases eg camostat mesylate nafamostat mesylate gabexate mesylate ulinastatin used for the treatment of pancreatitis disseminated intravascular coagulation and anticoagulant for hemodialysis5556 have been found to inhibit viral replication5758 and to attenuate inflammatory processes in different pathological contexts such as asthma chronic allergic pulmonary inflammation and inflammatory myocardial injury5962 for instance nafamostat mesylate and gabexate mesylate have been demonstrated to attenuate allergen-induced airway inflammation and eosinophilia in mouse model of allergic asthma61 thus reducing mast cell activation eosinophils infiltrations in the lung and dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-driven il-4 and tnf production in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid61 furthermore treatment with nafamostat mesylate downregulated the expression of il-1 tnf il-6 eotaxin inducible no synthase inos cd86 and nf-b activation but enhanced the expression of il-12 and il-10 in dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-driven il-4 and tnf production in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid61 moreover gabexate mesylate has been found to inhibit lps-induced tnf production in human monocytes by blocking both nf-b and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation63 thus the pharmacological profile of serine protease inhibitors as inhibitors of complement pathways and broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory agents provide a strong rationale for their use in the management of covid-19 however the specific mechanism of action through which serine protease inhibitors induce their anti-inflammatory effects is still unknownfirst discovered as the primary mediator of intracellular signaling induced by ifn in hematopoietic and immune cells the jakstat signaling is a key pathway transducing extracellular signals transmitted by a large number of cytokines lymphokines and growth factors in particular a subset of cytokines employs the jakstat signaling pathway in order to induce their biological effects notably one of the major activators of jakstat signaling is the cytokine il-6 which has been reported to be dramatically increased in covid-19 patients2022 with a strong implication in acute inflammation and cytokine storm in particular il-6 has been reported to activate numerous cell types expressing the glycoprotein gp130 receptor and the membrane-bound il-6 receptor as well as a soluble form of il-6 receptor interacting with gp130 thereby promoting the downstream activation of jakstat signaling64 in turn the activation of jakstat pathway has been reported to stimulate the production of il-665 such signaling pathway has been reported to be aberrantly activated in patients with chronic inflammation conditions such as arthritis rheumatoid and it is likely that its excessive overactivation may also occur in covid-19 patients thereby exacerbating the host inflammatory response noteworthy chronic elevation of circulating il-6 has been widely recognized as a predictor for increased risk of cardiovascular events6667 consistently il-6 is produced from several tissues including activated macrophages and endothelial and smooth muscle cells where it promotes the secretion of other cytokines and among others it stimulates mcp-1 secretion from macrophages to promote atherogenesis68 increases the expression of cell adhesion molecules6970 and stimulates the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells71 thus the abnormal increase in il-6 levels may be implicated at least in part in the occurrence cardiovascular diseases eg coronary atherosclerosis inflammation in the vascular system resulting in diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis observed in covid-19 patients72 accordingly the synthesis and secretion of il-6 has been demonstrated to be induced by angiotensin ii which is locally produced by the inflamed vessels in a jakstat-dependent manner73 in particular angiotensin ii binding to angiotensin ii receptor type 1 at1 receptor has been found to activate jakstat pathway and to promote the downstream production of il-67374 increased angiotensin ii enhances il-6 production in at1jakstat-dependent manner thus establishing a positive inflammatory feedback loop interestingly the spike protein of sars-cov has been demonstrated to downregulate ace2 expression thus resulting in over-production of angiotensin ii by the related enzyme ace7576 in a similar way it could be hypothesized that sars-cov-2 may downregulate ace2 receptors thus leading to an over-production of angiotensin ii in turn enhancing il-6 production in at1jakstat-dependent manner and ultimately driving to vascular inflammation and lung injury clinical signatures of covid-19 fig 2 moreover the angiotensin iiat1 receptor axis has been reported to also activate both nf-b and adam1777 notably an important substrate for adam17 is ace2 whose cleavage by adam17 has been reported to inactivate it enhancing angiotensin ii retention thus leading to hypertension cardiovascular remodeling and other types of pathophysiology associated with enhancement of the renin-angiotensin system77 beside its implication in the shedding of ace2 receptor fundamental for virus entry53 adam17 induction has been found to process the membrane form of il-6 receptor  il-6r to the soluble form sil-6r followed by the gp130-mediated activation of stat3 via the sil-6r-il-6 complex in a variety of il-6r-negative non-immune cells78 the activation of stat3 has been reported to be required for the complete induction of nf-b pathway78 thus sars-cov-2 infection may activate both nf-b and stat3 signaling which in turn can promote the il-6 amplifier mechanism required for the hyper-activation of nf-b by stat3 thereby inducing multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases78 the il-6 amplifier promotes the production and secretion of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as il-6 and the recruitment of lymphoid and myeloid cells sustaining the il-6 amplifier-driven positive feedback loop as proposed by hirano and murakami79 fig 2 furthermore the metalloprotease adam17 has been found to mediate angiotensin ii-induced egfr epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation by generating the mature form of heparin-binding egf-like growth factor in vascular smooth muscle cells thus leading to vascular remodeling77 notably egfr transactivation is critical for angiotensin ii-mediated cardiovascular complications77 in this regard the egfr kinase inhibitor erlotinib has been recently repurposed for the treatment of covid-19 based on its capability to reduce the infectivity of a wide range of viruses8082 beside its antiviral activity the implication of egfr transactivation in cardiovascular complications represent another theoretical foundation for the use of erlotinib in the management of covid-19 patientsmoreover given the importance of angiotensin iiat1 receptor axis the attempt to use angiotensin ii-receptor blockers as a therapeutic benefit in covid-19 by targeting the host response to the virus has been made83 however their use needs to be deepened since ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii-receptor blockers have been suggested to further increase the risk of covid-19 infection by up-regulating ace284 whether patients affected by covid-19 and hypertension taking an ace inhibitors or angiotensin ii-receptor blockers should switch to another antihypertensive drug is still a matter of debate and further evidence is requiredsince il-6 appears a key driver of cytokine storm and of its consequent detrimental effects monoclonal antibodies against il-6 such as tocilizumab and sarilumab have been also proposed to dampen this process tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody il-6 receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and crs has been used in clinical practice in order to manage severe cases of covid-19 and it has been included in the current chinese national treatment guidelines httpswwwchinalawtranslatecomwp-contentuploads202003who-translationpdf to date 40 clinical trials typing covid-19 and tocilizumab on clinicaltrialsgov and clinicaltrialsregistereu are underway to test tocilizumab alone or in combination in patients with covid-19 moreover 18 clinical trials typing covid-19 and tocilizumab on clinicaltrialsgov and clinicaltrialsregistereu will study the efficacy and safety of another il-6 receptor antagonist sarilumab approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with covid-19beside monoclonal antibodies specifically targeting il-6 approved drugs inhibiting il-6jakstat signaling may represent a valuable tool in particular jak signaling inhibitors such as baricitinib fedratinib and ruxolitinib  approved for indications such as rheumatoid arthritis and myelofibrosis  have been reported to attenuate the host inflammatory response associated with massive pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine release85 based on this anti-inflammatory effect they are likely to be effective against the consequences of the elevated levels of cytokines typically observed in patients with covid-1980 among them baricitinib a selective inhibitor of jak 1 and 2 has been predicted by crystallographic studies to inhibit two members of the numb-associated kinase family such as ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 and cyclin g-associated kinase gak thus hindering viral endocytosis into lung cells at the concentration approved for the treatment of arthritis rheumatoid86 however despite such undeniable advantages the repurposing of baricitinib and in general of jak inhibitors for the management of covid-19 is debated in particular concerns arise mainly from evidence reporting that the activation of jakstat pathway mediated by ifns is required for the induction of many ifn-regulated genes playing a pivotal role as innate early defense system against viral infections the defensive role of jakstat pathway is corroborated by evidence demonstrating that the majority of virus have developed escaping strategies such as the production of viral-encoded factors blocking this pathway which are recognized as crucial determinants of virulence87 therefore inhibition of jakstat signaling is likely to produce an impairment of ifn-related antiviral response exacerbating sars-cov-2 infection however since several benefits such as the blockage of virus entry and the attenuation of host excessive inflammatory response as well as vascular and lung damage provide a strong rationale for the use of baricitinib in the management of covid-19 patients the balance between positive and negative aspects of jakstat signaling inhibition has to be still drawn upto date several clinical trials are testing the efficacy and safety jak inhibitors in covid-19 patients typing covid-19 and jak inhibitors on clinicaltrialsgov and clinicaltrialsregistereuthe sphingosine-1-phosphate s1p 1 has emerged as a crucial signaling lipid regulator of inflammation and immune response including lymphocyte trafficking vascular integrity and cytokine and chemokine production88 beside s1p role of second messenger during inflammation most of s1p effects on innate and adaptive immunity are mediated by its binding to five g-protein-coupled receptors s1prs15 which are differentially expressed in tissues88 among them s1p1 receptor is ubiquitously expressed and coupled with a g inhibitory protein89 the activation of s1p1 receptor is associated with raserk pi3kaktenos and plcca2 downstream pathways89 notably under physiological and pathological conditions the s1ps1pr1 axis has been demonstrated to regulate the trafficking and migration of numerous types of immune cells including t and b lymphocytes nk cells dendritic cells88 moreover the s1p1 receptor signaling pathways have been reported to inhibit the pathological damage induced by the host innate and adaptive immune responses thus attenuating the cytokine storm observed in influenza virus infection40 in particular teijaro et al40 demonstrated that in mice infected with awisconsinwslh3493909 influenza virus s1p1 receptor subtype regulates a crucial signaling loop fundamental for the initiation of cytokine storm in respiratory endothelial cells the administration of s1p1 agonist blunted cytokine storm by significantly inhibiting secretion of cytokines and chemokines associated with influenza virus-induced pathology such as ifn- ccl2 il-6 tnf and ifn-40 notably in endothelial cells suppression of early innate immune responses through s1p1 signaling has been found to decrease mortality during influenza virus infection in mice40 interestingly in a later work by the same group activation of s1p1 signaling has been demonstrated to block cytokine and chemokine production as well as immune cell activation and recruitment in the lungs of mice infected with the h1n1 wsn strain of influenza virus90 moreover s1p1 agonism has been found to reduce cytokine storm independently of tlr3 and tlr7 signaling as well as of multiple endosome and cytosolic innate pathogen-sensing pathways90 in contrast s1p1r agonism has been found to suppress cytokine and chemokine production by targeting myd88 myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88trif tir-domain-containing adapter-inducing ifn- signaling two common actors with nf-b pathway90 however s1p1r agonism is likely to modulate other signaling pathways that have not yet identifiedthus based on the effects of s1p receptor signaling on multiple immunological processes indicating such pathway a promising for the modulation of harmful inflammatory responses the application of therapies targeting s1p and s1p signaling may be repurposed for immune-mediated disorders and inflammatory conditions such as covid-19 for instance sp1 agonists approved for multiple sclerosis such as fingolimod might be used as therapeutic tools to dampen cytokine and chemokine responses in those patients displaying excessive immune responses to date only one non-randomized phase ii clinical trial is underway to establish the efficacy of fingolimod in the treatment of covid-19 nct04280588 typing covid-19 and fingolimod on clinicaltrialsgovthe covid-19 pandemic induced by the novel sars-cov-2 represents one of the greatest global public health emergencies since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918 and provides an unprecedented challenge for the identification of both preventive and therapeutic drugs in particular vaccines and effective therapeutics to tackle this novel virus are urgently needed fortunately in the last decade vaccine technology has significantly evolved with the development of several rna and dna vaccine candidates licensed vectored vaccines recombinant proteins and cell culture-based vaccines for many indications91 moreover given the similarities of sars-cov-2 with sars-cov the ideal target for the vaccine the spike s protein on the surface of the virus required for viral entry has been quickly identified providing a target antigen to incorporate into advanced vaccine platforms thus antibodies specifically targeting the s protein can block the binding of sars-cov-2 to the host ace2 receptor thus neutralizing the virus however given the lesson learned from sars and mers the development of the vaccine against sars-cov-2 is likely to be an uphill road with several obstacles in fact several vaccines for sars-cov including recombinant s protein-based vaccines have been already developed and tested in animal models but many did not produce sterilizing immunity in animal models andor induced severe side effects such as lung and liver damage9293 to date no human cov vaccines have been approved so far moreover to complicate this scenario it has to be still unveiled whether infection with covs induces long-lived antibody response protecting against the risk of relapsing infections thus scientific community has to overcome several issues for the development of an effective and safe sars-cov-2 vaccine in this regard ling et al recently detected sars-cov-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in 8 covid-19 patients recently become virus-free and consequently discharged94 in addition the neutralizing antibody titers have been significantly correlated with the numbers of nucleocapsid protein-specific t cells94 such evidence indicates that both b and t cells cooperate to protect the host from viral infection notably despite the small sample size this study laid a theoretical foundation for the diagnosis of infectious diseases the tracing of past infections as well as the development of therapeutic antibody drugs and the design of an effective vaccine consistently long et al reported acute antibody responses to sars-cov-2 in a cohort of 285 patients with covid-1931 in particular 19 days after symptom onset 100 of patients have been tested positive for antiviral igg and seroconversion for igg and igm have been reported to occur simultaneously or sequentially31 thus serological testing might be useful to identify suspected patients with negative rt-pcr results as well as asymptomatic infections31however the speed at which sars-cov-2 is spreading has emphasized the urgent need to identify alternative therapeutic strategies in order to contain viral infection and to attenuate the excessive host immune response during the lag of vaccine availability especially in a scenario where the virus may become endemic and recurrent seasonal epidemics may occur in this regard several antiviral drugs such as remdesivir lopinavir and ritonavir are currently tested in several clinical trials either alone or in combination and compassionate use of these drugs has already been reported for sars-cov-29596 however antiviral drugs might select for mutational escape thus rendering this therapeutic approach ineffective moreover still unconfirmed reports indicate sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence regarding the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as prophylactic agent97 with evidence of safety from long-time use in clinical practice for the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases98 however their use needs further evidence and clinical evaluation chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are known to potentially cause heart rhythm problems that may be exacerbated whether combined with other drugs with similar effects on the heart and induce adverse liver kidney and cerebral effects99 thus as discussed in this review treatments addressing the immunopathology of the infection such as immunomodulatory drugs approved for different clinical indications have become a major focus such approaches show the advantage to override viral mutational escape and to exert less-selective pressure on viral population although the prospective of counteracting cytokine storm is compelling a major limitation relies on the limited understanding of the immune signaling pathways triggering such process hence future dissection of immune signaling pathways triggered by sars-cov-2 will provide novel insight on the effects of the virus on human immune system and may reveal relevant biological players that can be targeted to blunt cytokine storm notably since it is well established that innate immune responses trigger the activation of multiple and redundant signaling pathways an effective therapy may require to acting at the same time on multiple signaling pathways in this regard cocktails of immunomodulatory drugs such as monoclonal antibody targeting a specific cytokine eg tnf- inhibitors il-1-inhibitors il-6 inhibitors corticosteroids eg prednisone methylprednisolone and dexamethasone and s1pr1 agonists eg fingolimod rather than a single drug might be more effective in the management of covid-19 by exerting either synergic or additive effects in this regard it would be of key importance to assess whether patients with immune-mediated disorders treated with immunomodulatory drugs such as cytokine blockers are more resistant to the excessive immune response observed in covid-19 patients and more protected against sars-cov-2-driven pneumonia however to date no evidence reporting either decreased or increased risk of sars-cov-driven pneumonia has been documented in this patients and further investigations are required to verify this hypothesisfurthermore another aspect to better investigate concerns the possibility that the uncontrolled immune response to viral infection may cause detrimental systemic effects on several physiological systems such as the nervous endocrine renal and cardiovascular systems accordingly it is likely that the massive cytokine and chemokine release may critically impact on these physiological systems thereby inducing both short- and long-term detrimental effects as an example the neuro-invasive potential of sars-cov and mers-cov has been previously reported100 thus given the high similarity between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 it is likely that this latter displays a similar potential101103 as a matter of fact a study carried out in 214 covid-19 patients reported that about 88 of severe covid-19 cases showed neurologic manifestations such as acute cerebrovascular diseases and impaired consciousness104finally beside the putative long-term effects directly induced by sars-cov-2 infection another key issue to address concerns the long-term effects of empirical and experimental treatments in covid-19 patients in this regard a study carried out in 25 recovered sars patients recruited 12 years after the viral infection reported significant differences in the serum metabolomes in recovered sars patients compared with controls105 in particular a significant metabolic alteration  increased levels of phosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidylinositol  has been found to coincide with the effect of methylprednisolone administration105 thus suggesting that high-dose pulses of steroid treatment may induce long-term systemic damage associated with serum metabolic alterations105therefore all the challenges discussed above highlight some of the major gaps in our knowledge of covid-19 clinical spectrum underlying immune signaling pathways systemic effects and long-term pathological signatures which need to be urgently fulfilled by future investigationsthe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an acute respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 identified in wuhan china in december 2019 1 since then the covid-19 outbreak has spread worldwide becoming a pandemic causing a public health emergency according to the world health organization who and resulting in thousands of deaths 1 sars-cov-2 is a -coronavirus an enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna virus which could be transmitted from bats via unknown intermediate hosts to infect humans using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor 2 the latter is more expressed in adults than children and thus possibly explains why the disease is more aggressive in older patients 3 covid-19 shows a heterogeneous course from patients affected by mild flu-like symptoms to patients with unremitting fever and severe respiratory involvement on this basis markers of poor prognosis have recently been investigated to effectively prioritize resources to patients with more severe symptoms 4 interestingly this study identified hyperferritinemia and interleukin il-6 as predictors of poor outcome thus suggesting a hyper-inflammatory process as the major cause of death 4 5 in severe covid-19 a specific cytokine profile resembling the pattern of a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh has been shown due to significant increases of il-2 il-7 granulocyte colony stimulating factor gcsf interferon- inducible protein 10 ip-10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1- and tumor necrosis factor tnf 6 contextualizing unremitting fever hyperferritinemia and the hyper-inflammatory process severe covid-19 shows similarity to disorders comprised in the so-called hyperferritinemic syndrome 7 this syndrome includes adult onset stills disease aosd systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis sjia secondary hlh catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome caps and septic shock 7 hyperferritinemia is a common trait of all these forms which could be an active pathogenic mediator and not only a consequence of the inflammation 7 on these bases we aimed to review the similarities between severe covid-19 and diseases included in hyperferritinemic syndrome from a pathogenic clinical and therapeutic point of view thus proposing new insights to improve the management of those patientscoronavirus rnas may act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns which are detected by the pattern recognition receptors and activate downstream cascades pro-inflammatory pathways 1 6 in the endosome toll-like receptor tlr 3 tlr7 tlr8 and tlr9 may sense viral rna and dna 8 whereas in the cytoplasm the viral rna receptor retinoic-acid inducible gene i 9 cytosolic receptor melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 and nucleotidyltransferase cyclic guanosine monophosphateadenosine monophosphate gmp-amp synthase may recognize viral rna and dna 10 consequently downstream cascades molecules are triggered involving adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation primary response 88 myd88 transcription factor nuclear factor-b nf-b and interferon regulatory factor 3 leading to the production of pro-inflammatory molecules 11 12 in fact plasma cytokines and chemokines were increased in covid-19 patients including il-1 il-2 il-4 il-7 il-10 il-12 il-13 il-17 gcsf ip-10 interferon- ifn- and tnf 6 during severe covid-19 these mechanisms could be exaggerated probably because of a specific genetic susceptibility 13 and these patients are characterized by very high blood levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and ferritin 4 5 the latter is an iron-binding molecule which is produced after pro-inflammatory stimuli in addition to iron availability 7 furthermore ferritin comprises 24 subunits codified according to their molecular weight into heavy feh and light fel subunits remarkably increased expression of feh and of cd68feh macrophages may be observed in inflammatory infiltrate of aosd and secondary hlh 14 15 additionally a stimulatory effect of feh on nf-kb has been described acting as a pro-inflammatory cytokine on hepatic stellate cells 16 in this work ferritin was shown to regulate an iron-independent signaling pathway that resulted ultimately in nf-kb activation 16 thus converging on the same pathway elicited by sars-cov-2 rnas 11 12 on the contrary the deletion of feh reduced the inflammatory burden in the model of sepsis by lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia cecal ligation and puncture 17 such protection was predominantly mediated by the compensatory increase in fel associated with an inhibitory action on nf-kb 17 the pro-inflammatory cytokines which are elevated in hyperferritinemic syndrome have also been described in severe covid-19 6 and may preferentially induce the expression of feh via fer2 a regulatory element acting as a binding site to nf-kb the latter in turn stimulates the synthesis of further feh and pro-inflammatory cytokines thus perpetuating a vicious inflammatory loop 7 in addition fehil-12 macrophages have been shown in the infiltrate of aosd and secondary hlh 15 18 which may further release feh following inflammatory stimuli 19 and thus contributing to the inflammatory loop 20 on these bases we hypothesize that severe covid-19 shares common pathogenic mechanisms with other diseases of hyperferritinemic syndrome 7 with ferritin enhancing the inflammatory burden and triggering a vicious pathogenic looplung involvement and hyper-inflammation are at the crossroad between severe covid-19 and the hyperferritinemic syndrome as observed in other -coronaviruses diseases covid-19 is characterized by fever dry cough increasing dyspnoea with hypoxemia and bilateral ground-glass opacities and patchy shadowing with a peripheral or posterior distribution mainly in the lower lobes on chest ct scans 6 in fact an anatomy report of a covid-19 pneumonia cadaver showed that sars-cov-2 invades the respiratory mucosa and infects other cells thus provoking an inflammatory response in the lower airway and causes lung injury 21 considering that coronavirus binds to the host cells using the ace2 receptor which is highly represented in the lower respiratory tract a persistent and repeated stimulation of tlrs in the lung may occur hence triggering an aberrant immune response and the production of a cytokine storm 22 the latter is the result of overwhelming systemic inflammation with a massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines quickly progressing to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and eventually to death 23 in spite of various inflammatory etiologies cytokine release syndrome is supported by an essential underlying hypothesis the massive release of cytokines as a consequence of i excessive and repeated inflammatory stimuli and ii an inadequate regulation of inflammation iii an uncontrolled release of cytoplasmic cytokines from destroyed lymphocytes after anti-cancer therapies 23 24 in addition it has been shown that increased amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-1 il-6 il-12 ifn- ip-10 and mcp1 were associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in sars patients 25 thus suggesting a further pathogenic loop in inducing the cytokine storm although the mechanisms of how covid-19 and in other more general viral infections would prompt the cytokine storm syndrome are not fully elucidated it has been suggested that the ifn- which is largely released by a variety of hematopoietic cells in response to viral infection may facilitate the occurrence of hyper-inflammation 23 in patients with sjia lung involvement may trigger systemic inflammation and the development of secondary hlh and ifn- plays a central pathogenic role 26 27 in fact in lung biopsies in patients with sija the analysis of expressed genes revealed that many of the up-regulated targets were in gene pathways related to an ifn- signature including human leukocyte antigen hlad family members and other ifn-related genes 26 27 two of the most highly up-regulated non-hla genes were chemokine c-x-c motif cxcl9 and cxcl10 26 which are ifn-induced chemokines strongly correlated with the occurrence of secondary hlh 28 in addition the lung is one of the major physiological producers of il-1 and il-6 29 which are also involved in pathogenic steps leading to the occurrence of secondary hlh 30 31 considering all of these findings it is possible to postulate that during the acute respiratory distress syndrome of covid-19 the sars-cov-2 may trigger a hyper-inflammatory reaction strongly resembling that observed in the lung involvement of sjia in which the lung acts as a trigger to amplify the immune response the final result is the uncontrolled proliferation of activated immune cells the massive production of pro-inflammatory mediators and the development of cytokine storm syndrome either in severe covid-19 or sjiafrom a clinical point of view severe covid-19 and the diseases included in hyperferritinemic syndrome share a fever as the main clinical symptom in these conditions the analysis of fever pattern would also suggest a useful clue to assess the severity of the disease and the occurrence of complications in sjia and aosd a typical change from the high-spiking intermittent typical quotidian pattern to a continuous unremitting pattern suggests the occurrence of secondary hlh and the worsening of the clinical situation toward a life-threatening hyper-inflammatory complication 32 during covid-19 on the basis of observations from clinicians on the frontlines the occurrence of unremitting fever would similarly identify a more aggressive subset of patients at higher risk of a poor prognosis in addition in severe covid-19 hyperferritinemia is observed suggesting a marker of severity 4 5 although it has poor specificity a 5-fould increase of ferritin is strongly suggestive of the diseases included in hyperferritinemic syndrome and is a useful marker to assess disease activity and to predict a poor prognosis 20 in fact hyperferritinemia is associated with increased mortality in sepsis multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and critical illness 3335 thus the clinical phenotype characterized by unremitting fever and hyperferritinemia identifies the most severe subset of covid-19 as observed in the diseases included in hyperferritinemic syndromeconsidering the lack of efficacy of antiviral therapy for severe coronavirus infection it is reasonable to postulate the clinical usefulness of specific immunomodulatory therapies figure 1 as observed for other diseases included in hyperferritinemic syndrome such as intravenous immunoglobulins ivigs and tocilizumab the humanized monoclonal antibody against il-6 receptor 7 ex juvantibus one of the best criteria for identifying a common pathogenic mechanism among different diseases is that the clinical manifestations were reversed upon initiation of the same therapy it has been shown that after ivigs therapy a significant reduction of hyperferritinemia both in sepsis and secondary hlh was observed correlating with an improvement in patients 7 considering their proposed anti-viral activity possibly comprising many cross-reacting anti-viral antibodies and per se immunomodulatory activities 36 ivigs has also been proposed to treat severe covid-19 37 another therapeutic immunomodulatory possibility in severe covid-19 is the administration of hydroxychloroquine hcq this drug has been a licensed treatment for rheumatoid arthritis for many years and was shown to reduce the viral load favoring the disappearance of sars-cov-2 38 however although it seems promising a recent meta-analysis including 1358 patients suggested that more data are required for a definitive conclusion on the use of hcq in this setting since no difference was observed in virologic cure death or clinical worsening of disease between hcq-treated patients and control groups 39 as far as tocilizumab is concerned the rationale for its use in severe covid-19 derived from evidence of its beneficial effect on cytokine release syndrome this is a clinically significant on-target off-tumor side effect of the chimeric antigen receptor t-cell therapies administered for treatment of malignancies 24 characteristics of cytokine-release syndrome include fever encephalopathy hypotension and coagulopathy leading to multiorgan failure associated with very pronounced levels of hyperferritinemia and il-6 24 the latter provided an effective therapeutic target in cytokine release syndrome 40 mirroring this finding tocilizumab has been used to treat severe covid-19 with promising results as observed in other diseases of hyperferritinemic syndrome 7 furthermore a reduction of ferritin obtained by combing immunomodulatory drugs was associated with a lower mortality rate in caps and hlh 7 thus possibly suggesting the use of in a more aggressive subset of covid-19 a combination therapy with both antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs at the same time 41 in addition the repurposing of these drugs in severe covid-19 could benefit from the findings of previous reports and thus on this basis many clinical trials are ongoing in different countries chictr2000029765 nct04317092 nct04310228 and nct04332913as far as other immunomodulatory strategies in covid-19 are concerned il-1 inhibition showed benefits in sepsis in which both hyperferritinemia and hyper-inflammation may be observed contributing to the dysregulation of the host immune system 42 a post-hoc analysis of data from a phase 3 randomized controlled trial showed some improvement of patients with sepsis following anakinra a recombinant non-glycosylated form of human il-1 receptor antagonist thus suggesting its possible use in those patients 42 as a consequence it is possible to hypothesize that anakinra may also relieve severe covid-19 reported data suggest the possible efficacy of emapalumab a monoclonal antibody neutralizing ifn-y approved in the treatment of hlh and its massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 43 due to the important role of ifn-y in driving hyper-inflammation during viral infections emapalumab may be an additional immunomodulatory therapy that could be employed in the treatment of severe covid-19 in addition available literature suggests that janus kinase jak inhibition might affect covid-19 twice as much by targeting both inflammation and cellular viral entry 44 it has been proposed that baricitinib a jak1jak2 inhibitor may control the hyper-inflammatory steps in those diseases characterized by a cytokine storm since a plethora of cytokine receptors indiscriminately use these jaks as mediators of ligands binding and consequent activation of the inflammatory cascade 45 furthermore the disruption of p2-associated protein kinase 1 a known regulator of viral endocytosis into the cell by baricitinib could possibly be an additional positive effect in covid-19 decreasing the viral entry 44 finally considering ferritin as a pathogenic mediator this could also be proposed as a therapeutic target in these conditions high-volume hemofiltration and plasma exchange extracorporeal blood purification techniques have been employed to treat secondary hlh to sepsis 4648 interestingly in parallel with the clinical efficacy these procedures induce a ferritin reduction 4648 suggesting that the mechanical removal of ferritin could have a possible therapeutic rolein this work we discuss the similarities from a pathogenic clinical and therapeutic point of view between severe covid-19 and four conditions secondary hlh aosd caps and septic shock which are included in hyperferritinemic syndrome all these diseases are characterized by very high levels of ferritin which could not only be the product of the inflammation but rather may play a pathogenic role possibly in an inflammatory environment as observed in these diseases hyperferritinemia may be involved in a vicious pathogenic loop prompting its pro-inflammatory properties in severe covid-19 ferritin could be a further possible enhancer of the cytokine storm clinically unremitting fever is a common feature of severe covid-19 suggesting that a change from the intermittent quotidian pattern to a continuous unremitting form would indicate a worsening toward the cytokine storm as in aosd and sjia the hyperferritinemia seems to be a marker of poor prognosis and response to treatment in both severe covid-19 and hyperferritinemic syndrome finally the good response to immunomodulatory therapies observed during severe covid-19 strongly supports the link between this form and other diseases included in hyperferritinemic syndrome in addition targeting the hyper-inflammatory process through immunomodulatory therapies decreases the high mortality rate of all these diseases 7 4951 thus proposing additional therapeutic options to improve the survival of severe covid-19 patients the latter characterized by an over-exuberant pro-inflammatory response in which the viral load is not correlated with the worsening of symptoms 6in conclusion we hypothesize that severe covid-19 shares pathogenic mechanisms a clinical picture outcomes and therapeutic strategies with disorders included in hyperferritinemic syndrome the hyperferritinemia characterizing all these diseases may be a pathogenic mediator enhancing the inflammatory burden and as observed in aosd caps and secondary hlh its reduction is associated with a lower mortality thus at present severe covid-19 seems to be a new entity in hyperferritinemic syndrome in addition since accumulating evidence suggests that severe covid-19 is associated with a cytokine storm syndrome therapeutic strategies combining immunomodulatory therapies may improve the management of those patients furthermore in this setting high levels of ferritin identifying a more aggressive subset of covid-19 may drive clinicians to apply more aggressive therapies and resources in those patients thus balancing appropriate escalation of therapy and minimizing the exposure to iatrogenic harm sars-cov-2 and consequent covid-19 are a new and great challenge for health systems worldwide requiring a multidisciplinary approach and a large body of knowledgeall the authors meet all criteria for authorship in the icmje recommendations since all authors made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work the acquisition and interpretation of data all authors contributed to the critical review and revision of the manuscript and approved the final version all the authors agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the workthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestone of the ways lmwf5a may address the excessive cytokine production seen in these patients is by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines released from mononuclear cells infiltrating from blood this is reflected in the ability of lmwf5a to inhibit the release of a key set of cytokines and chemokines associated with sars-cov-2 infection in ex vivo human pbmc models activated through innate pattern recognition pathways for example lmwf5a reduces tnf release by human pbmc stimulated using lps as an agonist for tlr4 signaling fig 1 19 lps-stimulation mimics the pathogen-associated molecular pattern pamp and damp signaling seen in the end stage of disease where excessive viral loads and tissue damage trigger excessive induction of the immune response subsequent unpublished findings show that this response extends to a reduction of cxcl10 il-1 and il-12 as well thus demonstrates that lmwf5a treatment appears to target the release of a pattern of cytokines observed in covid-19 and other viral cytokine storms
tissue resident and blood-derived macrophages are key contributors in the inflammatory response to viral infections and the pro-inflammatory precursors of ards 26 alveolar macrophages are the predominant tissue resident immune cells found in the lung and are likely to be involved in both the early anti-viral response and trophic end-stages of tissue damage and recovery in addition pleiotropic monocytes invading across the capillary-epithelial bed will differentiate into pro-inflammatory m1 macrophages upon arrival and may contribute to the excessive immune response in the lung 26 moreover macrophages that develop into an inflammatory m1 lineage become a potent source of inflammatory cytokines eg tnf il-1 il-6 il-12 cxcl10 furthering inflammation 26 27 of note the balance of macrophage polarization between the microbialifn-induced m1 phenotypes and the anti-inflammatory m2 could dictate the amplitude of classical activation versus neutrophil efferocytosis and immune resolution respectively during pulmonary insult 28in vitro studies using human macrophages further support an immunomodulatory action with lmwf5a treatment by shifting macrophage phenotypes from an inflammatory m1 lineage to an anti-inflammatory m2 lineage 21 in these experiments a human thp-1 monocyte cell line was differentiated to induce macrophage-like characteristics then treated with lmwf5a and stimulated with lps reductions in both secreted cytokine and mrna transcription were observed for the m1 markers il-6 cxcl10 and il-12 importantly the same cells exhibited an increase in the release of the anti-inflammatory m2 marker il-10 with lmwf5a treatment as compared to saline controls the reduction in inflammatory m1-type cytokine release and gene expression combined with increased anti-inflammatory m2-type cytokine release indicates lmwf5a modulates the immune response by shifting the cytokine profile towards homeostasis this shift in macrophage phenotype could reduce macrophage hyperactivity and partially address the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines observed in covid-19although covid-19 may be characterized as an innate response studies also indicate that adaptive cells contribute to the etiology of lung jury as well animal models demonstrate that t-cells facilitate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf and the arrival of neutrophils in the lung 29 as observed with macrophage polarization this may result from an imbalance in inflammatory and regulatory subsets for example the ratio of pro-inflammatory th17 to t regulatory cytokines in the peripheral blood of patients has been found to be predictive of 28-day mortality with ards 30 in support of this evidence activated and proliferating pro-inflammatory t-cells have been detected in bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken from ards patients 31 moreover lymphocyte counts have been associated with increased disease severity in covid-19 with patients who die exhibiting significant leukopenia 32 these cells represent a potentially underappreciated source of both ifn and proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf and contributors of disease progression in covid-19 once in the lung inf priming of t-cells will provide for intense superantigen-like signaling that may exacerbate autocrine and paracrine cytokine activity while their role in covid-19 is yet to be fully elucidated targeting persistent and long-lived immune regulators such as t cells could prove valuable in balancing the immune responseone of the earliest documented activities of lmwf5a is its ability to reduce cytokine release from immune cells stimulated through the t-cell receptor tcr by cd328 antibody or specific antigen presentation lmwf5a was found to reduce tnf and ifn release from cd328-stimulated pbmc and influenza ha antigen-presented human t-cell clones 17 this activity was attributed in part to an identified diketopiperazine molecule formed by the cleavage and cyclization of the two n-terminal amino acids of human serum albumin da-dkp present in lmwf5a treatment of these cells with da-dkp resulted in significant reductions of tnf and ifn release from antigen presented t-cells clones 18 interestingly this effect appears to be specific to memory cd45ro but not nave cd45ra phenotypes unpublished findings these findings demonstrated that lmwf5a can reduce cytokine release during an adaptive immune response triggered by the presentation of antigen or activation of t-cells therefore with respect to covid-19 lmwf5a may shift the overall inflammatory response away from the hyper-cytokine production observed as the disease transitions to ards without impacting the bodys ability to fight the primary viral infectionmechanistically covid-19 pathogenesis seems to be conducted through distinct transcriptional signaling pathways for example activation of nf-b appears to be a hallmark of alveolar macrophages found in patients during ards 33 more importantly inhibition of nf-b has been shown to limit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like il-6 and cxcl10 in mouse models resulting in reduced mortality 34 dysregulation of nf-b activity has been broadly implicated in the production of inflammatory cytokines tnf il-1 il-6 and cell apoptosis 3537 also it has been reported that nf-b signaling pathways can coordinate with other hallmark pro-inflammatory transcription factors in the immune response 38another pro-inflammatory transcription factor associated with lung inflammation is signal transducer and activator of transcription stat the canonical ifn signaling pathway involves the activation of janus kinase and stat1 which promotes m1 polarization of macrophages and augments tcr signaling priming 39 stat1 and stat3 activation has also been shown to be a driving factor in lps-induced lung injury by mediating the release of il-6 and tnf 40 supporting this mechanism inhibition of stat3 reduces the accumulation of immune cells as well as the amount of detectable tnf and il-1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in lps-induced mouse lung ali models 41several lines of preliminary evidence demonstrate that lmwf5a reduces the activity of both nf-b and stat nf-b luciferase hek293 reporter cells treated with lmwf5a and then stimulated with tnf exhibit dose-dependent reductions in nf-b expression as measured by luciferase activity as for stat preliminary experiments using the lps-stimulated human pbmc model described above indicate that lmwf5a reduces stat1 and stat3 activation as measured by dna-binding elisa in nuclear and cytoplasmic protein fractions taken from cells after 24 h in culture while these findings need to be fully evaluated reduction in nf-b activity could reduce the overall inflammatory status of covid-19 patients while a reduction in stat could provide an avenue to help suppress the robust ifn and m1 signaling that appears to trigger the cytokine storm development in these patientsconversely lmwf5a appears to activate the anti-inflammatory andor immunoregulatory transcription factors aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ppar a source of endogenous ahr ligands are tryptophan metabolites and one of the active ingredients in lmwf5a is n-acetyl-tryptophan suggesting that ahr activation contributes to the immunomodulatory action of lmwf5a the effect on ahr activity was confirmed using an ahr antagonist ch223191 in the thp-1 model described above when an ahr antagonist was added to these macrophage-like cultures the il-6 response was partially attenuated demonstrating that the ahr activation plays a partial role in the reducing of cytokine observed in this model however ahr antagonism had no significant effect on cxcl10 inhibition indicating other pathways are involved in lmwf5a activity as well 21 another target pathway for activity was identified based on the fact that endogenous ppar ligands are comprised of fatty acids and their derivatives and lmwf5a contains the fatty acid caprylate furthermore 15-delta prostaglandin j2 15d-pgj2 a resolving prostaglandin known to be a natural ligand for ppar is upregulated by lmwf5a to be discussed more below to establish the contribution of ppar in our models dna-binding and pathway specific antagonism was evaluated preliminary findings suggest that human pbmc treated with lmwf5a exhibited increased ppar dna binding and the addition of the ppar antagonist gw9662 to these cultures results in the attenuation of the lps-induced tnf inhibition together these data indicate that both ahr and ppar transcriptional pathways play a role in the anti-inflammatory responses observed by lmwf5aa large body of evidence suggests that ahr and ppar signaling plays a pivotal role in immunosuppression and the direction of regulatory immune cell phenotypes to illustrate ahr has been shown to suppress nf-b activity by increasing dna binding of the nf-b subunit p50 p50p50 nf-b homodimer to competitively inhibit the active p50 nf-b subunit p65 rela heterodimer 42 sequestering co-regulators rela nf-b subunit relb to prevent translocation into the nucleus 43 and direct trans-repression in the presence of stat1 44 ahr also promotes anti-inflammatory cytokine production il-10 il-21 and the differentiation of t-cells to regulatory phenotypes through cross-talk with the transcription factors proto-oncogene c-maf and stat3 45 46 as with ahr ppar has been shown to suppress nf-b activity by binding to dna and directly interacting with the rela and p50 subunits of nf-b inducing the expression of inhibitor nf-b protein sequestering coactivators required for nf-b such as creb-binding protein and releasing the repressor b-cell lymphoma 6 protein which redirects its activity towards nf-b-mediated promoters 47 this activity decreases the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines regulated by the nf-b pathway including tnf and il-6 47 48 more importantly the ppar agonist rosiglitazone is protective of endotoxin induced ards in rat models with marked reductions in nitric oxide and oxidative damage observed 49 based on these results we suspect that activation of these pathways could help suppress the release of key cytokines such as il-6 during covid-19 provide additional control over pro-inflammatory signaling pathways and potentially rebalance inflammatory immune cells to regulatory and immunotolerant phenotypes that appear to be missing in critical stages of ardsone of the unique aspects of lmwf5a-induced immunomodulation is the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines concomitant with the enhancement of pro-resolving molecules in our lps-stimulated pbmc investigations we found that unlike the steroid dexamethasone which reduces cytokine and prostaglandin release lmwf5a inhibits tnf release while potentiating the production of pro-resolving prostaglandin e2 pge2 and 15d-pgj2 in these cultures fig 2 20 on the other hand treatment with ibuprofen a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug strongly attenuates prostaglandin release but does not result in a significant reduction in tnf release consequently lmwf5a offers a distinctive immunomodulatory profile to other hallmark anti-inflammatory drugs western blot analysis shows that lmwf5a accomplishes this by upregulating prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 cox-2 expression 20 a similar pge2 response is observed in macrophage-like cell culture models using pma-differentiated u937 monocytic cells stimulated with lps suggesting that while lmwf5a can suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines healing and resolution phase mediators are still produced and possibly enhanced by treatment
in regard to covid-19 it is now appreciated that cox-2 plays a critical role in protection through the resolution phase of inflammation hangai et al found that pge2 release from necrotic macrophages may represent a mechanism to suppress damp-induced inflammation and that inhibition of cox-2 results in elevated serum tnf levels in liver necrotic models 50 interestingly studies have also shown that pge2 in the wound site is sufficient to drive the reverse migration of neutrophils as well as promote the apoptosis of neutrophils and efferocytosis critical for the resolution phase of the inflammatory process 51 the authors further hypothesized that this activity is temporally important in part to allow neutrophils to perform critical functions then provide timely resolution while it is certain that damp signaling has evolved to help achieve homeostasis after insult or injury excessive andor sustained responses can exacerbate disease as a result compensatory mechanisms exist within the biologic milieu and it appears that lmwf5a may help drive lipid-mediated feed-back loops of immunosuppressionmore importantly this pathway also appears critical to viral immunity and may afford some protection from the robust inflammation in late phase viral infection that leads to ards for example in some coronavirus studies it has been shown that the virus manipulates prostaglandin release from infected cells during different phases of infection fang et al showed that sars-cov achieves this is by membrane protein-induced down regulation of nf-b with a resulting reduction in cox-2 expression 52 the authors suggest that this is a protective measure by the virus to evade the immune response in the early stages of infection in addition the host response with these molecules also appears to dictate disease progression to illustrate in mouse studies age-related differences in pgd2 release result in defective migration of dendritic cells and cytotoxic cd8 t-cell activity into the lung 53 furthermore it has also been found that anti-inflammatory pgd2 signaling through d-prostanoid receptor 1 reduces inflammasome-induced il-1 release and mortality in coronavirus-infected mice 54 finally influenza studies have established that 15d-pgj2 treatment protects mice against lethal influenza infection through a ppar-dependent mechanism with a marked reduction in viral load and lung inflammation observed 55 it has been theorized that bioactive lipids such as arachidonic acid may serve as endogenous anti-viral compounds thus together with the findings above prostaglandins could provide a therapeutic advantage for ards secondary to viral infections such as covid-19 56there are many clinical parameters that may contribute to the pathogenesis and morbidity associated with covid-19 one of these is dysregulation of the alveolar-epithelial barrier which results in the build-up of protein-rich fluid and decreased oxygen diffusion resolution and repair of the widespread inflammation characteristic of ards depends not only on clearance of infiltrating immune cells and suppression of inflammation but also on removal of fluid and restoration of barrier function interventions that enhance barrier function should provide a rational approach for the treatment and prevention of covid-19research findings suggest that lmwf5a may protect barrier integrity in several ways first and expanding on an intrinsic ability described above prostaglandins and cox-2-derived mediators also appear to promote the recovery of barrier function in both endothelial and epithelial cells to illustrate pge2 release from lps-stimulated a549 epithelial cells acting through pge2 receptor ep4 has been shown to enhance microvascular endothelial cell barrier function 57 moreover murine models indicate that cox-2 derived mediators are protective of acid-induced ali and that selective inhibition delays resolution 58 thus the authors propose that increased cox-2 activity could provide some level of protection against the edema associated with ali 58equally significant lmwf5a and its component da-dkp have been found to impact the activity of enzymes that link extracellular signals to cytoskeletal rearrangements known as small guanosine triphosphate hydrolases gtpases proteomic analysis and pulldown assays of human t-cells stimulated through the tcr shows that da-dkp elevates the phosphorylation and activity of the gtpase ras-related protein rap-1 rap-1 as compared to controls 18 changes in the activity of other gtpases are also observed in bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stems cells bmmsc treated with lmwf5a following treatment with lmwf5a bmmsc exhibit a rapid reduction in the intracellular level of active ras homolog family member a rhoa together with an increase in rac family small gtpase 1 rac1 22 finally da-dkp treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells appears to reduce rhoa activation induced by thrombin unpublished findings this body of evidence provides support for the idea that lmwf5a treatment can rapidly regulate gtpase activity in culturethese molecular switches are intimately linked to a variety of cell processes that help regulate the barrier function of both endothelial and epithelial cells of critical importance specific exchange protein activated by camp epac activation of rap-1 both prevents and reverses dysregulation of vascular function induced by inflammatory cytokines through stabilization of cytoskeletal components 59 as seen in endothelial cells epithelial cell gtpase activity dictates the arrangements and status of f-actin cytoskeletal elements and cellular junction proteins 60 it is important to note there is relevance of this finding to covid-19 as studies on the pathology of severe coronavirus-induced ardsali hypothesize that alveolar damage is dependent on a balance between coagulation and fibrinolysin pathways 61 interestingly viral infection also appears to activate rhoa activity in some models 62 because one of the underlying features of ards secondary to covid-19 is the breakdown of the endothelial-epithelial barrier in the alveoli this activity could provide a potential avenue to reduce the influx of fluid into alveolar spacesan ancillary cytoskeletal rearrangement has also been observed following lmwf5a treatment of human retinal endothelial cells when treated these cells observe a rapid increase in acetylated -tubulin a modification associated with stabilization and longevity of polymerized microtubules fig 3a 24 this post-translational modification attributed to the release of ca2 from intracellular stores in this model can be detected in these cells in as little as 30 min post-treatment and persists for 24 h fig 3b 24 to put this in perspective destabilization of microtubules has been shown to be an integral endothelial barrier dysfunction as a result innate immune signaling and oxidative stress 63 moreover inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 resulting in the acetylation of -tubulin has been shown to reduce lps-induced lung injury by down regulating caspase 1 activity resulting in lowered il-1 levels 64 ergo microtubule stabilization has a documented anti-inflammatory and barrier enhancement effect in the lung
the potential biologic relevance of this lmwf5a activity can be seen in functional assays of barrier activity and in the microscopic examination of cytoskeletal rearrangements treatment of both endothelial and epithelial monolayers with da-dkp increases barrier function for extended periods of time as measured by increased trans endothelial electrical resistance moreover da-dkp also attenuates rapid increases in permeability promotes cortical f-actin rearrangement and reduces stress-fiber formation following thrombin stimulation of endothelial cells this activity is suggested to be dependent on epac1 an exchange factor for the aforementioned small gtpase rap-1 and ve-cadherin organization unpublished findings altogether these data on the molecular mechanisms and more general functional effects of lmwf5a demonstrate how this biologic may prove useful for the treatment of lung vasogenic edema by enhancing the alveolar-epithelial barrier via altering gtpase activity promoting cortical f-actin rearrangement and stabilizing the microtubule networkto explore the use of lmwf5a for this indication a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nebulized lmwf5a in adults with ards secondary to covid-19 infection supplement 1 was developed and is under review by the center for biologics evaluation and research division of the food and drug administration briefly this trial is designed to enroll up to ten 10 patients randomized 11 to nebulized lmwf5a plus standard of care soc for ards active arm n  5 or soc for ards control arm n  5 the primary trial objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of nebulized lmwf5a in patients with ards secondary to covid-19 infection the secondary trial objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of nebulized ampion versus control in improving the clinical course and outcomes of patients with ards secondary to covid-19 infection including mortality ventilator free days and pao2fio2 ratioif successful this therapy may attenuate the cytokine storm observed in these patients and potentially reduce mortality increase ventilation free days improve oxygenation parameters and consequently lessen the burden on patients and the intensive care unit this initial study will be followed by larger randomized controlled trial in covid-19 positive patients exhibiting respiratory distress and might avoid the need of mechanical ventilationin conclusion in vitro findings suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of lmwf5a make it a viable candidate for treating cytokine storm and restoring homeostasis to the immune response in covid-19at the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 first china and then the rest of the world have been confronted with an outbreak of a new airborne transmitted coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 a viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 just a few months later there are already millions infected worldwide and with borders closed and strict travel bans imposed local transmission patterns are in place in most countries 1 covid-19 mortality rate appears to be in the range of 34-55 2 which is significantly higher than that for seasonal flu caused by the influenza virus 1 but lower than for both severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 15 3 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 34 4 at the same time the covid-19 transmission rate is much greater than those of mers or sars and poses a real threat to life for a large number of people worldwide especially in older patients with other co-morbidities 5 thus in the absence of effective vaccines and treatments early detection and the ability to define prognostic parameters predicting the course of the disease appear to be of particular interestcoronaviruses represent a large family of zoonotic respiratory viruses 6 that can cause both seasonal cold symptoms and fatal respiratory failure associated with severe inflammation of lower respiratory tract 7 the major clinical symptoms of covid-19 are similar to those experienced during a seasonal flu infection and include fever dry cough headache myalgia and others co-morbidities such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes respiratory diseases hypertension and age may exacerbate the disease manifestations 89 both moderate and severe covid-19 infections cases may result in pneumonia with fluffy opacities on the chest computer tomographic scans lung edema and accumulation of pleural fluid in the lungs 10 11 severe cases require invasive oxygen supplythe exact molecular mechanisms of covid-19-mediated pathogenesis are still under investigation however the lessons learned from sars-cov and mers-cov infections may uncover some key features of covid-19-related pathologies as well as molecular mediators and signaling pathways involved the genetic sequence of sars-cov-2 12 which was released almost simultaneously with the first reported cases 10 revealed that it belongs to the coronavirus genus with 790 nucleotide identity to sarscov and 518 identity to mers-cov inoculation with sars-cov-2 of human airway epithelial cells in vitro causes cytopathic effects 10 and cessation of the cilium beating of epithelial cells similar to the cytopathic effect observed for sars-cov infection 13 the initial step in viral infection was revealed by the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 spike receptor binding domain 14 which just as sars-cov 15 binds to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the presence of ace2 on the cell membrane is crucial for virus virulence as hela cells lacking ace2 are resistant to sars-cov-2 infection 1617 structural analysis identified residues in the sars-cov-2 spike receptor binding domain that are critical for ace2 binding the majority of which either are highly conserved or share similar side chain properties with those of sars-cov these similarities in virus entry between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov correlate with detectable cross-neutralizing activity of serum from sars-cov-recovered patients 18 however no available monoclonal antibodies targeting sars-cov receptor binding domain were able to prevent sars-cov-2 infecting the cells highlighting unique intrinsic structure features of sars-cov-2 s-protein binding domain including a much higher binding affinity than that of sars-cov s-protein 19 in line with this more recent study reports that human recombinant soluble ace2 effectively but not completely prevents sars-cov-2 infection suggesting alternative mechanisms for viral entry 20surface molecule cd147 emmprin or basigin is being considered as one alternative pathway for the virus to enter the host cells since sars-cov-2 s-protein can bind cd147 as suggested by preliminary data 21 cd147 is expressed on hematopoietic cells including red blood cells epithelial and neuronal cells 22 basigin is viewed as the molecular gate for plasmodium pmalariae 23 not surprisingly cd147 is also associated with the hiv1 24 and sars-cov 25 infections in both cases viral protein binds to the cd147 in complex with cyclophilin a cypa sars-cov n-protein conjugates with cypa inside ace2-expressing infected host cells 25 with this modification newly assembled viral particles can infect cd147-positive cells however further studies are needed to evaluate possible impact of sars-cov-2 interaction with basigin in the context of covid-19ace2 crucial for sars-cov-2 virulence is expressed in the upper and the lower respiratory tract most remarkably on lung alveolar epithelial cells arterial and venous endothelial cells as well as enterocytes of the small intestine epithelial cells in the kidney ace2 expression is also detected in heart pancreas testis and brain 26 interestingly ace2 expression is not the highest in the upper respiratory tract 2726 once again supporting the hypothesis that increased transmissibility of sars-cov-2 as compared to sars-cov may be attributed to yet to be identified co-receptors or auxiliary factors adopted by sars-cov-2 28 also the fact that ace2 is widely expressed in other tissues and organs explains a broad spectrum of adverse effects not limited just to the lungs in addition it was shown that sars-cov-2 directly infects ace2-expressing tissue-resident cd169 macrophages in the spleens and lns causing lymph follicle depletion splenic nodule atrophy histiocyte hyperplasia and lymphocyte reduction 29 thus virus infection of macrophages firstly enhances viral spread and secondly triggers destructive events in the immune organs such as spleen and lns recent data from the experiments using sars-cov-2 capsid or live virus infection of cultured t cell lines mt-2 and a301 provides first evidence that sars-cov-2 could also infects t cells however expression level of ace2 on t cells is low and thus cd147 is considered to mediate sars-cov-2 entry into t cells 17after virus binds to ace2 fig 1
 serine protease tmprss2 cleaves the viral spike protein then another protease furin subsequently releases spike fusion peptide and the virus enters the host cell through an endosomal pathway 183031 following viral replication assembly and release the infected cells may undergo apoptosis or necrosis triggering the inflammatory response with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of macrophages and th1 cells as well as production of ifn il-17a il-21 and il-22 by neutrophils th17 and cd8 cells in turn sars-cov-2 infection of recruited immune cells may increase their apoptosis and exacerbate lymphocytosis 3233 and finally may lead in some patients to life-threatening conditions such as respiratory distress syndrome cytokine storm and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosiscovid-19 mortality is strongly associated with the development of severe respiratory distress syndrome which requires invasive ventilation it is important to identify those patients who are most likely to develop a severe form of the disease as early as possible based on the existing statistics a number of clinical predictors of the disease deterioration and mortality including the presence of secondary infections lymphopenia 34 comorbidities such as cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases diabetes hypertension obesity and cancer 35 increased cytokine production and serum ferritin 36 have been reported the other study showed that the elevated serum creatinine d-dimers lactate dehydrogenase c-reactive protein procalcitonin as well as increased white blood cell counts may indicate impending respiratory failure and the need for invasive oxygen supply 37 interestingly in recently published reports elevated interleukin-6 il-6 level was proposed as a relevant parameter predicting the unwanted course of the disease and the need for mechanical ventilation 38 39 40 these assumptions are consistent with data from a clinical trial in china that demonstrated on a small number of patients the efficacy of il-6 neutralization during exacerbation of covid-19 associated pneumonia 41 supplementary table 1il-6 is a cytokine with pleotropic functions ranging from hematopoiesis and metabolic regulation to inflammation autoimmunity and acute phase response il-6 modulates host defense through a number of immune stimulating mechanisms control of monocytes and their differentiation into macrophages 42 modulation of antigen-dependent b cell differentiation 43 increased igg production by b cells 44 and promotion of th2 response by inhibiting th1 polarization 45 several studies revealed strong correlation between il-6 levels in the serum and the upcoming respiratory failure 46 47 48 it was shown that even moderately elevated il-6 levels above 80 pgml were sufficient to identify covid-19 infected patients with a high risk of respiratory failure 37 moreover serum sars-cov-2 nucleic acid rnaaemia which is strongly associated with cytokine storm is closely correlated with extremely high il-6 serum levels 47 it was also suggested that serial measurement of circulating il-6 might be important in identifying disease progression or when evaluated immediately after covid-19 diagnosis confirmation may predict the upcoming respiratory failure or alternatively asymptomatic disease among sars-cov-2 infected patients 49therefore it would be valuable to explore the potential contribution of il-6 in the events occurring during sars-cov-2 infection the next section will discuss the mechanisms by which il-6 may possibly affect the disease exacerbation and the potential of therapeutic approaches based on anti-il-6 biologicsil-6 is one of the key proinflammatory cytokines during infection onset especially at the mucosal sites 50 however the impact of il-6 on the disease outcome may vary significantly fig 2
 on one hand il-6-dependent th17 activation and differentiation are important for effective neutrophil migration il-6 together with il-15 modulate cytolytic capacity of cd8 t cells 5152 and finally il-6 as a pyrogenic cytokine contributes to thermostatic regulation which is important for effective anti-viral response 5354 studies using il-6-deficient mice showed that il-6 ameliorates acute lung injury in influenza a virus iav infection 55 il-6-deficient mice infected with influenza virus exhibited higher lethality as well as increased weight loss and fibroblast accumulation in the lungs associated with virus-induced apoptosis of lung epithelial cells and neutrophils 56 indicating that il-6 may promote repair following virus-induced lung injury 57 finally early il-6 signaling promotes il-27-dependent maturation of treg cells in the lungs and resolution of viral immunopathology in mouse model of respiratory syncytial and influenza virus infection 58on the other hand il-6 has been implicated in the progression of viral infections in this regard il-6 synergizes with il-1b and tnf to upregulate trypsin expression which activates matrix metalloproteinases and causes the breakdown of basal membrane and extracellular matrix which in turn results in increased tissue permeability and edema 59 th1 cell-derived ifn is essential for effective antiviral immune response however il-6 may inhibit th1 polarization by stimulating cd4 cells to differentiate into th2 cells or by suppressing ifn expression 6061 moreover il-6 promotes th17 cell differentiation and il-17a secretion which in turn activates the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules such as bcl-xl favoring survival of virus-infected cells in the model of persistent viral infection 62 at the same time il-17 promotes the migration 63 and survival 64 of neutrophils which in turn contribute to the pathogenesis of covid-19-driven ards 65 finally in contrast to influenza virus infection il-6-deficient mice infected with murine pneumonia virus are characterized by better survival than wt mice with decreased lung edema and diminished neutrophil recruitment 66taking into account that in several experimental models of viral lung infections il-6 demonstrates either pathogenic 66 or protective 55 effects in vivo the role of this cytokine in sars-cov-2 infection should be carefully evaluated moreover the consequences of il-6 induction in covid-19 may vary depending on the infection stage and on the host immune statuspatients with the most severe outcome of sars-cov-2 displayed high serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines responsible for cytokine storm induction 3667 interestingly the majority of severe covid-19 cases with respiratory distress syndrome were associated with high systemic il-1b tnf and il-6 levels suggesting a direct connection between proinflammatory cytokine induction and adverse effects of covid-19 34 as sars-cov-2 shows 79 nucleotide identity to sars-cov major pathogenic mechanisms including cytokine storm and extensive lung damage during sars and covid-19 infection may be similar cytokine storm is a condition caused by extensive activation of the immune system and as a result extremely high production of cytokines and chemokines since cytokine storm can lead to multiple organ failure it is important to understand the mechanisms driving this conditionin lower respiratory tract sars-cov-2 infects predominantly type 2 alveolar epitheliocytes the cell type which does not participate in active gas exchange following replication and disengagement of the lung epithelial layer virus enters the underlying tissues and infects or is being captured by macrophages dendritic cells and neutrophils resulting in further viral spread 29 fig 3
 at the same time damaged epitheliocytes release danger molecules which drive the activation of lung epithelium and resident immune cells thus even at the early onset of viral infection its penetration of the mucosa to the epithelial layer activates the innate immune response adaptive immunity is also activated during covid-19 mainly by antigen presenting dendritic cells which produce large amounts of cytokines including il-6 il-1b and tnf and migrate to the regional lymph nodes to present viral antigen to nave t cells pushing their differentiation and migration into the affected tissue 68 specific humoral response represented by viral-specific antibody-producing b cells is also in place 69 replication of the virus results in further damage of affected organs together with self-boosting immune response manifesting to uncontrolled overexpression of inflammatory mediators in severe cases another mechanism driving cytokine storm during viral infections is increased blood vessel permeability which enables infiltration of effector cells producing additional amounts of inflammatory molecules and exacerbating hyper cytokine production 70 in addition leakiness of blood vessels allows virus to spread to other tissues and organs compromising their functions finally under persistence of inflammatory factors an increased number of inflammatory exudates and erythrocytes enter the alveoli resulting in lung damage and respiratory failure syndromeas mentioned above severe covid-19 induced pneumonia is marked by hyperactivation of the immune system and excessive production of il-6 3667 the main source of pathogenic il-6 appears to be myeloid cells as their number is significantly increased among pbmc 69 and in balf of severe covid-19 patients 71 myeloid cell recruitment and activation in the lungs is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in sars-cov mouse model 72 human primary macrophages and dendritic cells can be infected but they fail to support productive replication of sars-cov 7374 unlike alveocytes in which virus can replicate very quickly at the same time sars-cov and apparently sars-cov-2-infected macrophages demonstrate up-regulation of il-6 production and low expression of interferons 2973 interestingly patients requiring intensive care and invasive lung ventilation display negative correlation between il-6 tnf and il-1b concentrations and cd4 and cd8 t cell counts 75 confirming previous studies in animal models which suggested that cytokine storm actually dampens adaptive immunity against sars-cov infection 76 moreover production of ifn by cd4 t cells tended to be lower in severe as compared to moderate cases suggesting that sars-cov-2 infection induces lymphopenia with the suppression of antiviral ifn production 36 furthermore it has been suggested that this pathogenic il-6 is likely to be produced by highly inflammatory macrophages 71 but not by alveolar macrophages which are almost absent in the lung aspirates of severely affected patients 77 at the same time it should be noted that complete ablation of il-6 at the very early stages of viral infection may result in depressed tfh cell maturation and delayed antiviral antibody response 78it is known that acute inflammation and cytokine storm as its extreme manifestation can have a significant effect on hemodynamics and also on platelets and erythrocytes the dysregulated coagulation cascade and the subsequent formation of intra-alveolar or systemic fibrin clots are prominent findings in previous zoonotic coronavirus infections sars and mers orchestrated by crs 79 80 81 covid-19 patients also show significant changes in coagulative status ie low platelet count increased d-dimer fibrinogen levels and dysfunction of micro-vessels in pulmonary circulation 8283 thus thrombosis of the pulmonary capillaries is believed to contribute to rapidly developing hypoxia the role of il-6 in inflammatory hypercoagulation is controversial il-6 can increase the rate of fibrotic clot formation in whole blood but the effect is less pronounced than it is shown for il-1 or il-8 84 on the other hand il-6 is important for thrombus formation being a regulator of mmps and other thrombolysis-associated genes in macrophages 85other characteristic feature of cytokine release syndrome is change in iron homeostasis and hyperferritinemia as indicated by high levels of serum ferritin 86 in covid-19 patients ferritin elevation correlated with poor prognosis 36 as it was an indication of hemolytic events caused by hypercoagulation and hemophagocytosis in general inadequate macrophage activation leads to pathologic phagocytosis of erythrocytes and reutilization of heme iron using ferritin 87 in line with this high systemic ferritin may serve as an indicator of developing macrophage activation syndrome rather than a factor driving covid-19 pathogenesisanother key proinflammatory cytokine tnf is also released abundantly during cytokine storm caused by sars-cov-2 infection serum tnf levels were found to be elevated in severely affected covid-19 patients 34 previously it was shown for sars-cov that its spike protein is able to modulate tnf converting enzyme tace-dependent shedding of the ace2 ectodomain 88 tace expression is coupled to tnf production therefore it is hypothesized that the use of tnf inhibitors may also show some efficacy in preventing viral entry 89 as well as in decreasing immunopathology associated mortality as it was shown in preclinical studies in mice infected with severe respiratory syncytial virus 90 moreover anti-tnf therapy was effective in decreasing the il-6 and il-1b serum levels in lethal bacteremia suggesting that such treatment may provide complex anti-inflammatory effect 91 data obtained from covid-19 infected patients with inflammatory bowel diseases undergoing anti-tnf therapy support safety of such intervention in the context of sars-cov-2 treatment 9293 these findings argue for a potentially protective effect of tnf inhibition in covid-19 and further studies are needed to address this possibilityhypertension has been suggested as a risk factor for severe covid-19 outcomes 94 early data from the literature already assumed an association between blood pressure and circulating il-6 levels in otherwise healthy individuals 95 moreover several studies reported an increased il-6 expression in patients with hypertension 9697 il-6-transgenic mice characterized by elevated plasma il-6 levels displayed pulmonary hypertension 9899 taken together this data suggest that il-6 might be connected with increased risk of respiratory failure in hypertensive patients with covid-19one of the mechanisms regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance is angiotensin-renin system it is comprised of two pathways which are normally functioning in the state of dynamic equilibrium ace2-angiotensin iiangiotensin 1 receptor axis activating vasoconstriction and inflammatory response and ace2-angiotensin 17-mas receptor axis supporting vasodilation and suppression of inflammation fig 4
 a 100 changes in renin-angiotensin system activity are related to the pathogenesis of hypertension and of inflammatory lung diseases in particular acute lung injury caused by viral infections 15101sars-cov2 uses ace2 as an entry site thus reducing ace2 availability promoting an imbalance between the ace2-angiotensin iiangiotensin 1 receptor axis and the ace2- angiotensin 17-mas receptor axis 15102 in line with this recent studies have reported that covid-19 patients have increased angiotensin ii compared to healthy individuals 103 altogether the abovementioned data suggests that covid-19 infection leads to imbalanced angiotensin conversion and a shift towards pro-inflammatory signaling mediated by angiotensin 1 receptor axis 104 fig 4 bangiotensin ii is known to significantly increase the expression of il-6 in a dose-dependent manner 105 through pleiotropic activation of nf-kb transcription factors 106 107 angiotensin 1 receptor downstream activation of nadph oxidase results in elevated oxidative stress in particularly superoxide that activates transcriptional mechanisms that directly promotes il-6 gene expression in turn plasma il-6 concentrations correlate with blood pressure plasma angiotensin ii levels and vascular hypertrophy suggesting an important role of il-6 in the development and maintenance of hypertension specifically that mediated by angiotensin ii 108109 il-6 promotes angiotensin 1 receptor expression sensitizing the vascular wall to angiotensin ii-dependent signaling mechanisms activated cells can release cytokines including il-6 which promote expression of adhesion molecules and induce endothelial activation inflammatory cell infiltration and vascular inflammation 110 this further drives oxidative stress and il-6 expression therefore it is plausible that il-6 and angiotensin ii activate each other through a positive feedback mechanism in support of this hypothesis ace2 protects against lethal avian influenza a h5n1 infection 111 through prevention of oxidative stress and acute respiratory distress syndrome moreover it was recently reported that in covid-19 patients with hypertension angiotensin receptor blockade attenuated the inflammatory response possibly through il-6 inhibition 102112 taking together angiotensin ii accumulation due to sars-cov-2-mediated ace2 downregulation may cause angiotensin 1 receptor downstream activation of nadph oxidase which in turn leads to elevated ros production and to induction of transcriptional mechanisms that directly promote il-6 expression implicated in inflammation-induced injury and immunopathologychronic inflammation is the one common feature of hypertension diabetes obesity and age  the risk factors associated with covid-19 severe outcomes elderly obese and diabetic persons are affected by a low-grade chronic inflammation and are characterized by systemically increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines which may contribute to and facilitate the cytokine storm the main cause of covid-19 mortalityamong conditions predisposing patients infected with sars-cov-2 to severe outcomes diabetes is the most prominent it is estimated that mortality rate of those with covid-19 and diabetes is about 16 8 to 35 113 il-6 is known for its dual role in autoimmune diabetes as it is involved in the development of insulin resistance and -cell dysfunction and at the same time has anti-inflammatory effects and improves glucose metabolism 114 recent clinical data demonstrates significantly elevated systemic il-6 in covid-19 patients with diabetes as compared to those without diabetes 115 covid-19 may exacerbate the pre-existing diabetes since its entry site ace2 is expressed in the pancreas with a potential role in the development of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion 116 il-6 may be the link between diabetes and severe covid-19 outcomes through its ability to modulate t cell response some indirect evidence to support this comes from mouse studies of closely related mers-cov infection demonstrating that abnormal elevation of il-17a produced by il-6-dependent th17 cells exacerbates disease severity in diabetic mice 117 consistent with that finding patients with covid-19 have a higher proportion of th17 cells in the blood 118 suggesting that diabetics due to improper activation of th1 and th17 cells may have a compromised anti-viral immune response 31obese patients with covid-19 are more likely to develop severe respiratory distress syndrome 119120 just as diabetics obese patients have higher concentration of proinflammatory cytokines both in steady state 121 and apparently during covid-19 infection 8 in addition to decreased anti-viral t cell response enhanced il-6 production by adipose tissue in obese patients 122 may alter innate anti-viral immune response by neutrophils 121 and cause uncontrolled replication of the virus at the early stages of infectionfrom the very beginning of covid-19 pandemic age was identified as a risk factor 38 supporting the idea that ace2 may be a marker of cell senescence 123 myofibroblasts which increase in number with age express high levels of ace2 124 thus myofibroblasts are more susceptible to sars-cov-2 and elderly people bearing higher proportion of myofibroblasts might be more susceptible to covid-19 infection reviewed in 125 il-6 is a critical inflammatory regulator of senescence-associated secretory phenotype sasp 126 therefore il-6 overexpression may correlate both with senescent status of cells and tissues as well as with increased expression of ace2 in line with this idea hydroxychloroquine an anti-malaria drug which is now approved in some countries for covid-19 treatment effectively reduced the salivary and serum levels of il-6 in patients with sjorgens syndrome 127 moreover azithromycin prescribed together with hydroxychloroquine can target and selectively remove senescent cells 128 and thus provide anti-fibrotic activity by protecting the lungs from inflammation-induced injury 129130another issue facing elderly patients with covid-19 is a compromised activation status of their effector t cells these cells may display limited function during prolonged infection as a result of their exhaustion associated with the surface expression of such immune-inhibitory factors as pd-1 75 since aging itself is a process known to promote reorganization of the t cell landscape 131 and il-6 is a sasp predictor and regulator t cell exhaustion in the elderly patients with covid-19 is much more evident due to higher basal concentration of il-6 which can enhance the exhaustion process 132133smoking is another potential risk factor for sars-cov-2 infection smokers are more vulnerable to influenza virus infections 134135 and are more likely to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd 136 enhanced ace2 expression had been reported in the lungs of healthy smokers 137138 in line with that studies in mice have established that cigarette smoke can trigger the expansion of a subpopulation of respiratory epithelial cells that express ace2 in a dose-dependent manner 139 patients with copd as well as active smokers have increased ace2 expression in the lungs 140 which may potentially explain a fourfold increased risk of adverse development and severe outcome of covid-19 141142 taken together these recent reports suggest that smokers may be at higher risk of infection examination of factors predisposing to severe covid-19 in wuhan china revealed that 192 of patients with severe disease were smokers 143 on the other hand preliminary meta-analysis based on chinese patients suggest that active smoking was not associated with the severity of covid-19 144 indicating that impact of smoking on covid-19 progression is controversial and requires further assessmentintuitively patients with pre-existing asthma should display higher proportion of covid-19 severe cases however the prevalence of asthma in covid-19 patients in wuhan study was markedly lower 09 than that reported in the adult population of wuhan 64 143 one possible explanation is a shift toward th2-type immune response in asthmatics as opposed to th1-associated inflammatory response induced by sars-cov-2 infection 118 recent study reveals that tmrss2 expression in upper respiratory tract correlates positively with type 2 response genes especially with il-13 whereas ace2 expression is suppressed by il-13 considering low numbers of cells co-expressing these proteases in the upper respiratory tract it has been proposed that in the context of il-13-dependent reduction in ace2 expression allergy should promote resistance to infection 145 in line with this it was shown that ace2 expression is decreased in nasal and bronchial epithelium of allergic individuals following allergen challenge suggesting that asthma-associated immune response actually protects from covid-19-induced pathology 146 nevertheless further studies are required to reveal the impact of covid-19 severity in patients with preexisting asthmameta-analysis studies of covid-19 cases in china from december 2019 to february 2020 report lower incidence of the disease 147 and risk of death 35 in women than in men similar data on association of gender with poorer prognosis for males were obtained earlier for sars-cov 148 149 and mers-cov 150151 in connection to sars-cov-2 the x-linked ace2 gene is of a particular interest significant fraction of genes encoded on the x chromosome undergo dosage compensation however ace2 is located at xp22 ie the area in which genes may escape from x chromosome inactivation 152 possibly contributing to gender disparity in disease susceptibility gender differences in immune responses are known to depend not only on genetic but also on endocrine factors 153154 high doses of estradiol acting through estrogen receptors decrease production of proinflammatory cytokines via suppressing nf-kb signaling pathway 155 in relation to covid-19 the effects of estrogens on il-6 and on disease progression is of particular interest estrogen may suppress lps-mediated il-6 expression in mouse macrophages by both blocking of nf-kb activation 155156 and inhibiting p38 mapk phosphorylation 156 furthermore downregulation of il-6 expression in kupffer cells appears to be er-dependent 157 overall immunomodulatory effects of estrogens may contribute to decreased susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection in women and this question requires further studyone of the common complications from the respiratory viral infections including sars 158 and covid-19 159 is lung fibrosis this is characterized by alveolar epithelial cell injury recruitment and activation of fibroblasts and subsequent production of extracellular matrix ecm in the presence of specifically activated immune cells fibrosis develops as an exaggerated repair process following injury associated with abnormal immune response leading to chronic progressive disease 160 histological examination of lung biopsies from covid-19 patients show massive apoptosis of pneumocytes hyaline membrane formation fibromyxoid exudates 161 which are manifestations that are characteristic for ards and represent key events preceding development of fibrosis reviewed in 162 significant pro-fibrotic m2-like spp1macrophage infiltration was also described for covid-19 correlating with the disease severity 71 damage to the epithelial layer caused by the virus further attracts various immune cells participating in inflammation-repair balance monocytes macrophages granulocytes and t cells in addition some viral components such as n-protein and papain-like protease can directly stimulate production of tgf- one of the pro-fibrotic hallmarks in respiratory epithelium similar to what has previously been reported for sars-cov 163164the role of il-6 had been extensively studied in bleomycin model of lung fibrosis in mice bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic antibiotic which causes damage of tissues lacking bleomycin hydrolase predominantly in the lungs 165 mice with genetic ablation of il-6 were characterized by impaired fibrosis 166 however in the same model mice with pharmacological rather than genetic inhibition of il-6 demonstrated opposing phenotypes depending on the phase of inflammation-repair cycle specifically il-6 neutralization at the early inflammatory phase day 2 following bleomycin-induced lung injury resulted in apoptosis of pneumocytes which further contributed to pulmonary fibrosis whereas il-6 blockade at the early fibrotic stage day 8 following bleomycin-induced lung injury significantly ameliorated lung fibrosis 167 interestingly treatment of mice with recombinant soluble gp130fc at the late stage of chronic bleomycin model attenuated lung fibrosis emphasizing the importance of sil-6ra and il-6 trans-signaling in mediating this condition 168 it was further suggested that m2-like infiltrating macrophages are the major source of soluble il-6ra in fibrotic foci whereas pulmonary fibroblasts are the recipient cells which proliferate and produce extracellular matrix under trans-il-6 activation finally overexpression of il-6 in respiratory tract mediated by adenoviral vectors also resulted in the exacerbation of fibrosis and was associated with increased levels of m2-macrophages with pro-fibrotic features 169 these pro-fibrotic macrophages are also characterized by increased il-6ra expression 168 ace2 expression is reported for lung heart kidney intestine liver and brain thus similar fibrosis-associated complications should be expected not just for respiratory tract but also for other tissues and organs in correlation with viral load and severity of cytokine release syndrome summarizing the data available at the moment from infection-free experimental models of fibrosis one can conclude that il-6 may affect fibroblast proliferation and functions directly or through potentiation of a distinct macrophage phenotype taking into account the importance of this cytokine at the repair stage anti-il-6 therapy may prove beneficial not only in acute phase but also in subacute proliferative phase of covid-19-related ardssars-cov-2 tropism to neural system is of particular interest while neurological symptoms such as dizziness headache ataxia and anosmia are often found in mild covid-19 patients and develop early in the infection 170 ace2 expression in cns is attributed to the nuclei in brain stem and is associated with cardiorespiratory control 171172 recent study based on scrna sequencing suggests co-expression of ace2 and tmprss2 in olfactory epithelial cells but not in mature olfactory sensory neurons which were initially considered as the most obvious target population for the virus in cns 173 even without the understanding of the exact mechanisms of sars-cov-2 penetration and distribution in cns it should be noted that as a result of the disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and cytokine storm caused by infection blood-brain-barrier permeability is significantly increased which can lead to negative consequences for cns functioning 174175an effective therapeutic approach should include a combination of specific antiviral drugs which inhibit viral dissemination and limit direct virus-induced cytopathic effects coupled with anti-inflammatory therapeutics directed against immunopathology induced by a viral infection 176 sars-cov-2-induced immunopathology exhibits features of systemic hyper-inflammation reminiscent both of cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome and secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis 177 since overexpression of il-6 appears to be associated with severe covid-19 outcomes neutralizing antibodies used to treat a number of autoimmune diseases by targeting exacerbated inflammatory immune response of the host may provide a life-saving approach by preventing the cytokine release syndrome in line with that patients responding to cd19 car t cell therapy experience cytokine release syndrome 178 which is well managed by il-6 neutralizing antibodies 179 in a non-randomized open-label clinical trial 21 patients with severe or critical covid-19 were treated with a single dose of tocilizumab in addition to routine therapy 180 90 of patients recovered suggesting that anti-il-6 might be a powerful potential rescue therapy in managing acute respiratory distress syndrome of covid-19 and inhibiting the most adverse outcome peripheral mononuclear cell scrna-seq profiling data obtained from these patients indicate that treatment with tocilizumab does not reduce the number of cytotoxic cd8 and plasma b cells thus does not interfere with robust adaptive immune response 69 preliminary data from 21 patients with covid-19 who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and participated in a compassionate-use program at papa giovanni xxiii hospital in bergamo italy indicate that intravenous introduction of siltuximab reduced c-reactive protein level in all patients and significantly improved clinical conditions with a reduced need for ventilation in 33 of patients 43 of patients showed stabilization of their conditions and 24 of patients experienced a worsening of the disease and required intubation 181sarilumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by inhibiting the il-6 pathway through binding and blocking the il-6 receptor recently another clinical trial was initiated which will evaluate the effects of sarilumab in patients with severe covid-19 this us-based multi-center double-blind phase 23 trial will begin at medical centers in new york and is anticipated to enroll up to 400 patients 182the overview of initiated clinical trials of anti-il-6 therapeutics in covid-19 patients is presented in supplementary table 1 in summary strong scientific evidence of the beneficial impact of il-6 inhibitors in the modulation of the covid-19 infection requires further clinical datain the face of a pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide the need to develop new approaches or reassess the existing ones in the treatment of severe viral infections is more pressing than ever despite the fact that humanity experienced viral infections causing deadly pneumonia twice in the past 20 years there are still no drugs specific for coronaviruses the evidence discussed in this review suggests that for patients with risk factors especially those with high systemic levels of il-6 clinically approved neutralizing antibodies against il-6 or its receptor il-6r in combination with standard treatment protocols may provide benefit gaining a deeper understanding of the factors that affect the immune response and mechanistic link of these factors to disease severity is crucial for effective clinical management of covid-19 in severely affected patientsthis work was supported by the ministry of science and higher education of the russian federation grant 075-15-2019-1660the authors declare that there is no conflict of interestthe novel coronavirus infectious disease covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 first broke out in wuhan china in early december 2019 and subsequently quickly spread worldwide over 7700000 confirmed cases as of 6142020 1 following purification and sequencing analysis in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sars-cov-2 is suggested to be closely related to two bat-derived sars-like coronaviruses with 88 genomic homology and sars-cov approximately 79 identity homology and more remotely from the middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov approximately 50 identity 2 during the sars outbreak in 2003 sars-cov infected over 8000 people with 916 death cases in 29 countries 3 these data suggested that sars-cov-2 possesses a much stronger contingency compared with sars-cov with an estimated basic reproductive number r0 value indicating as viral infectivity of 228 4 on 30 january 2020 the who declared that covid-19 outbreak had become a pandemic public health emergency of international concern rapidly rising number of covid-19 cases with a high mortality rate makes it rather challenging for timely and tightly control of the disease up-to-date no antiviral drug or vaccine has been approved for sars-cov-2 infection which can directly target sars-cov-2based on clinical manifestation nearly all sars-cov-2-infected patients develop some degree of pneumonia and patients with severe conditions develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards respiratory failure caused by severe lung injury is perhaps the main cause of death in sars-cov-2-infected patients the sars-cov-2 viral load from patient respiratory tracts is believed to be positively linked to lung disease severity 5 according to the analysis of clinical features of 138 patients infected with sars-cov-2 common symptoms associated with covid-19 include fever 986 dry cough 594 and fatigue 696 6 except for respiratory symptoms many patients have cardiac symptoms including palpitation and chest tightness and severe acute cardiovascular injury 7 in addition covid-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular issues coronary heart disease hypertension displayed more severe clinical outcomes and higher mortalities 7 these clinical findings indicated pronounced cardiovascular sequelae for sars-cov-2 infection here we will summarize the relationship between sars-cov-2 and cardiovascular diseases and discuss possible mechanisms of action behind sars-cov-2 infection-induced damage to cardiovascular systemprevious studies have depicted a close relationship between cardiovascular diseases and sars or mers patients with sars-cov often suffer from a wide variety of cardiovascular complications including hypotension 504 tachycardia 719 bradycardia 149 reversible cardiomegaly 107 and transient atrial fibrillation 8 meta-analysis including 637 cases suggested high prevalence of hypertension approximately 50 and heart diseases 30 in patients with mers 9 given that covid-19 shares many aspects of pathogenesis and clinical symptoms reminiscent of sars and mers cardiovascular complications might also occur in patients with covid-19 unlike sars-cov which tends to infect the young population the susceptible groups for covid-19 are believed to be middle-aged and elderly with preexisting comorbidities the median age is 56 year-old in patients infected with sars-cov-2 6 not surprisingly this is an age when many chronic comorbidities start to develop including myocarditis heart failure cardiomyopathy arrhythmia hypertension and diabetes mellitus the overall association between covid-19 and cardiovascular abnormities is summarized in table 1
 particular forms of cardiovascular complications or aggravation of preexisting cardiovascular conditions in covid-19 patients are discussed in detail heremyocardial injury characterized by elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers results from myocardial ischemia and non-ischemic causes including myocarditis 10 several studies have noted acute myocardial injury in patients with covid-19 among one of the initial 41 cases of covid-19 in wuhan 6 patients 15 had cardiovascular diseases and hypertension and 5 12 developed acute myocardial injury which were mainly manifested as follows 1 cardiac biomarkers hypersensitive cardiac troponin i  99th percentile upper reference limit or 2 new abnormalities in electrocardiogram or echocardiogram 7 in addition 4 out of 5 patients with cardiac injury received intensive care unit icu care indicating the importance of myocardial injury in poor prognosis of covid-19 in addition to acute myocardial injury covid-19 patients admitted to icu displayed a significantly higher systolic blood pressure compared with those non-icu patients 7 in another multi-centered study involving 1099 covid-19 cases with preexisting anomalies including diabetes 74 hypertension 15 coronary heart disease 25 and cerebrovascular disease 14 increased level of creatine kinase  200 ul in patients in severe condition accounted for a much higher percentage than non-severe patients 190 versus 125 11 in 138 hospitalized covid-19 patients acute cardiac injury was observed in 10 patients 72 among which majority of patients required icu care 80 icu versus 20 non-icu p  0001 6 in a meta-analysis involving 1527 patients from 6 independent studies incidences of cardiocerebrovascular disease hypertension and diabetes were 164 171 and 97 respectively in covid-19 patients 12 moreover prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases was much higher in icu patients compared with non-icu patients this study also revealed presence of acute cardiac injury in  8 patients infected with sars-cov-2 of which incidence in icu cases was approximately 13 folds higher than non-icu cases 12 these findings indicated that patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases are more sensitive to sars-cov-2 infection and patients with covid-19 combined with cardiovascular diseases might be associated with a higher icu rate and mortalityone burning issue remains uncertain is whether sars-cov-2 would lead to long-term damage in cardiovascular system however a 12-year follow-up of 25 recovered sars patients suggested that patients had several cardiovascular and metabolic disorders including cardiovascular abnormalities 44 hyperlipidemia 68 and abnormal glucose metabolism 60 13 the precise mechanism of sars-induced disturbed metabolism of glucose and lipid still remains elusive during a 10-year follow-up of 591 patients with pneumonia 206 349 had cardiovascular events including life-threatening coronary heart disease myocardial infarction and stroke 14 hospitalization for pneumonia is deemed closely related to risks of short-term and long-term cardiovascular diseases furthermore the administration of corticosteroids in severe pneumonia patients to avoid immunopathological lung injury increases overall adverse cardiovascular disease sequelae 13 15 given that sars-cov shares similar structure and genomic identity with sars-cov-2 patients with covid-19 should be expected to develop chronic cardiovascular damage thus special attention is needed for the clinical preservation of cardiovascular functionearlier studies have demonstrated the occurrence of myocarditis in patients with mers using cardiac magnetic resonance 16 limited covid-19 autopsy cases have revealed substantial interstitial infiltration of proinflammatory mononuclear cells in heart tissues validating presence of myocardial inflammation and injury with sars-cov-2 infection 17 recently tavazzi and colleagues reported the first case with sars-cov-2 viral particles in the heart and cardiomyocyte necrosis using endomyocardial biopsy these data suggested that heart can be directly infected with sars-cov-2 18 several cases of myocarditis were reported after sars-cov-2 infection 19 20 in a 53-year-old covid-19 patient admitted to icu for systolic dysfunction myocarditis was confirmed as evidenced by 1 increased levels of n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide nt-probnp and cardiac biomarkers creatine kinase-mb high-sensitivity troponin t and 2 diffused biventricular hypokinesis and interstitial edema and circumferential pericardial effusion using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 19 in an analysis of 68 fatal cases with covid-19 5 patients 7 were found with fatal fulminant myocarditis in combination with circulatory failure and 22 fatalities 33 were attributed to both myocarditis and respiratory failure 21 unfortunately specifics of incidence rate of myocarditis in covid-19 patients have not been reported in any large-scale studies the occurrence of myocarditis in covid-19 patients may be attributable to direct localization of sars-cov-2 in myocardium and systemic inflammatory responseaccording to a cohort of 137 covid-19 cases in hubei province 10 patients 73 presented heart palpitations as early symptom 22 among 138 hospitalized patients with covid-19 167 developed cardiac arrhythmia with much more prevalent cases in icu 444 in icu versus 69 in non-icu p  0001 6 du and colleagues reported that arrhythmia occurred in 51 of 85 fatal cases of covid-19 from wuhan and 2 patients died of malignant arrhythmias 23 however none of these studies were able to discern the specific nature of arrhythmias in covid-19 in another study involving 187 patients confirmed with covid-19 infection malignant life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation were noted in 11 patients 59 24 moreover patients with elevated troponin t experienced higher risk of ventricular arrhythmias 173 in high troponin t group versus 15 in normal troponin t group p  0001 in addition to acquired arrhythmia patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes including long and short qt syndrome brugada syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia are believed to be more susceptible to pro-arrhythmic effects of sars-cov-2 such as stress fever use of antiviral drugs and electrolyte disturbance 25cardiac arrest triggered sudden death appears to be a common cause of death of patients with covid-19 in 85 fatal cases of covid-19 cardiac arrest is the direct cause of death of 7 patients 23 in a recent study including 99 cases of covid-19 the first fatality case was a 61-year-old man who developed heart failure respiratory failure and sudden cardiac arrest 26 some critically ill covid-19 patients developed fatal cardiac arrest on transplantation or immediately upon admission to icu 27 survival of severe covid-19 patients who underwent an in-hospital cardiac arrest is generally considered rather poor 28 nonetheless no direct evidence for cardiac arrest is present as a complication of covid-19several studies have noted the occurrence of cardiomyopathy in patients with covid-19 among 21 critically ill patients with covid-19 cardiomyopathy developed in 7 333 patients 29 meanwhile in a single-centered observational study 8 of 187 patients with confirmed covid-19 had preexisting cardiomyopathy although little follow evaluation was performed on the covid-19 outcome in these patients 24 it is noteworthy that a number of medications employed in covid-19 may also lead to cardiomyopathy including chloroquine interferon and bevacizumab 30 heart failure is a common complication of covid-19 due to deterioration of preexisting cardiac dysfunction and newly developed cardiomyopathy and myocarditis in a multi-centered cohort study involving 191 covid-19 patients heart failure was noted in 23 of patients and more prevalent in non-survivor patients compared with survivors 52 versus 12 p  00001 31 heart failure is characterized by decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and drastically elevated nt-probnp guo and colleagues reported patients with elevated troponin t have a higher level of cardiac biomarkers and nt-probnp 24 moreover a tight correlation was identified between nt-probnp and troponin t levels indicating that patients with myocardial injury are at higher risks of cardiac dysfunction or heart failure 24 although covid-19 patients often display comorbidities affecting cardiac diastolic function including diabetes obesity and hypertension few studies have revealed a relationship between heart failure with preserved ejection fraction hfpef and covid-19 sinkey and colleagues reported that hfpef was developed in a postpartum patient with covid-19 and preeclampsia 32 notably loss of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the receptor for sars-cov-2 increases the proinflammatory macrophage phenotype in the heart from patients with hfpef 33 further study is warranted to explore the precise interplay between sars-cov-2 and hfpef heart failure in covid-19 patients is attributable to myocardial injury systemic inflammatory response pulmonary hypertension and ards renal dysfunction retention of water and sodium and imbalance of myocardial oxygen demand and supplyalthough little direct evidence is readily available for the incidence rate of cardiogenic shock in patients infected with sars-cov-2 cardiogenic shock was demonstrated a severe complication of covid-19 in a 69-year-old patient with confirmed covid-19 elevated inflammatory markers and increased hypersensitive troponin i were noted prior to the development of severe cardiogenic shock 18 cardiogenic shock may be mixed with other types of shock following sars-cov-2 infection such as septic shock in a study involving 138 cases with covid-19 shock was confirmed in 87 of patients and was more common in patients admitted to icu compared with those non-icu patients 306 versus 10 p  0001 6 however subtypes of shock were not reported in this study notably circulatory and respiratory support with extracorporeal membranous oxygenation ecmo should be considered in covid-19 patients with cardiogenic shockabnormal coagulation parameters d-dimer fibrin degradation products prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were noted in patients with covid-19 in particular elevated levels of d-dimer and fibrin degradation products were suggested to be closely linked with poor prognosis 31 34 in a multi-centered retrospective cohort study an elevated level of d-dimer  1gl was tightly tied with in-hospital mortality of covid-19 even in multivariate analysis 31 thromboembolic anomalies and coagulopathy including venous thromboembolism pulmonary embolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation dic are believed to be highly prevalent in covid-19 patients for example a mass of pulmonary embolism was noted in covid-19 patients and the prevalence of pulmonary embolism was twice higher in icu covid-19 as all icu or influenza icu patients 35 36 another independent report noted 714 incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation dic in non-survivors accompanied with coagulation abnormalities in terminal covid-19 cases 31 high prevalence of coagulation abnormalities in covid-19 may be attributable to vascular inflammation and endothelial defect as sars-cov-2 can directly attack endothelial cells expressing high levels of ace2 in addition sars-cov-2 virus has been noted within endothelial cells and infiltration of proinflammatory cells contributing to the onset and development of endothelial dysfunction and defective coagulation 37 at this point optimal thromboembolic prophylactic therapy has not been well established for covid-19 patients however interactions between antiviral drugs for sars-cov-2 and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants should be considered 38ample evidence has suggested that ace2 functions as a target receptor for sars-cov-2 ace2 is known to be a membrane-bound aminopeptidase mainly in hearts lungs intestines and kidneys 39 organ distribution of ace2 seems to be closely related to the clinical sequelae of covid-19 figure 1
 it is noteworthy that sars-cov-2 possesses a 10-fold greater affinity for ace2 than that of sars-cov making it a much more potent virus ace2 is distinct from angiotensin-converting enzyme ace in that it lacks cleavage for dipeptidases but only single peptidases and is not subject to inhibition by ace inhibitors ace2 level was upregulated in diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases including heart failure and ischemic cardiomyopathy 40 41 42 given that sars-cov-2 is a substrate for ace2 patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases with elevated ace2 levels are thus more susceptible to sars-cov-2 and presented a poor prognosis ace2 is reported to counter angiotensin ii ang ii from raas in cardiovascular diseases binding of sars-cov-2 to ace2 prevents the enzyme from converting ang ii to ang 1-7 potentiating ang ii-induced biological effect to worsen pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes nave ace2 is known to offer an array of cardiovascular benefits including anti-inflammation anti-fibrosis anti-oxidation and vasodilation 43 this is supported by the findings that ace2 knockout provoked ang ii accumulation and compromised cardiac contractile function 44 murine models and human autopsy samples revealed that pulmonary infection of sars-cov leads to downregulated cardiac and pulmonary ace2 signaling favoring proinflammatory response and acute respiratory failure 45 in this context overt cardiovascular injuries in covid-19 patients may also result from loss of ace2-mediated cardiovascular protection figure 1 meanwhile approaches targeting ace2 downstream signaling may help alleviate pulmonary and cardiovascular injury ang 1-7 has been shown to protect against cardiac and pulmonary injury through suppressing alveolar cell apoptosis alleviating alveolar cell activation and exerting anti-fibrotic anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effects this is consistent with its utility in a clinical trial on ards patients 42 46 47 48 thus these favorable effects of ang 1-7 should demonstrate the therapeutic potential to counter organ pathologies in patients infected with sars-cov-2 increment of ang 1-7 levels may be of significant clinical value in the prevention against cardiovascular and lung injury in the face of sars-cov-2 infection 48the following scheme is believed the modality for viral entry and replication the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 recognizes ace2 on cell surface and binds with ace2 to allow viral entry into cells to release viral particles viral rna is translated using the host ribosomes viral proteins are then packaged in the golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum before release of virus here recognition and binding of spike protein and ace2 are considered the most critical process for viral entry and replication and may be facilitated and interrupted by ace2 and ace2 neutralizing antibody respectively 49 a number of maneuvers are speculated to counter ace2-mediated multi-organ dysfunction including cardiovascular complications in the face of sars-cov-2 infection 39 including 1 spike glycoprotein-based vaccine 2 ace2 receptor blockade 3 delivering excessive soluble ace2 to neutralize sars-cov-2 virus and 4 suppression of transmembrane protease serine 2 among which spike protein priming seems crucial for interaction with ace2 50administration of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas inhibitors including ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker arb are known to upregulate ace2 which is expected to promote sars-cov-2 entry and aggravation of lung and cardiovascular injury in covid-19 patients nonetheless other studies suggested that raas inhibitors may rather enhance the pulmonary protective role of ace2 and alleviate inflammatory response and cytokine release in sars-cov-2 or other viral infection 51 52 53 as for cardiovascular system raas inhibitors may benefit cardiovascular function through direct inhibition of ang ii production or indirect inhibition of ang ii through upregulation of ace2 figure 1 in a multi-centered study involving 1128 covid-19 patients combined with hypertension administration of ace inhibitors or arbs was associated with a lower mortality rate 37 in aceiarb groups versus 98 in non-aceiarb group p  001 54 in another study involving 362 patients with hypertension hospitalized for covid-19 there was no difference in severe infections and mortality rate during hospitalization between patients treated with and without ace inhibitors or arbs 55 according to the statement of the european society of hypertension treatment with ace inhibitors and arb should be encouraged in patients with stable covid-19 or at risk for sars-cov-2 infection 56 despite that it remains controversial whether raas inhibitors should be administrated to covid-19 patients with existing cardiovascular diseasesclinical observation noted that covid-19 patients exhibit signs of overt cytokine storm profound immune and inflammatory responses reminiscent of those seen in pesticide paraquat toxicity 
figure 2
 covid-19 patients with cytokine storm are likely to develop multiple organ failure mof and sudden death which greatly worsen the overall survival in covid-19 patients 57 cytokine storm syndrome as often seen in paraquat toxicity denotes a severe life-threatening condition manifested by a sharp rise in proinflammatory cytokines overwhelming inflammation hyperferritinemia hemodynamic instability and mof and is potentially fatal if untreated 57 the hallmark of cytokine storm is an uncontrolled and dysfunctional immune response involving continued activation of lymphocytes macrophages and natural killer cells 58 these cells release abundant pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferon ifn- tumor necrosis factor tnf- interleukin il-1 il-6 il-18 il-7 and il-10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ifn- inducible protein 10 ip-10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1- which cheat more immune cells to form a positive feedback cycle causing a cytokine storm cytokine storm has attracted more attention as it directly correlates with covid-19 mortality in the severe stage of the disease patients with covid-19 mostly develop ards mof with heavy involvement of cytokine storms 57in terms of proinflammatory mediators sars-cov-2 shows remarkable similarities to sars-cov an outbreak of sars-cov in 2003 revealed markedly high inf- il-1 il-6 il-10 and il-12 polymorphonuclear neutrophil pmn chemokines il-8 mcp-1 and ip-10 were also elevated 59 patients infected with sars-cov-2 showed similar elevations of ifn- il-1 ip-10 and mcp-1 7 inf- from natural killer cells assists mature dendritic cells to release more interferon and macrophage activation il-1 is an early response cytokine generated by inflammasomes to provoke b and t cell proliferation epithelial cell activation and vascular leakage 58 59 il-6 contributes to pulmonary inflammation and fever in addition to its known effect in cardiac remodeling and injury 60 under cytokine storm reactive oxygen species ros accumulate to trigger apoptosis of cells within the infected area as well as degradation of extra-cellular matrices ros production in the face of cytokine storm moves the immune response from a protective to a pre-injury state 61 il-10 produced by th2 cells serves as a negative feedback cue to counteract secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines it was noted that sars-cov-2 infection did upregulate th2 cells as well which improves overall cytokine balance and mitigates hyperinflammatory state induced by cytokine storm 7 when the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators is thrown off immune response can become harmful 58 patients with cytokine storm present high fever enlarged spleen an accessory lymphoid organ excessive bleeding and anemia due to vascular malfunction due to tissue destruction and inadequate blood flow patients start to develop organ failure the aforementioned cytokines and inflammatory mediators are also capable of activating capillary endothelial cells thus rising capillary permeability for cellular migration although such mechanism is meant to deliver immune cells quickly to the site of infection it also provokes fluid buildup within lungs resulting in poor oxygen transport and hypoxemia as seen in sars-cov-2 infection 16 recently a newly discovered multisystem inflammatory syndrome was observed in a 14-year-old teenager with covid-19 showing resemblance to kawasaki disease an inflammatory disease in infants and toddlers 62 the syndrome mainly impairs the cardiovascular system and manifests as severe heart failure and cardiogenic shock accompanied with extracardiovascular symptoms including fever lymphadenectasis rash on hands and feet and stomachache 62 the pathophysiology of the syndrome cannot be comprehensively explained currently but steroids administrated to the patient seem to be effective further study should be conducted to figure out this inflammatory syndromeit is noteworthy that increased levels of ang ii caused by sars-cov-2 infection may play a role in the immune response and inflammatory damage in covid-19 patients while classical raas is responsible for the maintenance of blood pressure and hemostasis immune cells possess several ang ii-related intracellular actions in parallel with raas 63 1 ang ii activates the proinflammatory mediator nf-b which promotes monocytes to produce chemoattractant proteins such as mcp-1 il-6 and tnf- for immune cell recruitment and initiation of cytokine storm in covid-19 patients 7 63 64 2 ang ii may stimulate production of adhesion molecules such as vcam-1 and icam-1 to recruit immune cells including dendritic cells and t lymphocytes 65 upon binding with ang ii dendritic cells with both ang ii receptors exhibit high levels of maturation and migration 63 3 ang ii causes profound ros production serving as proinflammatory mediators to provoke damage of surrounding tissues endothelial activation vascular leakage and immune cell recruitment 63 vascular damage from oxidative stress is well perceived in atherosclerosis hypertension and other cardiovascular pathologies 64 worsening oxidative damage to the vasculature is a major contributor for unfavorable cardiovascular outcomes in covid-19 patients ang ii-evoked oxidative damage proinflammatory stimulation and immune cell recruitment collectively underscore the global pathological outcomes for sars-cov-2 encompassing stroke cardiac pulmonary vascular and kidney injuries 7 63 64 66 such scenario may likely explain towards why patients with preexisting pathologies involving raas system such as hypertension chronic heart failure and diabetes mellitus fair worse outcomes from covid-19 insults 7 29 66 it is possible that these patients may be hit much harder by the covid-19 virus due to an upregulation of ace2 receptors which would ease viral entry and preexisting systemic inflammation and cardiovascular dysregulation by excitement of the parallel raas signaling within immune cellsdue to inflammation and lung injury sars and mers patients can develop hypoxemia or low circulating oxygen levels 6 16 30 as delineated earlier an acute attack on respiratory system provokes damage within vasculature and tissues tissue breakdown and vascular leakage dampen the ability of heart and lungs to perfuse properly leading to hypoxemia dyspnea or shortness of breath all of these events contribute to myocardial defect including arrhythmia and shock 6 mers patients presented pneumonia accompanied by shortness of breath and left sided chest pain further diagnostics revealed myocardial edema and acute myocardial injury due to viral infection rather than ischemic injury 16 according to a study involving 41 patients confirmed with covid-19 32 of patients developed various degree of hypoxemia and required oxygen therapy 7 due to severe pulmonary damage hypoxemia is believed to cause the reduced energy supply of cardiomyocyte leading to intracellular acidosis and ros to destroy the cell membrane 12 in addition influx of calcium ions can be induced by hypoxemia and cause apoptosis and injury of cardiomyocytes 12 although not all hypoxemic patients will require intense therapy such as ventilation a burning concern for many health organizations is how to properly manage a large number of severely hypoxemic sars-cov-2 patients with only limited ventilators 67 of course an alternate option for the treatment of hypoxemia is ecmo at the university of minnesota medical center a sars-cov-2 patient arrived with profound signs of dyspnea and severe hypoxemia and was successfully treated with 12 days of ecmo followed by decannulation 68 likewise ecmo was successfully applied in many sars-cov-2 cases in china although more in depth scrutiny is warranted to better fine the use of ecmo in the treatment of ards from sars-cov-2cardiovascular toxicities of several anti-sars-cov-2 drugs are listed in table 2
 at this point antiviral drug-induced cardiovascular toxicity in the covid-19 treatment should not be ignored antiviral drugs including ifn- ribavirin chloroquine phosphate lopinavirritonavir arbidol and remdesivir have all been included in the treatment of covid-19 69 several antiviral drugs exert cardiotoxicity or elicit interactions with other cardiovascular medications for instance lopinavirritonavir may lead to a prolongation of pr and qt intervals and influence serum levels of antiplatelet drugs through cyp3a4 inhibition 30 70 remdesivir previously administrated to patients with ebola viral infection is used clinically in covid-19 patients during ebola outbreak one patient among a total of 175 patients administrated with loading dose of remdesivir developed severe hypotension and sudden cardiac arrest 71 in systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis therapy cardiotoxity including cardiac arrhythmias dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy decreased myocardial function vasodilation and hypotension is often noted with frequent administration of chloroquine 72 73 in addition chloroquine affects beta-receptor blockers through inhibition of cyp2d6 30 therefore blood pressure and heart rate must be closely monitored when co-administration of -blockers and chloroquine in covid-19 patientsother than aforementioned mainstream mechanisms for covid-19-induced defects in cardiovascular system a number of additional scenarios should not be underestimated for example psychological stress is deemed a possible contributing factor that sars-cov-2 may lead to cardiovascular damage sars-cov-2 infection especially those with severe infection is obviously an acute stress for patients with sars-cov-2 infection stress contributes to the activation of autonomic nervous system increases in blood pressure and heart rate disorders in thrombus and coronary vasoconstriction 74 75 moreover stress may promote platelet aggregation compromise vascular endothelial function and promote the risk of ischemia and thrombosis 74 to this end covid-19 patients undergoing psychological stress process are at a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases including hypertension cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial ischemiainfarction
table 2 demonstrates several medications used in sars-cov-2 infection sars-cov-2 has proven to be in the same lineage of coronavirus as sars-cov and mers-cov with 80 genetic compatibility to sars-cov 76 77 the binding domain of the sars-cov-2 protein spike with ace2 is distinct from that of the sars-cov protein spike even though the spikes themselves have 76 compatibility medications targeting such protein spike may not share the same efficacy against both viruses 78 on the other hand rna-dependent rna polymerase proteins rdrp of sars-cov-2 have 96 compatibility with those of sars-cov 78 medications which successfully targeted this polymerase in sars-cov are likely effective for sars-cov-2 remdesivir was one of these medications and showed some promises although inconsistently to inhibit sars-cov-2 infection in vitro and is suspected to manage covid-19 symptoms 17 77 ribavirin another rdrp inhibitor also displays efficacy against sars-cov-2 although it is limited by an intrinsic viral protein nsp14-exon which can cleave the drug out of the rna chain prior to reaching the rdrp 78an alternative to these antiviral drugs is chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine common anti-malarial agent that blocks viral entry through endosomal modifications modulation of inflammatory mediators and alterations to ace2 79 nonetheless conflicting data have seen with regards to the efficacy of these medications in the treatment of sars-cov-2 in addition to valid concerns on chloroquine toxicity 80 81 one other therapy that may have a similar mechanism of action is ammonium chloride an acidotic agent which inhibits sars-cov viral growth in vitro this medication also exhibited alterations to the ace2 receptor potentially reducing viral ability to bind 79 ammonium chloride has limited uses in clinical treatment and is poorly examined making it a major concern for treatment in vulnerable patients 81other options which are being explored this time include lopinavirritonavir which act synergistically via hiv protease inhibition and metabolic inhibition to lengthen drug half-life 81 while the mechanism in sars-cov-2 is not clear this medication may reduce viral titers and lower risk of death based on previous mers-cov and sars-cov studies 82 83 use in sars-cov-2 patients has had unconvincing results showing no mortality benefit and minimal symptom improvement 84 nitazoxanide an enzyme inhibitor utilized in anaerobic infections inhibited viral growth of sars-cov-2 in vitro and may be a viable candidate 17 81 more research is being conducted on this therapy 18adjunctive treatments that may benefit sars-cov-2 patients include il-1 which has shown in vitro efficacy in mers-cov along with lopinavirritonavir 82 risks may outweigh benefits as both thrombocytopenia and worsened patient outcomes have been shown as a result of this medication 82 in severely ill patients corticosteroids have shown mixed benefits and risks 5 85 if used appropriately corticosteroids could help reduce damage from the cytokine storm in severely ill patients 85 caution should be used with these medications as adverse effects can occur often 85 a more promising therapy involves upregulation of the ace2 receptor through the use of ang ii receptor blockers such as losartan 86 this medication may potentiate the pulmonary protective effects of ace2 by preventing excess production of ang ii when produced at high levels these molecules can lead to severe vasoconstriction and activation of endothelial cells potentiating the lung damage seen in sars-cov-2 53 86 a last resort which has shown promise in sars-cov-2 patients is convalescent plasma taken from recovered patients this plasma includes neutralizing antibodies which can target and help take down the active virus in a new patient though data is limited potential mortality and symptom benefits have been shown in recent sars-cov-2 patients 25 87the covid-19 pandemic has impacted millions of patients and posed a tremendous threat to human health cardiovascular comorbidities including pre-existing cardiovascular diseases and new-onset cardiovascular abnormalities are prevalent in patients with sars-cov-2 infection and these patients are at a higher risk of severe disease and mortality covid-19 is closely associated to a series of cardiovascular sequelae including acute and chronic myocardial injury myopericarditis arrhythmia cardiac arrest cardiomyopathy heart failure and cardiogenic shock these represent possible mechanisms underscoring the sars-cov-2-induced cardiovascular diseases further understanding of interactions among ace2 protein raas inhibitors and sars-cov-2 should be of great significance for patients with cardiovascular diseases and covid-19 besides cytokine storm syndrome and immune dysfunction are also important causes of multiple organ failure including cardiovascular dysfunction and critical condition of patients with covid-19 a number of promising antiviral drugs and vaccines are under investigation but none has been proved to be clinical efficient to date clinical physicians should pay attention to the cardiovascular toxicity of medications used in covid-19 patients in addition the therapeutic challenges posed by coexist of covid-19 and cardiovascular diseases need to be adequately studiedlw amo hp yb dm-s and jr were involved in manuscript drafting and editingnone of the authors has any conflict of interest to declarecoronaviruses appear periodically and unpredictably from year 2002 with the onset of sars-cov and then with mers-cov and now with covid-19 sars-cov-2this family of viruses causing infectious diseases and they became a constant threat to human health there is no definitive and approved treatment for cardiorespiratory sequels of these cov infections although from a pathophysiological point of view there is a deep understanding of the immune response to the virus there is no approved treatment for immunomodulation in these patients thus it seems that treatment of immune system problems such as systemic pulmonary inflammatory responses associated with cov is necessitating immunity based treatment can be a good alternative and savior therapy to some antiviral treatment as we know cytokine storms in lung tissue in most deadly events in patients with cov infection therefore in cases of cov induced pneumonia it is important to control cytokine production and inflammatory response although this strategy is challenging due to a lack of clear immune response and endangering the host defense it does not seem impossible in an attempt to address these issues from a therapeutic perspective we describe our hypothesis about one of the most challenging theories of immunotherapy in cov virusesfig 1
fig 2
hypothesisreplication of rna viruses such as the cov family is accompanied by excessive production of interferons neutrophils and macrophages which brings about a massive immune response referred to as cytokine storm this overproduction negatively affects the balance of the inflammatory responses and the normal function of cytokines
this immune system disorder can lead to series of symptoms including fever edema and hypotension in mild cases in severe cases it can cause systemic inflammation heart failure pulmonary failure which consequently led acute respiratory syndrome and eventually death in covid-19 infection like other coronavirus infections a similar scenario is expected with varying degrees of immune interferenceit is expected that the management of the activity and performance of the cytokines might lead to the prevention of severe endothelial dysfunctions and pulmonary fibrosis in patients affected by covid-19 previous studies have demonstrated the indicated impressive relation between the nervous system and immune system these studies demonstrated that nervous system has modulatory effects on the production of multiple inflammatory cytokines in lung tissue 1 2the cholinergic pathway via acetylcholine neurotransmitters can interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors further activation of these receptors can apply a suppressive effect on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 3 figure-1 among the nicotine receptor subtypes the subunit 7-7 is the most prominent due to its high expression in immune cells b cells macrophages t cells and target cells and its association with humoral and intrinsic immunity therefore evaluation of pharmacological approaches to activate -7nachr for inhibition of immunologic phenomenon such as cytokine storm can be helpful nicotine is a non-selective agonist of this receptor that mimics acetylcholine binding to stimulate vagal activity and decrease cytokine function and block the inflammatory pathway the general algorithm of this idea was illustrated in figure-2 hence comprehension of this theory can provide better therapeutic guidance for the treatment of coronavirus infections especially covid-19we describe one of the trends in the decline of the cytokine storm it seems that lethality and uncontrolled complications of coronaviruses are due to the lack of control of the cytokine storms although the pathogenesis of coronaviruses is complex and requires specific treatment previous studies have shown the efficacy of neutralizing anti-inflammatory cytokines in inflammatory conditions caused by covid-19 1 dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effects of the 7nachr-1 agonist have been demonstrated and previous studies have shown that activation of this receptor can have an anti-inflammatory role and immune cells regulating 4 nicotine is agonist of mentioned receptor but cannot be used clinically due to its toxicity addictive nature and lack of specificity other agonists of 7nachr-1 receptors in this group such as gts-21 produce the same nicotine effects without nicotine problems also some studies have reported limited use of gts-21 in the clinical phase and have shown that this agent can cause a decrease of cytokine levels and significantly reduced inflammatory biomarker after infection 3 5 it has been thought that a nicotine agonist compound like gts-21 is able to suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines during infection of covid-19 in fact these nicotine agonists can control allergic inflammation induced by innate immune and cellular immune pathways taken together according to mentioned literature review it can be concluded that gts-21 as potent 7nachr-1 receptor agonist will act as an anti-inflammatory agent against covid-19- infection-induced cytokine storm and inflammatory disturbances in respiratory system and reduced the risk of death in infected subjectssevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1 has emerged recently as a new challenge for the medical sciences although coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 primarily causes respiratory disease its pathogenesis is still poorly understood covid-19 was considered a pandemic by the world health organization on march 11 2020 because it was widely spread around the globe and presented a high rate of human-to-human transmission it has been reported that covid-19 progression involves initial symptoms of mild chills and a dry cough followed by fever fatigue and shortness of breath with dyspnea and in more severe cases hypoxemia with oxygen saturation under 852 several signs and symptoms presented by patients with covid-19 have been described from asymptomatic patients with a mild cold to important changes in clinical and laboratory examinations which can progress to severe organ failure and death the changes observed include decreased total lymphocytes prolonged prothrombin time elevated lactate dehydrogenase cellular immune deficiency coagulation activation myocardial hepatic and renal injury 3 4 and endotheliitis in the lung heart and small bowel 5 6

although the mechanisms involved in these changes are not known observation by the naked eye of the lungs of patients with sars-cov-2 showed pathological characteristics of exudative proteinaceous lesion while microscopic examination showed inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrates 7 biopsy and post-mortem studies show diffuse alveolar damage with the formation of hyaline membranes mononuclear cells and macrophages infiltrating the air spaces and diffuse thickening of the alveolar wall in addition spleen atrophy hilar lymph node necrosis focal hemorrhage in the kidney and enlarged liver with inflammatory cell infiltration constitute considerable worsening during the disease 2 8 some patients have poor outcomes in covid-19 that mostly correlates with clinical and laboratory features of a cytokine storm moreover hypercoagulation and hypoxia in multiple organs are the worst scenario oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species ros is related to all the main changes observed in other inflammatory and infectious diseases and could be the connecting point that unites all these events our study focused on the hosts response to viral infection emphasizing oxidative stress rather than the viruss mechanisms of aggressionmany studies have related the cytokine storm to the deterioration in the patients condition with covid-19 infection and it is considered a major factor in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction 2 9 10 11 12 13 14 a previous study demonstrated that influenza infection induced expression of cytokines via activation of pattern recognition receptors including the toll-like receptors tlr3 tlr7 and tlr8 retinoic acid-inducible gene i and the nod-like receptor family members in lung epithelial cells macrophages and dendritic cells 4 15 it is possible that the innate immune response in covid-19 infection follows the same pathways the inflammasome is an important element in the cytokine storm 16 and studies have shown that ros is a potent ligand and direct mediator for triggering nlrp3 nod-like receptors p3 inflammasome additionally tlr and nlr ligands enhanced nfb driven transcriptional levels of nlrp3 nfb in turn is activated by ros thus direct or indirectly inflammasome is increased by ros 17 18 19 besides ros h2o2 mainly activates nfb to produce inflammatory cytokines 20 21 hyperproduction of il-6 tnf il-1 interferon-gamma inducible protein 10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor monocyte chemoattractant macrophage inflammatory proteins 1- and elevated blood ferritin are also observed in covid-19 patients 16 similar to influenza infection covid-19 infection appears to have an initial pulmonary phase that consists of virus replication and inflammation with the involvement of ros as a direct and indirect nlrp3 inflammasome activator and subsequent blood dissemination possibly associated with the adaptive immune response to oxidative stress as a mechanism of systemic injury it is important to understand the mechanism by which sars-cov-2 induces pulmonary and systemic injury and whether the virus is solely responsible or whether there are other synergistic mechanisms that sustain and aggravate the tissue damage observed in this diseaseduring the disease progression patients with covid-19 show disseminated intravascular coagulopathy characterized by prominent elevation of fibrinfibrinogen degradation products d-dimer 12 13 23 which can translocate to extravascular space and damage the cells in the tissue 24
hematological disorders have also been reported as inflammation biomarkers for hemoglobin levels a meta-analysis study of 1210 covid-19 patients showed significant lower hemoglobin levels of 71 gl or even 59 gl in severe cases 24 in another study besides presenting decreased hemoglobin patients with coronavirus pneumonia presented elevated serum ferritin erythrocyte sedimentation rate lactate dehydrogenase activity and acidosis 16 in addition to the inflammation markers the disseminated intravascular coagulation contributes to the establishment of organ failure due to hypoxia 25 26 treatment of 27 coronavirus patients with heparin promoted recovery in all of them 27 contributing to the proposal of a treatment protocol to be applied to hospitalized patients another observation made about patients with severe covid-19 progression is that they developed typical clinical manifestations of shock characteristic of the evolution to viral sepsis 4 it has been shown that free hemoglobin and heme is augmented in the blood of patients with sepsis due to hemolysis 23 although several mechanisms involved in hemolysis have been described in viruses infections there are a number of studies showing that ros play a role in damaging the membrane of erythrocytes 23 28 the production of high ros levels in septic patients leads to alterations in the erythrocyte membrane that in turn induces phagocytosis in macrophages and neutrophils perpetuating a cycle with further production of ros 29 this may contribute to increased free hemoglobin and low levels of oxygen transport to the tissues 29 30 free hemoglobin is dissociated generating heme which then is degraded by heme oxygenase oh-1 to produce free iron both heme and free iron are harmful to cells 30 a murine study of a sepsis model by cecal ligation and puncture clp showed increased total body free iron up to three times higher when compared to the control 31 in addition administration of apoferritin ferritin that is not combined with iron and the induction of the expression of ferritin heavy chain decreases clp mice mortality 32 reduced oxygen saturation leads to superoxide radical and h2o2 generation by mitochondria 33 34 35 superoxide anion radical reduces iron iii to iron ii which in the presence of h2o2 also generated by phagocytic cells in the inflammatory environment produces hydroxyl radicals oh an extremally toxic agent that promotes the formation of cell membrane lipid peroxides and protein oxidation triggering cell death by apoptosis andor necrosis 36 it has also been demonstrated that iron iii induces blood coagulation 37 via hydroxyl radicals hydroxyl radicals convert soluble plasma fibrinogen into abnormal fibrin clots in the form of dense matted deposits resistant to enzymatic degradation 37 38we believe that once started all these events occur independent of the causative agent worsening the patients conditiondisseminated intravascular coagulopathy sepsis and decreased oxygen transport to the tissues are some of the main elements presented by covid-19 patients 22 moreover free heme in the blood decreases circulating nitric oxide no further worsening the ischemia of the organs 24 39 40 despite hypoxemia pulmonary compliance is preserved 27 indicating a possible mitochondrial impairment mitochondrial inability to produce atp 41 has been described in experimental and human sepsis in normal oxygen saturation and tension this points to mitochondria dysfunction as a crucial role for sepsis pathogenesis 41 the impairment of mitochondria leads to cytopathic hypoxia 40 41 42 that results in oxygen partial reduction with ros generation and reduced energy productionin this regard hypoxia that accompanies sepsis is known to generate superoxide h2o2 and other reactive species mainly by the mitochondrial respiratory chain 40 41 43 44 hydrogen peroxide triggers the expression of many genes that upregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 and tnf and inducible nitric oxide synthase inos via activation of the nfb pathway 20 21 22 in a cyclic manner these pro-inflammatory cytokines activate macrophages neutrophils endothelium cells via nadph oxidase nox to produce more superoxide and h2o2
20 further superoxide radical reacts with no produced by inos that is expressed via the nfb pathway yielding peroxynitrite both peroxynitrite and no are toxic to mitochondria 44 this may explain the inability of the mitochondria to utilize oxygen despite normal tissue oxygen saturation 41 this interplay between ros and cytokines generates a self-sustaining cycle between cytokine storm and oxidative stress production that eventually leads to multiorgan failure in patients with covid-19 who progress to sepsis and shockseveral in vitro and in vivo studies have highlighted the strategy of some viruses to alter the redox balance of a cell in order to survive initiation of oxidative stress by virus infection was shown to play a key role in the activation of innate immunity via nfb generation of cytokines to fight off pathogenic microbes 45 46 47 48 respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection has been shown to induce ros production that in turn induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and innate immune defense 49 50 51 additionally several viruses induce oxidative stress in order to facilitate their replication inside the cell 52 as a way to control ros levels these viruses have evolved to acquire the ability to manipulate the nrf2 pathway in their favor 52 53 54 in some cases viruses have the ability to suppress the nrf2 pathway 54 55 for instance rsv increases lipid peroxidation and decreases gsh in human alveolar type ii-like epithelial cells and small airway epithelial cells and abrogate the activation of the nrf2 pathway resulting in a reduction in the expression of nrf2 target genes including hemoxigenase-1 ho-1 superoxide dismutase 1 sod1 superoxide dismutase 3 sod3 glutathione s-transferase gst catalase cat and glutathione peroxidase gpx 54 at the same time the toll-like receptor and interferon ifn pathways are triggered by infection-induced oxidative stress to combat the virus infection 56 57 on other hand defective redox balance by a host cell has been shown to contribute to viral pathogenesis resulting in massive induction of cell death provoked by oxidative stress 58 influenza virus was shown to induce apoptosis and cytotoxicity in alveolar epithelial cells that were accompanied by increased expression of caspase 1 and 3 and a proinflammatory cytokine il-8 59 this virus induces oxidative stress but at the same time facilitates the nuclear translocation of nrf2 with subsequent expression of ho-1 a protective enzyme against oxidative injury in the human alveolar epithelial cells 59 these findings confirm the idea that oxidative stress is importantly involved in the success or failure of the response to virus infectionshaping a therapy for a disease whose pathogeny is unclear is a challenge if oxidative stress is believed to be the link of every mechanism known for sars-cov-2 infection the use of antioxidants such as vitamin e sh group donor n-acetyl cysteine iron complexing agents deferoxamine inhibitors of nfb activators of nrf2 curcumin resveratrol and the use of specific pro-inflammatory cytokine inhibitors and anticoagulants could help the recovery of patients with covid-19it is useful to emphasize that there are clinical and experimental studies showing the effectiveness of antioxidants in the treatment of many diseases an in vitro sepsis model showed that vitamin e  tocopherol trolox soluble vitamin e and motvit e a polar derivative reduced mitochondrial damagedysfunction nfb transcription molecule and cytokine expression motvit e which accumulates inside mitochondria had a more efficient protective effect on genes linked to tlrs 60 the treatment of animals with vitamin e in the model of acute sepsis also showed beneficial effects 61triterpenoids oltipraz butylated hydroxyanisol sulphoraphane and dimethyl fumarate curcumin silibinin resveratrol exert their antioxidant activity by activating nrf-2 and inhibiting nfb pathways 62 high levels of blood peroxynitrite in 18 patients with sepsis were decreased using deferoxamine an iron chelator used in patients with iron overload 29 this indicates the potential application of this drug in iron complexing and peroxynitrite scavenging in patients with sepsisglutathione gsh is the main antioxidant agent in mammalians and it is the most important antioxidant defense in the lungs 64 when the balance between gshgssg is disrupted by an increase in h2o2 a more oxidative environment oxidizes proteins that control the activation and localization of transcription factors such as keap-1 which regulates nrf-2 and ib which regulates nfb 45 thereby sh group donors activators of nrf2 and nfkb inhibitors through their regulator molecules keap-1 and ib respectively are potential therapeutic options for sars-cov-2 infection a case report shows that this strategy successfully reverted the severe symptoms of covid-19 patients 65 lipoic acid also a sh donor was used in a randomized study and reduced the mortality rate from 778 to 375 66certainly a different approach is on the table one where we seek new drug strategies directly targeting the host response to viral aggression rather than the sars-cov-2 virus in which antioxidants can exert their action by breaking the cytokine storm oxidative stress cycle decreasing hematological damage and reducing cytopathic hypoxiait appears that oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of covid-19 perpetuates the cytokine storm cycle blood clotting mechanism and exacerbates hypoxia taken together this evidence indicates an important participation of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of viral infection in all direct tissue injury including mitochondrial dysfunction and in the signaling of the processfurther it indicates an interplay between oxidative stress and the cytokine storm as a mechanism that sustains and worsens the tissue injury which terminates in hypoxia and organ failure moreover it reveals that the sars-cov-2 virus may interfere with the equilibrium between the nfb transcription molecule involved in the expression of cytokines and nrf2 activation responsible for the expression of antioxidant enzymes yet to be proved conclusively we are aware of the importance of the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of viral infection and sepsis however its participation in covid-19 disease remains unclear 63 we believe that there is crosstalk between the cytokine storm and oxidative stress this crosstalk may play an important role in the severity of symptoms presented by patients with covid-19 infection thus it is reasonable to propose a pathogenesis model of coronavirus syndrome with primary lung injury and late hematological tissue hypoxemia cytopathic hypoxemia and mitochondrial dysfunction due to the involvement of oxidative stress which is supported by robust experimental evidence presented by the scientific literature thereby we aim to contribute to a rational therapeutic decisionthe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest in the elaboration of this paperthe authors declare that no funding was involved in the elaboration of this papercoronaviruses covs mainly targeting human respiratory system are responsible for health-threatening outbreaks including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and lastly coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 1 in december 2019 in the chinese province of wuhan the novel coronavirus has been identified in patients with atypical pneumonia characterized by fever dry cough and progressive dyspnea 2 rapidly this coronavirus namely sars-cov-211world health organization 2020 naming the coronavirus disease covid-19 and the virus that causes it online website httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019technical-guidancenaming-the-coronavirus-disease-covid-2019-andthe-virus-that-causes-it accessed 28 march 2020 has spread worldwide leading to a serious lung inflammation acute respiratory distress syndrome ards cardiac and renal injury especially in patients with older age and comorbidities diabetes mellitus hypertension and heart failure 35 according to disease progression patients may be roughly divided into two groups asymptomatic or mild cases that usually recover and severe cases approximately 15 that develop multi organ failure primarily respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit icu admission 4 5 an efficient immune response against sars-cov-2 may be considered fundamental for the resolution of covid-19 however some studies have shown a significant relationship between the disease severity and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and subsets of immune cells 67 it has been suggested that during the response to sars-cov-2 the immune dysregulation and the high level of proinflammatory cytokines could be the main cause of tissue injury eventually the exact pathophysiologic mechanism of covid-19 remains still largely unknowncovs belong to big family coronaviridae which consists of two subfamilies orthocoronavirinae and torovirinae on the basis of genomic and phylogenetic relationship the subfamily orthocoronavirinae is classified into four genera alphacoronaviruses betacoronaviruses gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses 8 the alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses tend to infect mammals and cause respiratory and gastrointestinal infection in humans like sars coronavirus sars-cov mers coronavirus mers-cov and sars-cov-2 while gammacoranaviruses and deltacoronaviruses have the ability to infect birds in addition to mammals 29 the betacoronaviruses comprise of sars-cov mers-cov human coronaviruses hcovs bat-sars-like sl coronaviruses and lastly identified sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 possesses nonsegmented single-stranded positive-sense rna ssrna with 5-cap structure and 3-poly-a tail which is a typical genomic structure of covs 10 the genome analyses have revealed that the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 is 96 and 795 identical to the bat coronavirus termed batcov ratg13 and sars-cov respectively 2therefore the bat has been suggested as a natural host of sars-cov-2 and the transmission route of sars-cov-2 could be through unknown intermediate hosts the genetic analyses of sars-cov-2 genomes from 103 chinese patients demonstrated that this virus has been evolved into two main types l type 70 and s type 30  l type is more aggressive and infectious than s type which is the ancestral version11the genome of cov contains six major open reading frames ofrs and numerous accessory genes first ofrs ofr1ab which encompasses the two-third of viral rna encode two large proteins of covs polyprotein 1a pp1a and pp1ab these polyproteins are divided into 16 nonstructural proteins nsps responsible for viral rna replication and transcription by virally encoded chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro or main protease mpro and papain-like protease plpro 1213 the remaining ofrs on the one-third of the genome encode major structural proteins including spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins all of which are crucial for the viral infectivity as seen in figure covs possess a lipid bilayer envelope with s m and e proteins 1415 the n protein is composed of an amino n-terminal nt domain and acarboxy c-terminal cytoplasmic tail ct domain and located in the core of the viral particle both domains bind to viral rna to form the helical nucleocapsid 1617 besides sars-cov n protein acts as an antagonist to the interferon pathway by regulating the signaling and synthesis of type i interferon ifn which is one of the most important response in the innate immunity to viral infection 18 the m protein is the most abundant component of the viral envelope the m protein contains a glycosylated nt ectodomain three transmembrane tm domains and a ct domain that binds to the nucleocapsid the m protein gives the shape of the virus and promotes the membrane curvature and the virus assembly by interacting with the s protein and the ribonucleoprotein 141920 the e protein is a small integral membrane protein including an nt ectodomain a tm domain and a ct endodomain the e protein facilitates the assembly the budding and the envelope formation as well as the m protein 21 moreover the e protein has an ion-channel activity contributing factor of the inflammasome activation the animal study has shown that blocking the ion channel activity of sars-cov e protein by deletion of associated genes leads to the reduction of the edema and the level of inflammasome-activated interleukin il-1 il-6 and tumor necrosis factor tnf all of which have an important role in the progression of ards 22the s glycoproteins on the surface of covs are the receptor binding proteins which are responsible for the attachment to host cells viral-host cell membrane fusion and the internalization of the virus 14 s genome of sars-cov-2 has less than 75 identical sequence with previously known sars-covs except for ratg13 which of s genome is 931 identical with sars-cov-2 2 besides another genome analyses have elucidated that the sequence identity of s protein between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov is 76 and most variation has been seen at the n terminus 2324the s glycoprotein consists of two domains s1 domain which includes receptor-binding domain rbd interacting with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 on the human host cells as sars-cov and s2 domain which mediates virus-cell membrane fusion and viral entry 225 the s2 domain comprises of three parts a large ectodomain a single tm domain and a ct domain 26 the sequence of rbd from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 exhibits 735 identity 24 the current study has indicated that the rbd of sars-cov-2 has lower affinity to ace2 than the rbd of sars-cov 27 however the result of the another study revealed that sars-cov2- s protein binds ace2 with higher affinity than sars-cov 28 after attachment of sars-cov-2 with s protein to ace2 on the host cells s protein is cleaved by host cell proteases to reveal the s2 domain for viral-host membrane fusion and viral entry which is coupled with tnf- production 10 29 30 the effective antiviral responses of the host innate and adaptive immunity including the production of various proinflammatory cytokines the activation of t cells cd4 and cd8 t cells are essential for controlling the viral replication limiting the spread of virus inflammation and cleaning the infected cells 3132 nevertheless the tissue injury caused by the virus could induce the exaggerated production of proinflammatory cytokines the recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages and granulocytes this results in the cytokine storm cs termed as a macrophage activation syndrome mas or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh thus leading to further tissue damage 3335 data obtained from sars-cov-2 infected patients have shown that severe cases may be characterized by a cytokine storm inexorably progressing to ards 3638 several features of covid-19 such as the cytokine profile serological markers and clinical symptoms resemble shlh most commonly triggered by viral infection 6 34 furthermore another important evidence is that the severity of covid-19 is related to the level of the proinflammatory cytokines and subsets of immune cells 639covid-19 possesses different levels of various cytokines and chemokines through the mild to severe stage of the disease in sars-cov-2 infected patients the retrospective analysis has demonstrated that initial plasma levels of il-1 il-1ra il-7 il-8 il-10 ifn- monocyte chemoattractant peptide mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein mip-1a mip-1b granulocyte-colonystimulating factor g-csf and tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf- are increased in patients with covid-19 the further analysis has shown that the plasma concentrations of il-2 il-7 il-17 il-10 mcp-1 mip-1a and tnf- in icu patients are higher than non-icu patients 36 moreover the plasma levels of il-2 il-6 il-8 il-10 and tnf- observed in severe infection are prominently greater than those in nonsevere infection 37 few retrospective studies have revealed that the lung injury reported with murray score is strongly associated with the level of il-1 il-1ra il-2 il-7 il-10 il-17 ifn- inducible interferon protein ip-10 g-csf and mcp-3 and these cytokines and chemokines excluding mcp-3 are positively related to sars-cov-2 viral load22liu y zhang c huang f yang y wang f et al 2020 2019novel coronavirus 2019-ncov infections trigger an exaggerated
cytokine response aggravating lung injury online website httpchinaxivorgabs20200200018 accessed 01 april 20207 the plasma level of il-6 considered as a significant cytokine contributing to mas increases both in mild and severe patient groups of covid-19 severe patients have a significantly higher level of il-6 than mild or nonsevere patients 6373840 furthermore based on the assessment of pulmonary infiltration in patients with ards the large area of lung injury 50 is closely correlated with the increased level of il-6 and the subgroup of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood 41during the infection both innate and adaptive immune cells synergistically participate in the anti-viral response 42the important increment in the number of neutrophils leukocytes and the neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio nlr has been observed in severe covid-19 compared to mild cases the prominent lymphopenia indicating an impairment of immune system develops in most covid-19 patients especially in severe ones 437 therefore it seems that neutrophils and leukocytes might reinforce the cs other than lymphocytes in covid-19the level of lymphocytes and subsets of t cells which play a significant role in the balancing of immune response varies according to the type of the virus due to possible viral pathologic mechanism previous investigations have elicited that the total count of lymphocytes and the subset of t cells are reduced in patients with sars-cov infection 4344 data from recent studies have suggested that sars-cov-2 infection can lead to immune dysregulation through affecting the subsets of t cells the significant alleviation of t cells is observed in covid-19 and more pronounced in severe cases in patients with covid-19 the level of helper t cells cd3 cd4 and cytotoxic suppressor t cells cd3 cd8 and regulatory t cells are below normal level while helper t cells and regulatory t cells in severe patients are remarkably lower than nonsevere patients regulatory t cells are responsible for the maintenance of the immune homeostasis with suppressing the activation proliferation and proinflammatory function of most lymphocytes including cd4 t cells cd8 t cells nk cells and b cells 4546 furthermore the percentage of nave helper t cells amplifies while the percentage of memory helper t cells and cd28 cytotoxic suppressor t cells decreases in severe covid-19 6 37 the equilibrium between the nave t cells and memory t cells is fundamental for mediating the efficient immune response 47 in addition to t cells the reduction of b cells and nk cells are seen in covid-19 another important result is the confirmed strong relationship between inflammatory markers including esr crp and il-6 and the subset of lymphocytes 39 however previously it has been shown that there is no significant correlation between il-6 and subsets of lymphocytes 6 although these reports have indicated that cd4cd8 t cell ratio in sars-cov-2 infection is similar to the healthy group the increase in this ratio and the decline of cd8 t cells and b cells are considered as a poor predictor for the assessment of post-treatment clinical follow-up 6 39 taken together these results indicate that sars-cov-2 is responsible for an immune dysregulation with the induction of aberrant cytokine and chemokine response alteration in level of the subgroup of lymphocytes all of which might result in cytokine storm and further tissue damageexcessive inflammatory response with features of cytokine storm cause severe disease course and worsens the prognosis in covid-19 undoubtedly definitive and most effective treatments for covid-19 drugs would be the antiviral agents that directly target sars-cov-2 considering the lack of proven antiviral agents and hyperinflammation caused by virus antiinflammatory drugs used in daily rheumatology practice may constitute possible treatment options in treatment of covid-19 following antiinflammatory treatments are potential candidates for covid-19 with their preclinical or limited clinical evidence systemic corticosteroids have broad-spectrum actions on the immune system that may suppress the exuberant systemic inflammatory response that occurs in ards severe multi-source systemic inflammation is associated with adverse outcomes so one may think that corticosteroids may of benefit with their broad spectrum immunosuppressive effects however evidence has shown that use of corticosteroids delayed viral clearance in sars and mers infections similarly they increased secondary infection rates mortality and complications of steroid therapy in survivors of influenza pneumonitis 48 in a randomized controlled trial that included 16 non-icu sars patients early 7 days of illness hydrocortisone therapy was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load therefore corticosteroids should not be used early phases of disease unless there is a clear indication for their use 49 in sars infection some patients showed severe inflammatory features despite reductions in viral load with subsequent seroconversion suggestive of exuberant immune response independent of viral load 50 in two small observational study use of corticosteroids did not show a survival benefit in covid-19 patients even increased mortality rates when used in high doses 5153 moreover corticosteroid use was prolonged sars-cov-2 rna shedding as observed in sars and mers infections 54 in the light of preliminary data corticosteroids are more likely to function on inflammation-mediated lung injury and interstitial fibrosis at late-stage of ards 52 however the dose duration and timing of corticosteroids must be individualized considering risk-benefit ratio until results of ongoing well-designed prospective cohort studies obtained at present several studies are registered to assess the efficacy of corticosteroids in covid-19 chloroquine cq and hydroxychloroquine hcq are 4-aminoquinoline derivatives that are approved by the us food and drug administration fda for the treatment of malaria systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis ra and decades of experience in use of these disorders they are also used in q fever and porphyria cutanea tarda hcq has a better side effect profile than cq and is strongly recommended for the long-term treatment of lupus unless the occurrence of a severe side effect hcq does not increase the risk of infections and has lipid-lowering antithrombotic and antineoplastic properties 55 in adult rheumatic diseases the recommended dosage is 200 to 400 mg 155 to 310 mg base with a cut off of 65 mgkgdaily is usually well-tolerated the most dreaded complication is retinal toxicity which rarely occurs in long term use five or more years elders with kidney failure or tamoxifen users have an increased risk of retinal toxicity cq and hcq may prolong qt interval which does not require routine ecg monitorization in recommended doses at higher doses these drugs have a potential risk of fatal arrhythmia or if combined with qt prolonging medications as well as those with cardiac diseases 56 other acute notable toxicities of 4-aminoquinoline derivatives are allergic reactions and neuropsychiatric events 57 very rarely they may cause cardiomyopathy which is thought to occur due to lysosomal accumulation with their chronic use 58oral absorption of cq and hcq are very good and are excreted primarily by urine the half-lives of cq and hcq are prolonged ranging between 40 and 50 days and have a large volume of distribution which allows for sustained sequestration in the tissues tissue concentrations may differ with being highest in the lung tissue about 30-fold of plasma concentrations as shown in animal models 59it has been known that cq and hcq have antiviral activity including hepatitis b hiv h1n1 and zika virus 60 antiviral activity of hcq was first observed in hiv and the hepatitis b infections in the early 1980s small studies showed its favorable efficacy in combination regimens of hbv hcv and hiv infections cq and hcq are thought to exert antiviral activity via multiple mechanisms first these agents interfere with glycosylation and proteolytic maturation of proteins by interfering with terminal glycosylation of ace2 the cellular receptor for s protein both agents block virus-receptor binding and cell entry 61 62 second cq and hcq both are weak bases and concentrated in acidic low-ph organelles such as endosomes golgi vesicles and lysosomes increasing their ph 61 endosomal acidification is required for the activation of endosomal proteases responsible for the initiation of coronavirusendosome fusion that releases viral particles into the infected cells 63 therefore cq and hcq inhibit viral release into the host cell by blocking endosomal acidification third hcq inhibits protein glycosylation and proteolytic maturation of viral proteins budding of the sars-cov occurs in the golgi apparatus and results in the incorporation of the envelope spike glycoprotein into the virion 64 studies have shown a resulting accumulation of noninfective viral particles of hiv or an inability of viral particles to bud out of the host cell reducing spread of infection finally antimalarial drugs act as protecting hemoglobin against invasion by malaria parasites with their effects on heme metabolism there is abnormal heme metabolism in covid-19 patients chloroquine phosphate competes with the porphyrin and binds to the viral protein thereby inhibits the viral proteins attack on heme or binding to the porphyrin according to a study cq could prevent orf1ab orf3a and orf10 to attack the heme to form the porphyrin and inhibit the binding of orf8 and surface glycoproteins to porphyrins to a certain extent33liu w li h 2020 covid-19 disease orf8 and surface glycoprotein inhibit heme metabolism by binding to porphyrin

bybindingtoporphyrin119381733 accessed 04 april 2020 in rheumatic diseases the exact mechanism of action of hcq and effects on the immune system are largely unknown however beside interfering with lysosomal activity and autophagy as mentioned above cq and hcq interact with membrane stability and alter signaling pathways and transcriptional activity which can result in inhibition of cytokine production and modulation of certain costimulatory molecules both drugs inhibit antigen presentation in dendritic cells cytokine production in macrophages and calcium toll-like receptor tlr and cgas-sting signaling in b t and other immune cells 55 65 the major proposed immunomodulatory mechanisms of cq and hcq are the following inhibition of cytokine production and release by t cells il-1 il-2 il-6 and il-18 tnf- and ifn- reduced levels of chemokines ccl2 and cxcl10 inhibition of micro-rna expression decreased th17-related cytokines increased in treg activity and upregulated levels of ifn- and il-2 and il-10 inhibition of cytotoxic t cell and self-reactive cd4 lymphocyte activities decreased dna rna and protein synthesis in thymocytes 55 antimalarials have iron-binding and hydroxyl radical scavenging actions which may of benefit considering disrupted heme metabolism and oxidative stress 66 a strong antiviral activity of cq by using sars-cov-2infected vero cells has been documented 67 in a physiologically based pharmacokinetic models pbpk for each drug hcq showed five-fold more potency than cq in vitro 68 in both studies antiviral activity is dose-dependent and can be achieved with use of routine safe dosages although several in vitro studies report antiviral activity of cq and hcq against sars-cov-2 in vivo data are promising but have considerable limitations an expert consensus group in china suggested that cq may improve lung involvement evaluated at imaging with a shortening of the disease course 69 in another highly debated open-label nonrandomized controlled trial a small number of patients with covid-19 were treated with hcq nasal sars-cov-2 carriage was found to be lower on sixth day following hcq treatment as compared to non-treated patients 70 a recent multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial from china did not find sars-cov-2 negative conversion rates between high dose hcq and standard of care in 150 hospitalized patients with reporting more rapid resolution of symptoms normalization of crp and lymphopenia however outcome data on icu need and mortality was not reported here71 in another study comprising 181 hypoxic pneumonia patients from france hcq did not avert icu admission or mortality 72the dilemma on clinical utility of cq and hcq in covid-19 will be solved by well-designed clinical trials in near futurein several countries despite the weakness of clinical studies based on strong preclinic scientific rationale and multimodal antiviral and immunomodulatory actions cq and hcq are currently recommended for the treatment of covid-19 optimal dosing is uncertain and there are several dosing regimens 400 mg to as high as 1200 mg daily as is the treatment durations 510 days hcq was found to be more potent than cq in vitro and better tolerated based on pbpk models a loading dose 400 mg twice a day bid of hcq is given orally followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg bid for 4 days is the most commonly recommended strategy for sars-cov-2 infection as it reached three times greater potency of cq when given 500 mg twice daily for 5 days in advance 68 all hcq recommended doses for covid-19 are above the routine doses used in rheumatic diseases hence potential adverse events could be experienced also in this brief standing treatment in 2005 vincent et al reported that cq has strong antiviral effects on sars-cov-1 infection of primate cells with the use of drug either before or after exposure to the virus suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic use 61 animal models have shown that prophylactic use of cq may have an additional survival benefit in enteroviral infections 73 however there is still no robust evidence for the use of cq or hcq for pre- or postexposure prophylaxis of covid-19 there are several trials underway to evaluate the efficacy of cq or hcq in the prophylaxis of high-risk individuals nct04303507 nct04318444ivig is a blood product containing polyclonal immunoglobulin g isolated and pooled from healthy donors used to treat immune thrombocytopenic purpura itp kawasaki disease and various inflammatory neurologic and myositis syndromes it has immunomodulatory functions with unknown mechanism of action one of the proposed mechanisms is the interaction of igg-fc with fc gamma receptors located on almost all immune cells resulting in pleiotropic functional consequences including the expansion of regulatory t cell population phagocytosis antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity adcc immune cell differentiation and maturation apoptosis expression of proinflammatory cytokines and antigen-presentation 74 previous studies on sars and mers found that ivig therapy was effective thus proposing high-dose ivig as an option for severe covid-19 patients 75 there are a few covid-19 cases which reported efficacy of high dose ivig76 however its high cost and limited supply restrict its general use inferred from rheumatic diseases covid-19 patients with pregnancy secondary infections marked thrombocytopenia muscular myocardial and neurologic manifestations would be better candidates for ivig treatment there are several studies already registered for its use in covid-19 il-6 receptors ubiquitously expressed in almost all immune cells and il-6 acts as a master player inducing proliferation and differentiation of immune cells in healthy individuals the il-6 levels in circulation are extremely low and are in the range of 15 pgml marked elevations reported in many inflammatory conditions including cytokine release syndrome 77 several therapeutic agents have been developed inhibiting the cytokine itself the signaling via the il-6 receptor or its postreceptor downstream signaling pathways jakstat

cytokine release syndrome and idiopathic multicentric castlemans disease imcd whereas siltuximab received approval for imcd and sarilumab for ra only 78covid-19 patients have high plasma il-6 levels especially those with more severe disease presentation 37 il-6 production can be stimulated by sars-cov-2 itself or by stimulation of other immune cells 79 indeed it has been shown that during covid-19 cd4t lymphocytes are rapidly activated to differentiate into pathogenic th1 cells generating gm-csf and other proinflammatory cytokines which further induced activation of monocytes with high expression of il-6 80 in clinical view there is striking correlation between serum il-6 levels and sars-cov-2 rnaaemia which strongly indicates worse outcome44chen x zhao b qu y chen y xiong j et al

maximum 800 mg as single infusion after careful evaluation of disease severity and response to initial treatment a repeat infusion can be administered at the same dose after 1224 h il-6 antagonists increase the risk of infections therefore must be used in severe patients and at the end of the high viral load phase of covid-19 along with antiviral treatments 75 there are other side effects including intestinal perforation and opportunistic infections therefore it is prudent to monitor patients for potential side effectsjak inhibitors are potent inhibitors of one or more of the jak

arthritis and their use in other inflammatory disorders are continuously growing 84 many proinflammatory cytokines involved in cytokine storm of covid-19 might be inhibited by jak inhibitors besides above mentioned common properties of jak inhibitors baricitinib may block ap-2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 and cyclin g-associated kinase gak which are host kinases that regulate viral endocytosis according to an artificial intelligence search of viral characteristics of sars-cov-2 this effect is only restricted to baricitinib among other jak inhibitors and it may block viral entry and assembly of virus particles into pneumocytes in therapeutic doses used in ra 85 however these hypothetical views merit further evidence for clinical use both for cytokine storm and covid-19

diseases by suppressing their inflammatory component 92 its mechanism of action is thought to be the inhibition of tubulin polymerization and microtubule generation and possibly effects on cellular adhesion molecules inflammatory chemokines and the inflammasome colchicine may inhibit activation of nlrp3 inflammasome and additionally may inhibit directly the synthesis of tnf- and il-6 93 trials investigating the efficacy of conventional therapeutic doses of colchicine have been registered for the treatment of covid-19 nct04322682 nct04328480 nct04326790tnf- is one of the most potent proinflammatory cytokines with broad spectrum of actions marked elevations reported in many inflammatory conditions including cytokine release syndrome serum tnf- levels found elevated in covid-19 patients with being more pronounced in more severe patients 36 sars-cov viral spike protein is able to modulate tnf--converting enzyme tace-dependent shedding of the ace2 ectodomain required for the viral entry which is coupled to tnf- production 94 therefore it is hypothesized that the use of tnf inhibitors might be effective in blocking viral entry and detrimental effects of exuberant tnf- as shown in preclinical studies on severe respiratory syncytial virus and influenza infections 95 anti-tnfs enhance the risk of bacterial viral and fungal infections therefore their use in covid-19 must be supported with preclinical studies one of the cytokines found abundant in covid-19 patients is il-17 and found associated with severe lung inflammation 36 il-17 has wide-ranging proinflammatory effects on induction of cytokines il-1 il-6 tnf- growth factors g-csf chemokines and matrix metalloproteinases in a mouse model it was found that h1n1 cause acute lung injury in an il-17-dependent manner it has been postulated that blocking this cytokine may be effective in reducing sars-cov-2 related organ damage 96as mentioned gm-csf is one of the key molecules involved in cytokine storm which is excessively released in covid-19 patients 80 blockage of this growth factor may halt immunopathology caused by virus mavrilimumab is a gm-csf inhibitor developed for the refractory ra 97 and a new trial is investigating its efficacy in covid-19 nct04337216mmf is widely used for the treatment of severe manifestations of connective tissue disorders and vasculitis syndromes mycophenolate

with ifn- on mers patients 99 however considering strong immunosuppressant effects of mmf it is likely to cause more harm than benefit in covid-19 patientsan association between ibuprofen and worse outcome in covid-19 patients was speculated with very weak evidence 100 another nsaid indomethacin reported to have direct antiviral effect on sars-cov by interfering with viral rna synthesis independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition in an in vitro study a registered trial currently recruiting patients to determine efficacy of naproxen for its potential interaction with viral nucleoproteins nct04325633 therefore although evidence is limited indomethacin or naproxen could be preferred over other nsaids when indicated 101excessive inflammatory response with features of cytokine storm cause severe disease course and worsens the prognosis in covid-19 undoubtedly drugs that directly target sars-cov-2 would be the most effective treatments for covid-19 there are hundreds of trials ongoing to find effective treatments for covid-19 both targeting virus and consequent hyperinflammation including newly developed agents on phase studies or drugs that are approved for other indications until an effective treatment is found drugs that are used in daily rheumatology practice may constitute potential treatment options in covid-19 patients not only by their antiinflammatory effects but also with some of their inherent antiviral properties hence inclusion of rheumatologists immunologists into covid teams would improve patient outcomes we would like to thank burcu avanolu for her illustrations no funding has been received for this paperthe covid-19 pandemic is claiming many victims among those infected worldwide patients prognosis depends primarily but not exclusively on their viral load the response of the hosts immune system is partly responsible either by default in immunocompromised patients or paradoxically by excess - when a destructive cytokine storm occurs in the lung as a result of an exaggerated mobilization of the hosts immune cells this cytokine storm seems to be the most serious prognostic factor because it aggravates the inflammatory thrombophilic state leading to a disseminated intravascular coagulation dic - a situation difficult to control and potentially fatal there is no clear scientific evidence as yet to indicate what triggers a cytokine storma highly contagious virus like influenza a which causes annual flu epidemics all over the world has been known to trigger such cytokine storms too leading to inflammation the need for hospitalization and even death the mechanisms behind such cytokine storms that make some individuals suffer more from the flu than others remain unclear however a study on influenza a virus infection in mice showed that glucose metabolism was a driving force behind the onset of the often fatal inflammatory response known as a cytokine storm mice treated with glucosamine produced significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines than mice not given glucosamine when researchers analyzed blood glucose levels in patients diagnosed with influenza a and healthy controls they found that the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway by means of which a small portion of glucose is metabolized plays an essential part in cytokine storms triggered by the influenza virus these findings may partly explain why diabetics are at greater risk of serious complications and death from influenza and other infections preliminary data indicate that this appears to be the case for covid-19 as well 1 both hyper and hypoglycemia are independent predictor of hospital mortality in critically ill individuals independent of severity of illness diabetes diagnosis or length of stay in the intensive care unit icu 2 3patients metabolic conditions could therefore have a crucial role in determining the release of certain proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1-beta il-1 an in vitro study of ours conducted some time ago showed that monocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes and normal controls overproduced il-1 when tested in a low-glucose milieu 4 this happened already in basal conditions but even more in the presence of a known proinflammatory factor lipopolysaccharide lps the structure of which contains glucosamine a picture similar to the experiment conducted by wang et al the same did not happen under normal and high-glucose conditions not even in the presence of lps on the other hand monocytes retained their anti-inflammatory capacity by overproducing anti-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin 10 il-10 in response to lps but only in the presence of normal glucose concentrationsit has been reported that hypoglycemic conditions induce an upregulation of the glut 3 glucose transporter in the plasma membrane of the monocyte-macrophage 5 and that lps amplifies glut 3 overexpression 6 glut 3 upregulation is a self-regulating mechanism to ensure an adequate glucose supply to the cells and thus protect monocytes against the harmful effects of low glucose levels thus amplifying inflammatory cell activation in the presence of lps wright et al showed that acute hypoglycemia induced by hyperinsulinemic clamping led to an increase in cd40 expression an inflammatory activation index on monocytes in type 1 diabetic patients 7in vivo hypoglycemia may induce an increase in counter-regulatory hormonal adrenergic activity as well resulting in further inflammatory stress 8hypoglycemia therefore besides representing a risk factor of cardiovascular and total mortality for all causes in diabetic patients could represent a trigger mechanism for the cytokine storm during covid-19 disease 9in the light of these experimental data we recommend pursuing optimal glycemic control avoiding both hyper and hypoglycemia to prevent or mitigateany cytokine storms and thus improve the otherwise dismal prognosis for both diabetic and not diabetic patients admitted to semi-intensive or icu with covid-19conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interestfunding the authors received no funding from an external sourcesars-cov-2 infects epithelial lung cells via specific interactions with the
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace210 while efforts
are being made worldwide to better understand the cytokine storm that
characterizes the progression to severe pneumonia or ards previous
information from sars-cov and mers-cov infections shown in figure 1 indicates the main
factors1113 it is known that the virus replicates very quickly
in the early stages of infection this means that high levels of viral
proteins known to antagonize interferon ifn responses are generated which
results in a strong yet delayed proinflammatory response at the site of
infection these pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines attract
macrophages and neutrophils that also release pro-inflammatory agents this
amplifies the inflammation giving rise to ards sepsis or multiorgan
dysfunction syndrome mods all of which are associated with poor
outcomes14 a comprehensive review of the cytokines
and chemokines involved in the covid-19 cytokine storm is already available
although studies performed in large cohorts of patients have not been
performed12 these are required in order to
determine cutoff values for diagnosis and prognosis purposespro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 il-8 and tumor necrosis factor
alpha tnf- have been found elevated in the sera of severely and
critically ill covid-19 patients1524
this indicates that these cytokines could be good prognosis biomarkers that
is they could indicate the progression to severe or critical covid-19 many
recent cytokine profiling studies however have only been performed in
small populations and therefore cannot be broadly
generalized1722 larger studies are required to
establish cutoff values as well as to determine the intricate relationships
between pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in covid-19 progression based on
other hyperinflammatory syndromes such as sepsis the levels of these
biomarkers will likely fluctuate rapidly this means that patients with
inflammation biomarkers below a certain threshold value may evolve quickly
and require anti-inflammatory treatments even though their initial biomarker
measurements indicated otherwise a solution to this problem could be to
perform periodic measurements of biomarkers in order to evaluate their
kinetics23 this would require biosensors that are
inexpensive and easy to use at the point of care in order to not overburden
healthcare workers it should also be noted that although cytokines are
also present in saliva urine and sputum24 no
information is currently available about their function and usefulness as
biomarkers for cytokine storm monitoring in covid-19 measuring cytokines in
sputum could be particularly valuable because it would reveal information
about local inflammation however only 3040 of covid-19 patients
produce sputum16anti-inflammatory cytokines such as il-10 have also been found in the sera of
covid-19 patients2225 it
is known from other hyperinflammatory syndromes that dysregulated
inflammation is often followed by immune suppression26
putting these patients at high risk of opportunistic infections from
bacteria fungi or even latent viruses such as human cytomegalovirus
cmv2729 this is particularly problematic in the context of
the icu since nosocomial infections by multiresistant pathogens can be
lethal if not promptly detected because of this we anticipate that
biosensors aimed at detecting coinfections will also be required in order to
manage critical covid-19 patients for example biosensors that detect
procalcitonin pct could be useful to detect opportunistic bacterial
infections3032 procalcitonin is produced in parenchymal cells in
response to bacterial toxins in healthy individuals pct is considered
undetectable below 005 ng ml1 pct levels above
12 ng ml1 are usually considered as a warning of
potential bacterial sepsis33 since pct levels do not
rise to such a large extent in viral infections biosensors for this
biomarker could indicate the onset of bacterial infections in covid-19
patientstable 1 summarizes some
anti-inflammatory treatments proposed so far for ameliorating the cytokine
storm in covid-19 patients it should be noted that the evidence supporting
these treatments is weak in other words randomized clinical trials for
these drugs in the context of covid-19 care have not yet been completed
their use is not recommended in official protocols by who only for clinical
trials or compassionate motives many are repurposed drugs already in use
for other diseases and syndromes but not for infections34 it is important to highlight this as many of these pharmaceuticals are
immunosuppressive since covid-19 patients are already immunosuppressed due
to ifn attenuation and anti-inflammatory responses the administration of
these immunomodulators may exacerbate the risk of an opportunistic infection
or reduce the effect of antiviral drugsa good example of the polemic surrounding these anti-inflammatory treatments is
the use of corticosteroids corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone are
inexpensive and globally available they are not routinely recommended for
sepsis care except in cases of septic shock previous evidence from
sars-cov-1 and mers patients treated with corticosteroids yielded widely
disparate outcomes11 and the who and idsa have
discouraged the use of corticosteroids for covid-19 care nevertheless
several authors report good outcomes when administering these drugs at
cautious doses83536 of those reporting good
outcomes dosing and timing have been highlighted as the key factors for
successful corticosteroid therapy in the context of sars-cov infections
kinetic profiles of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 could provide
crucial data to guide the onset of corticosteroid treatment and adjust doses
in order to reduce inflammation while minimizing side effects37 other nonspecific anti-inflammatory treatments that
could benefit from biosensor-guided administration are
hydroxychloroquine7 immunoglobulins
azithromycin38 and convalescent plasma
therapies39drugs based on monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins such as
tocilizumab40 or anakinra41 have
also been proposed for reducing hyperinflammation caused by covid-19 these
treatments block specific pro-inflammatory signal pathways these drugs
could benefit from a companion diagnostics approach similar
to that which is used in cancer care that is the administration of these
drugs would be guided by measurements of the specific pro-inflammatory
factors they modulate for example tocilizumab binds receptors of il-6
both soluble and membrane-bound this blocks the interaction with
membrane-bound gp130 which in turn prevents the activation of a downstream
janus kinase responsible for signal cascading42 it has
been proposed that blockers of the il6-mediated inflammatory response such
as tocilizumab and sarilumab should be guided by il-6 measurements with a
threshold value around 20 pg ml14344 these
antibodies have proven to be useful to treat unwanted cytokine release
syndromes in immune anticancer therapies some early reports on the benefits
of using tocilizumab are encouraging although a clinical trial for
sarilumab has recently been discontinued due to a lack of clear positive
outcomes interestingly serial il-6 measurements have shown that after the
administration of tocilizumab there is a slight increase in il-6 followed by
sharp decrease over time43 these early reports highlight
the relevance of performing kinetic measurements of biomarkers for
monitoring the progress of inflammatory diseasestable s1 summarizes the main features of recent biosensor
prototypes for cytokine detection as highlighted above time-dependent pro-
and anti-inflammatory responses are involved in covid-19 progression a
multisensor system capable of detecting several of these biomarkers
simultaneously would provide evidence to determine disease stage and guide
personalized therapies for example it has been reported that plasmonic
nanosensor arrays can detect 6 cytokines simultaneously il-2 il-6 il-4
il-10 ifn- and tnf- figure 2a45 these multisensors
require a minute sample size 1 l and show an impressive dynamic
range for quantification between 10 and 10 000 pg ml1
the signal transduction mechanism consists of measuring changes in the
localized surface plasmon resonance lspr of gold nanorods with dark-field
microscopy this provides information about cytokine binding to antibodies
in real time which is more informative than traditional end-point elisa
the total time required to run the whole chip is only 40 min the rapid
analysis time makes this detection platform suitable for aiding clinical
decision-making in emergency situations another interesting multisensor
platform using electrochemical transducers is shown in figure 2b it contains 32 individually
addressable electrodes each one multiplexed with an 8-port manifold to
provide 256 measurements in less than 1 h46 however it
also requires an off-line protein capture step on magnetic nanobeads
electrochemical immunoassays for il-6 with these devices reported a wide
dynamic range between 01 and 104 pg ml1
multiplexed cytokine measurements with electrochemical biosensors have also
been reported using graphene oxide to fabricate nanoprobes47 this platform detects il-6 il-1 and tnf-
spiked into the same mouse serum sample the multiplexed detection was
achieved by using antibodies bound to three different signal reporters nile
blue nb methyl blue mb and ferrocene fccovid-19 is a global challenge and requires technologies that are easy to
implement in many different scenarios the oversaturation of hospitals
during the peak of the infection has forced some governments to decentralize
covid-19 care and manage patients in temporary field hospitals and in-home
quarantine in these scenarios detection systems that are not bound by
centralized infrastructure play a key role for instance a lateral flow
immunoassay has been proposed for detecting il-6 in unprocessed blood with
high sensitivity48 the ability to detect cytokines
directly from blood is extremely useful in decentralized healthcare
scenarios since purifying serum or plasma requires a centrifugation step
that is difficult to perform at the bedside however blood contains cells
like erythrocytes which can interfere with colorimetric detection schemes
the lateral flow test used antibody-decorated nanoparticles as probes and
surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy sers as the signal transduction
mechanism it showed a limit of detection of 5 pg ml1 in
whole blood this limit of detection however was achieved with a dxr raman
microscope which is not suitable for point-of-care use over the past
decade a growing trend in biosensors has been to interface them with mobile
devices such as smartphones4951 this is an appealing option because
smartphones already have a high global market penetration and therefore do
not require the purchase of additional readers mobile biosensors for il-6
have been recently proposed52 the devices consist of a
paper immunosensor for colorimetric detection using gold nanoprobes figure 2c the gold nanoprobes
generate colored spots that are detected in real time with a smartphone app
instead of external attachments the app uses an augmented reality system in
order to control photographic conditions this system also compensates for
variable light conditions allowing the user to quantify colorimetric
signals using only an unmodified smartphone the biosensor was able to
detect variations in il-6 levels as small as 125 pg ml1
in whole blood and with a rapid assay time of only 18 min furthermore the
paper substrate makes it particularly useful for monitoring infectious
diseases because it can be easily disposed of by incinerationbiosensors capable of continuously monitoring cytokine levels would be ideal
for detecting covid-19 patients progressing to severe or critical stages as
well as to check the success of anti-inflammatory therapies while to the
best of our knowledge immunosensors for continuous detection of biomarkers
in blood have not yet been proposed some prototypes with the potential to
achieve this feature can be found in the recent literature for example
needle-shaped microelectrodes have been proposed for detecting alterations
in il-6 levels in real time figure 3a53 in this design the interaction
between the cytokine and antibodies bound to the electrode changes the
impedance of the system without the need for detection antibodies or labels
the authors suggest that integrating the sensors with a cannula within the
bloodstream could enable the real-time monitoring of il-6 levels although
the initial prototype was only tested in surrogate serum samples recently
an electrochemical biosensor capable of continuous monitoring in blood
samples has been proposed it consists of a wire electrode modified with
aptamers that change their configuration upon binding their target figure 3b54
this changes the position of a redox active molecule methylene blue with
respect to the electrode which can be followed with square-wave voltammetry
figure 3c the authors
demonstrated that the sensors implanted in a rat could detect vancomycin as
a target molecule in real time figure 3d adapting this technology for detecting cytokines could
enable a precise profiling of the covid-19 inflammation55 finally a wearable detection platform has also been proposed that could
be a game-changer in inflammation monitoring56 it is
based on the intradermal delivery of biocompatible near-infrared nir
quantum dots an array of these nanosensors is delivered using dissolvable
microneedles the fluorescence emission of the quantum dots was fine-tuned
so that they would be invisible to the naked eye but detectable upon
illumination with nir light the pattern of emitted light generated by the
array can be detected with a modified smartphone and evaluated with a
machine learning algorithm while this technology has initially been
demonstrated as a way to keep vaccination records adaptation for continuous
monitoring of biomarkers could revolutionize the field of personalized
medicineto date there have been more than 264 000 deaths due to covid-19
worldwide social distancing measures have flattened the virus propagation
curve and many countries are relaxing confinement measures at the same
time there is also a consensus view that the virus will not be eradicated
until a vaccine is developed and deployed until then new tools are
required in order to reduce the burden of covid-19 it is imperative to
avoid the progression from severe pneumonia to critical ards measuring
prognosis biomarkers and combining this knowledge with clinical observations
and risk factors is a winning strategy for stratifying patients according to
disease severity biosensors have the potential to play a central role in
this process by providing rapid information at the point of care they could
also provide guidance for the administration of immunomodulators which can
have deleterious effects if they are not dosed carefullyfor this to happen several translational challenges need to be met from a
technological perspective to ensure rapid measurements at the point of
care devices must be easy to use by a frontline healthcare worker this
means that analytical platforms should enable the detection of cytokines in
one simple step also biosensors need to be inexpensive enough to enable
multiple measurements this is important because inflammatory processes
evolve rapidly and therefore it would be ideal to obtain a personalized
biomarker profile for each patient implanted biosensors could enable a
continuous monitoring of patients however this technology still needs
further development and regulatory aspects for future commercialization will
be much tougher than nonimplanted biosensors multisensors are also seen as
key players in precision medicine for covid-19 because they provide
information about the relative levels of different pro- and
anti-inflammatory processes which is important to design personalized
therapiesall in all we propose that the ideal device for managing the cytokine storm
responsible for severe and critical covid-19 cases should encompass all the
features of current biosensors that is they should monitor the levels of
several cytokines simultaneously in raw blood samples have a rapid
turnaround time be easy to dispose of and use portable readers paper
biosensors can be destroyed by incineration which is important to meet
biosafety regulations readers should also be easily disinfected especially
for decentralized testing wearable biosensors would enable the continuous
monitoring of patients a much-desired feature however the technology
still needs further development to be ready for clinical translation the
information provided by these devices should then be combined with patient
data age comorbidities treatments microbiology results in order to
assess the risk of a poor prognosis using the information from these
biosensors to train a neural network has the potential to achieve this
goalcoronavirus disease covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has rapidly caused a pandemic recent reports showed that individuals with obesity may be more vulnerable to severe complications of covid-19 by virtue of the increased risk of chronic diseases driven by obesity 1 the reasons for this are not well known but chronic inflammation is suspected to be one of the causes obesity is a state of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation which is characterized by increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion from adipose tissue and the infiltration of leukocytes including macrophages into the adipose tissue thus this chronic inflammation impairs insulin signaling in adipocytes causing insulin resistance and contributing to the development of metabolic disorders such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes and hypertension 2 which are well known comorbidities that adversely affect the outcome of patients with covid-19in addition patients with severe covid-19 commonly show cytokine storms which refer to an excessive and uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor- monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and interleukin-6 il-6 in particular serum il-6 levels in those with severe covid-19 were significantly higher than in those with mild cases 1 3 although most people with covid-19 develop no symptoms or have only mild illness the evidence shows that about 14 of covid-19 patients develop severe symptoms requiring hospitalization and oxygen support while 5 develop acute respiratory distress syndrome sepsis septic shock and multiorgan failure 4 5 and these are all related to inflammatory responsesindividuals living with obesity have chronically higher leptin and lower adiponectin concentrations this unfavorable hormone status leads to a dysregulation of the immune response and can contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity-related complications 6 in the basal state individuals with obesity have a higher concentration of proinflammatory cytokines under viral infection obesity-related chronic inflammation causes reduced macrophage activation and blunts proinflammatory cytokine production upon macrophage stimulation 7 the reduced macrophage activation by viral infection may explain the poor vaccination response in obese patients moreover b- and t-cell responses are impaired in individuals with obesity with numerical and functional alterations of lymphocytes and these alterations may increase susceptibility to viral infection thus this dysregulated proinflammatory response contributes to the severe lung lesions seen during the covid-19 pandemic 6 based on this mechanism individuals with obesity who already have low-level chronic inflammation may be more vulnerable to cytokine storms by covid-19 infectionto curb these cytokine storms in covid-19 patients anti-inflammatory treatment may be beneficial however the use of anti-inflammatory treatments can be a double-edged sword anti-inflammatory medications such as corticosteroids may delay the elimination of the virus and increase the risk of secondary infection especially in those with impaired immune systems some proinflammatory cytokine antagonists for example il-6 antagonists can only inhibit specific inflammatory factors and thus may eliminate adverse effects of cytokine storms without preventing the effects of other inflammatory cytokines in removing sars-cov-2 from the infected organs a recent study showed that colchicine treatment had a beneficial effect in adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome in reducing il-6 8 which may translate to a beneficial effect in people with obesity and covid-19 infection however anti-inflammatory medications such as janus kinase inhibitors which were recently reported to treat covid-19 patients can inhibit a variety of inflammatory cytokines including interferon- which plays an important role in suppressing virus activity and thus may not be suitable for treatment of inflammatory cytokine storms caused by covid-19 9given the viral nature of cytokine storms and the substantial impairment of immune systems in severe cases it is critical to strike a balance between up- and downregulation of inflammatory markers for immune homeostasis in addition starting anti-inflammatory treatment at the right time is of pivotal importance and should be tailored in individual patients to achieve the most favorable effectsthe combined use of anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs may be applied as well as we mentioned above some anti-inflammatory therapies may increase viral replication on the other hand antiviral treatment to inhibit sars-cov-2 replication and block sars-cov-2 infection may induce proinflammatory cytokine production 10 therefore additional large-cohort studies are required to substantiate or dismiss this possibility before applying clinical trialsthere are a few studies suggesting that individuals with obesity may be at higher risk of poor outcomes from covid-19 by hyperinflammation the inflammatory response may be uncontrolled due to malfunctioning or exhausted immune cells such as b and t cells and macrophages in those with obesity and low-level chronic inflammation 7 therefore further large-scale studies are needed to confirm the role of obesity-induced inflammation in the pathogenesis of covid-19 in this context a wide variety of strategies such as increased vigilance early detection and testing and aggressive treatment should be established for patients with obesity and covid-19 infectiontherapeutic approaches to mitigate the severe acute lung injury associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection have rapidly entered clinical trials primarily on anecdotal observations and few clinical studies along with the clinical symptoms related to viral invasion the reported molecular response known as the cytokine storm has attracted the greatest attention in both the scientific and the lay press as a cause of organ injury the hypothesis that quelling this storm with anti-inflammatory therapies directed at reducing interleukin-6 il-6 il-1 or even tumour necrosis factor  tnf might be beneficial has led to several ongoing trials anecdotal evidence from non-controlled clinical trials has suggested a possible beneficial effect and anti-il-6 has been shown to be effective in chimeric antigen receptor t car-t and cytokine response syndrome crs1 2 however past attempts in randomised clinical trials to block the cytokine storm associated with other microbial infections and with sepsis have not been successful and in some cases have worsened outcomes3 4 redundancy of cytokine action delayed intervention and the essential role of these cytokines in recovery and immune surveillance have all been proposed as possible explanations for these findingsthe first reports from china emphasised elevated plasma concentrations of il-6 and provided a rationale for the introduction of anti-il-6 therapies tocilizumab and sarulimab in randomised clinical trials5 6 however closer examination of plasma il-6 concentrations has provided conflicting data results from early studies suggested that plasma il-6 concentrations although elevated hundreds of picograms per l above values obtained from healthy control patients were modest especially when compared with the cytokine storm associated with septic shock in which concentrations might be in the high hundreds to thousands of picograms per l although more recent controlled studies indicate that plasma il-6 concentrations can be in the range seen in bacterial infections the time course of change is very different in some cases concentrations in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 seem to increase over time with illness severity and worsening lung function6 these dynamics clearly distinguish the sars-cov-2 host response from that seen in sepsis additionally previous sepsis studies established that il-6 concentrations might be an indicator of the magnitude of the inflammatory response rather than the cause of organ injury7 therefore it is important to ask whether current therapeutic approaches are only targeting symptoms or are modulating the disease itselflittle is known about the concentrations of other proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators in patients with covid-19 the landscape of the cytokine storm and especially the chemokines that regulate the distribution and activity of effector cell populations interpreting changes in cytokine concentrationsall seem to be elevatedwithout additional immune cellular parameters does not provide clarity about the molecular basis of covid-19 or potential treatment strategies indeed when measured in patients infected with sars-cov-2 il-10 concentrations the most immunosuppressant cytokine in the body are also elevated which might lead to a different conclusion for therapeutic approaches and in understanding the disease pathophysiology similarly there is concern that suppressing the innate and adaptive immune system to address increased cytokine concentrations such as elevated il-6 could enable unfettered viral replication suppress adaptive immunity and delay recovery processeslost in the current enthusiasm for anti-inflammatory approaches to sars-cov-2 infection is the growing recognition that potent immunosuppressive mechanisms are also prevalent in such patients this focus is reminiscent of that seen in the early investigations of sepsis-induced inflammation since it was nearly a decade later that the contribution of immune suppression to sepsis pathology was generally accepted profound lymphopenia low absolute lymphocyte counts alc often to levels seen in septic shock is a near uniform finding in severely ill patients with covid-19 and correlates with increased secondary infections and mortality8 9 this loss of immune effector cells occurs in all lymphocyte subsets including cd8 and natural killer cells which have important antiviral roles and b cells which are essential for making antibodies that inactivate the virus10 11 12 autopsy results have revealed a near complete dissolution of some secondary lymphoid organs13 unsurprisingly secondary nosocomial infections often with pathogens usually associated with immune suppression are present in up to 50 of hospitalised patients8
this early immunological picture of sars-cov-2 infection is one that shares many similarities with bacterial sepsis but some unique differences should be noted figure
 in particular the modest inflammatory response and the progressive and profound suppression of adaptive immunity in covid-19 relative to sepsis argues for perhaps a different therapeutic approach supporting host protective immunity must be considered as an essential component of any therapeutic intervention of equal importance to or perhaps greater importance than targeting the cytokine stormwhat is the most rational approach to supporting host protective immunity several immune stimulants in the clinical armamentarium are available for patients infected with sars-cov-2 focusing on agents that target adaptive immunity in general and t-cell function in particular appears to be the most rational approach based on the observation of progressive loss of t cells12 14 programmed death ligand pathway eg pd-1 inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab have been game changers in cancer and some other viral infections15 16 t cells from patients with covid-19 show evidence of t-cell exhaustion associated with increased cd279 pd-1 expression11 12
in addition to checkpoint inhibitors the pluripotent cytokine il-7 has been effective in multiple other viral infections17 18 19 early clinical trials of both treatments have been initiated in sepsis and shown to be safe and to have biological activity20 il-7 has shown benefit in raising lymphocyte counts in septic patients with low alc20 and in restoring protective immunity in jc virus-induced progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy18 19 21 22 its effectiveness and that of other immune stimulants has only begun to be explored in sepsis and should be considered in sars-cov-2 infection although immune stimulants such as il-7 or nivolumab could theoretically feed the cytokine storm both have been given to patients with sepsis with il-6 concentrations similar to that in patients with covid-19 without exacerbation of inflammatory responses15
randomised clinical trials based on the best observational findings remain paramount to moving forward and we would propose starting with il-7 because of the complexity of the host response and the fact that monotherapies have not worked in sepsis trials in the past we suggest that priority be given to biological response modifiers that are pluripotent such as il-7 or combination therapies that target multiple immunological pathways simultaneously il-7 and anti-pd-1what has treating patients with sepsis taught us about treatment approaches for patients with covid-19 like sepsis antimicrobials antivirals in this case and supportive therapies are likely to remain the bedrock of therapeutic interventions for sars-cov-2 infection however if sars-cov-2 infection is similar to other chronic inflammatory and immune suppressive diseases such as sepsis we argue that immune stimulants and not anti-inflammatory agents should be considered as the first-line treatment option however we fully recognise that the pathophysiology and mechanisms of sars-cov-2 are still being elucidated and that there is great uncertainty in predicting the efficacy of current therapeutic approaches we are only just starting to explore the interplay of virus-mediated endothelial damage pathogenreceptor signalling effects including ace2 and alterations in haemostasis and coagulation as a basis for the heterogeneous clinical pathologies seen in patients undeniably there might be a subset of patients with exaggerated proinflammatory cytokine release that could derive benefit from anti-il-6 or anti-il-1 therapies however until better methods are available to determine among the heterogeneity in clinical phenotypes which patients meet these criteria it will be difficult to establish a benefit observations from clinical centres dealing with large volumes of patients with covid-19 show compelling evidence that patient mortality is directly related to multiorgan failure including coagulopathy and probably damage to the endothelium these patients also have altered immune function as shown by lymphopenia we suspect that a balanced biologically plausible approach would be to provide anti-inflammatory treatment early in the disease course coupled with antiviral therapies such as remdesivir however as the disease transitions to a suppressed state therapies that restore host protective immunity should be considered a high priority for patients in intensive care with progressing lung injurywhat else needs to be considered first better methods are needed to assess the functional status of immune cells in patients with covid-19 circulating cytokine concentrations might reflect the degree of systemic inflammation but are not indicative of the functional state of individual lymphocyte and myeloid populations readily applicable tests that inform on whether the adaptive immune system is exhausted or whether myeloid cells are activated or tolerant would better guide application of drugs that can appropriately modulate the immune response it would also enable balanced immune therapies targeted to either innate or adaptive immune cells this approach is being used in cancer immunotherapy today and is being tested in the treatment of sepsis this balanced therapeutic approach will allow precise deployment of inhibitory anti-il-6 and anti-il-1 or restorative il-7 and checkpoint inhibitors therapies probably all as adjuvants to antiviral drugssecond we need better measures of viral load with a rapid turnaround time we recognise that our ability to identify and quantitate bacterial infections in patients with sepsis is still quite rudimentary and quantifying viral loads by qpcr has not provided the required precision which has hindered our ability to assess the effectiveness of interventionsmost importantly in designing and conducting interventional trials in patients with covid-19 we need to remember the lessons learned from the ongoing sepsis epidemic that kills 250 000 people annually in the usa inflammation is often transitory and the surviving sepsis campaign has shown that earlier recognition and more immediate implementation of best practices can reduce early mortality and organ injury due to the cytokine storm conversely immune suppression is prolonged progressive and ultimately lethal effective treatment of patients in this pandemic needs to be balanced to be administered with precision to individual patients and to build on our knowledge of past failures so that we can achieve future successesdear editorwe recently read with interest the article by acharya et al entitled sars-cov-2 infection leads to neurological dysfunction acharya et al 2020 they have reviewed current literature on the neurological complications and manifestations of covid-19 however they were able to identify only a very limited number of studies in fact in our latest paper we have provided a deeper insight on the pathophysiology of the central nervous system involvement of covid-19 and discussed that neuropsychiatric manifestations related covid-19 might be associated with the involvement of both direct viral transmission and neuroimmune response yesilkaya and balcioglu 2020 latter includes heightened systemic proinflammatory response which is closely associated with so-called cytokine storm a well-known phenomenon led by sars-cov-2 infectionas viral replication progressively decreases during the latter days of infection the pathogenesis of covid-19 has been thought to be predominantly related to an aggressive inflammatory response thus the intense release of proinflammatory cytokines viz cytokine storm in the host leads to diffuse alveolar damage severe hypoxemia and promotes the development of fatal secondary sepsis serrano-castro et al 2020 even though the cytokine storm has been a well-defined condition in many viral infections including influenza and coronavirus liu et al 2016 our appreciation of its effects on the central nervous system cns has remained limitedthe primary targets for sars cov-2 are respiratory epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages following the infection of respiratory cells rapid production and release of many chemokines and cytokines initiate macrophages are activated by such proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines and other key components of the innate immune system dendritic cells lead to a more extensive immune response that initiates the cytokine storm circulating chemokines attract more inflammatory cells to make them migrate from blood vessels into the site of inflammation and these cells release additional chemokinescytokines which amplify cytokine storm liu et al 2016 although tnf-  il-1 and il-6 are primary cytokines of the acute immune response and the interferons are key cytokines for antiviral immune response the excessive response of these proinflammatory mediators have been considered major triggers of sepsis and multiorgan failure unal et al 2020 on the other hand the cns might be the first affected organ due to a compromised blood-brain barrier which is closely associated with increased circulating levels of cytokines these cytokines induce the production of reactive oxygen species through a stimulation of astrocytes and glial cells meneses et al 2019reactive oxygen species and peripheral cytokines activate two different types of microglia microglia-1 m1 and microglia-2 m2 while m1 involve in inflammatory processes in the cns m2 are responsible for the anti-inflammatory processes thus m1 activation results in an increase of proinflammatory cytokines and m2 initiate the astrogliosis in order to cns protection all of these opposite reactions induced by sars-cov-2 may cause a cns dysfunction that becomes apparent as encephalopathy another pathologic reaction related to sars-cov-2 might involve in sensorial olfactory nerves olfactory nerves are activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps and inflammatory cytokines the viral transmission in the olfactory bulb leads a neuroinflammatory response through an excessive release of cytokines to protect the cns therefore anosmia an initial symptom of covid-10 might be a result of such neuroinflammatory response meneses et al 2019despite the arguments identified above our knowledge is still limited to what extent such neuroinflammatory reactions does sars-cov-2 associate with we would like to emphasize the importance of long term follow-up and neuropsychiatric monitoring should be performed in patients with covid-19 psychoneuroimmunological characteristics of covid-19 which seem to be key for the neurological involvement of the disease still needs to be elucidated indeedsince december 2019 an acute severe viral infectionivolving primarily the respiratory system has emerged with rapid transmission around the world to over a million people within a few months named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization 1 the disease pandemic has resulted in a major health crisis the pathogen of covid-19 has been attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 a novel beta coronavirus closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 2 covid-19 has resulted in many infections and death throughout the world 3 unlike those seen in influenza the morbidity and transmission modality of covid-19 appear more severe and uncontrollable 4 the primary pulmonary injury and subsequent cardiovascular complications constitute the key pathophysiology of this deadly disease this review updates and summarizes the pathophysiological features possible underlying mechanisms and clinical characteristics of pulmonary and cardiovascular injury of covid-19the highly contagious virus sars-cov-2 has been identified as the primary pathogen responsible for the development of covid-19 it belongs to the coronaviridae family 5 structurally and functionally similar to most members of the betacoranavirus subgroup b sars-cov-2 fig 1
 has thought to be descended from a bat gene pool as the seventh member of coronavirus family known to infect humans and comprises a positive-sense single-stranded rna with 50200nm in size 6 among the other 6 coronaviruses capable of causing illnesses only sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov reportedly cause severe disease and fatalities 7 infection by the other 4 coronaviruses remains asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in normal people according to the full-length genome sequencing sars-cov-2 is 795 homologous with sars-cov like sars-cov sarscov2 infects lung alveolar epithelial cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis in association with angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 8 an epidemiological study enrolling 44672 confirmed cases in china has indicated that the overall case-fatality rate of sars-cov-2 was about 23 9 whereas it was 96 7748096 in the sars-cov epidemic 10 and 344 8582494 in the mers-cov outbreak 11 mortality in italy spain and france may be higher and closer to that of sars-cov this may be due to strain variation yet to be determined however in consideration of rapidly increasing numbers of confirmed cases and evidence of human-to-human transmission 1213 the sars-cov-2 infectivity seems to be stronger than sars-cov and mers-cov ultrastructural examination of sars-cov-2 by cryo-electron microscopy has demonstrated that the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 to ace2 appears approximately 10- to 20-fold higher than sars-cov structurally explaining why sars-cov-2 has a high contagiousness 14in spite of the fact that sars-cov-2 has infected more than a million individuals it is largely unknown how and when the virus has been evolving and interacts with other microorganisms table 1
 in the lung and other vital organs such as heart and brain shen et al 15 has recently reported a genomic diversity of sars-cov-2 in patients with covid-19 they observed by meta-transcriptomal sequencing for the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from of covid-19 community-acquired pneumonia and healthy individuals they observed a limited polymorphism and diversity in the intra-host setting and a substantial proportion of bacteria in several covid-19 patients similar to other patients with non-coronaviral pneumonia as a common complication of viral infection especially for respiratory viruses secondary bacterial infection often results in a significant increase in morbidity or even mortality indeed in the retrospective observational study of 85 fatal cases of covid-19 du et al 16 reported that in addition to sars-cov-2 infection simultaneously or secondarily other pathogens may participate in the covid-19 development and complications contributing to the severity and mortality of covid-19 thus co-infection of other pathogens certainly complicates the pathogenesis and management of covid-19as recommended by who most countries including the united states have adapted similar diagnostic procedures for covid-19 and harvest certain clinical and epidemiologic information for diagnosis table 2
 in the united states criteria have been developed for persons under investigation pui for covid-19 people with confirmed covid-19 usually develop fever andor symptoms of acute respiratory illness eg cough difficulty breathing for the pui individuals health care providers should immediately put him or her under infection control and prevention measures initially testing for all other sources of respiratory infection is implemented while assessing epidemiologic factors to assist their diagnosis including the information as to whether the person has had close contact with a patient with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 within 14 days of symptom onset or a history of travel from affected geographic areas or epicenters within 14 daysdiagnosis of covid-19 requires collecting specimens from both the upper respiratory tract naso- and oropharyngeal samples and lower respiratory tract including the expectorated sputum endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage the samples need to be processed quickly and stored at four degrees celsius the reverse polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assays are a standard procedure for viral genomic sequence identification which involves the synthesis of a double-stranded dna molecule from the rna template if patients are confirmed covid-19 positively their laboratory evaluation should be repeated to evaluate for viral clearance prior to being released from quarantine patients with the early stage of covid-19 may have a normal or decreased total white blood cell count and a decreased lymphocyte count subsequently neutrophils arise wit lymphopenia and the increased ratio of neutriophils vs lymphocytes is considered a negative prognostic factor patients may have increased values of ldh muscle enzymes and c-reactive protein in critical patients the thrombogenic biomarker d-dimer may increase the counts of blood lymphocytes decline persistently and laboratory alterations in biomarkers of multi-organ injury become prominentthe clinical profiles and diagnosis for covid-19 have been well documented to date however new evidence is now emerging that this deadly disease is far more mystery than previously thought as many cases appeared atypical and easily misdiagnostic 17 according to the seventh edition 3 march 2020 of covid-19 guideline by the general office of national health committee and office of state administration of traditional chinese medicine china the notice on the issuance of program for the diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 trial version 7 2020 diagnosis of suspected case needs to combine any one item of epidemiological history features with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis or needs to meet three items of clinical manifestations with or without clear epidemiological history table 2 wang et al 18 suggest that diagnosing the confirmed case should base on suspected case with any one item of pathogenic or serological evidence as following 1 real-time pcr test positive for sars-cov-2 2 viral whole genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the known novel coronaviruses 3 positive for the specific igm antibody and igg antibody to sars-cov-2 in serum test or a change of the sars-cov-2-specific igg antibody from negative to positive or titer rising 4 times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phasesars-cov-2 mainly attacks the respiratory system clinically characterized by the rapid development of pneumonia and in severe cases the acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 19
 the death rate remains high in those admitted to the intensive care and on ventilator due to complications of respiratory and cardiac failure 16 even though the lung is the primary organ damaged by the virus covid-19 is now regarded as a systemic disease involving a broad range of other vital organs such as heart liver and kidney 20 however it remains largely unclear whether the organ and tissue injury in patients with covid-19 is the direct or indirect consequence of the virus infection ace2 a known protein binding to sars-cov-2 is expressed widely in various organs and tissues including the cardiovascular digestive and urogenital systems beside the respiratory tract 2122 theoretically the virus may target those organs and tissues with positive expression of ace2 cardiovascular cells are known to express ace2 at high levels which serves as a key regulator of blood pressure and cardiac contractility 23 moreover the virus infection may trigger a drastic immune response which leads to production of large quantities of cytokines ie cytokine storm which may indiscriminately injure vital organs 24 for instance sars-cov-2 infection injures the myocardium leading to elevated levels of myocardial biomarkers eg troponin i  28 pgml and certain abnormalities in electrocardiography and echocardiography 25 increasing clinical evidence indicates that virus infection-associated cardiac dysfunction worsen covid-19 patients clinical conditions usually in association with the poor prognosis 2627 in spite of the observation that myocardial injury occurs frequently in covid-19 patients 28 the underlying mechanisms remains largely unclear several lines of clinical evidence point to the possibility of viral infection directly occurring in the myocardium both direct and indirect pathogenic impacts of the virus infection may cause injury of the pulmonary and myocardial tissues fig 2
in epidemiology high prevalence of cardiovascular dysfunction has been recently reported in covid-19 patients especially those with critical medical conditions 29 in a study of 138 covid-19 patients 10 patients 72 were diagnosed as acute myocardial injury based on the elevation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i hs-ctni and 8 of them admitted into the intensive care unit icu 12 in another retrospective study cardiac troponin i ctni was significantly elevated in 333 of severe and 1000 of critical patients 30 huang et al also revealed increased numbers of covid-19 patients with acute myocardial injury and in the critical conditions leading to admission into icu 19recent autopsy reports have demonstrated several anatomical features of covid-19-induced pulmonary and myocardial injury the early lung of covid-19 patients exhibited edema proteinaceous exudate focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration and multinucleated giant cells 31 liu et al showed that the lung and cardiac tissues contain significant amounts of inflammatory infiltrates indicating the inflammatory nature of tissue damage by sars-cov-2 infection 26 patients with a medical history of coronary heart disease are prone to the cardiac injury caused by covid-19 although there was no evidence that the acute episode of cardiac injury was caused by coronary events in this patient one may not rule out the possibility that the underlying medical condition might have made the patient more vulnerable to the hypoxia- and cytokine storm-induced cardiac ischemia 32 moreover post-mortem examinations showed moderate pericardial effusion with light yellow and clear liquid and mild epicardial edema indicative of myocardial inflammation further suggesting that a peri-cardiac inflammatory response contributes to the myocardial dysfunction in covid-19 patients in a pilot study xu et al 33 failed to find evidence of myocardial injury in a histopathologic case by autopsy in which there were only a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates without other substantial damage in the cardiac tissue this paradoxical result may be attributed to the small sample size and absent clinical evidence of myocardial injury in this case overall future research is needed to enroll more cases with definite clinical evidence of myocardial injury to further investigate histopathologic characteristics of covid-19-related myocardial injury the viral infection induces an excessive immune reaction in the host which in turn generates a cytokine storm comprising released by proinflammatory cytokines known to act on cardiovascular cells 3435 one of the protagonists in the cytokine storm is interleukin 6 il-6 which is produced and released by activated leukocytes and acts on a large number of cells and tissues il-6 promotes the differentiation and activation of b lymphocytes and stimulates the production of acute phase proteinsthe severity and lethality of covid-19 may be at least in part due to the viral injury to the myocardium and blood vessels this serves as a major challenge for successful management and care of covid-19 patients in an observational study of 52 critical sick adult covid-19 patients 19 patients suffered from acute myocardial injury and 9 of them 75 died 29 suggesting a higher mortality in covid-19 patients with cardiovascular complications analysis of covid-19 related death cases has confirmed that myocardial injury was one of the major causes of death in a review of 25 death cases with covid-19 xun et al found that the serum ctni were significantly increased in 18 cases and more covid-19 cases with heart injury than other organ injuries except for the lung zhang et al reported that 89 of 82 death cases were observed with myocardial injury which was second only to death cases with pulmonary injury 36 moreover in a study of 416 covid-19 patients myocardial injury was independently associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality 27 hence early myocardial injury in covid-19 leads to a poor prognosis in covid-19 patientssars-cov-2 may directly invade cardiomyocytes and subsequently result in viral myocarditis and corresponding injury structurally the sars-cov-2 particle has an ace2-binding domain 40 the virus binds to human ace2 with high affinity and uses it as an entry receptor to invade target cells cryo-electron microscopy reveals the structure of the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein in two distinct conformations along with inhibition of spike-mediated entry by sars-cov polyclonal antibodies providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and therapeutics although the main target is the epithelium of respiratory system the virus may use the ace2 path to invade cardiomyocytes directly as many cardiovascular cells express ace2 figure 2 sars-cov-2 may trigger ace2 activation and upregulate ace2 downstream signal transduction including the activation of ras-erkap-1 pathway 41 consequently this may induce myocardial inflammation and fibrosis and exacerbate cardiac dysfunctionas the cellular receptor for the entry of sars-cov-2 ace2 is a monocarboxylase highly expressed in cardiac tissue 42 and exhibits cardio-protective roles as a potent negative regulator of the reninangiotensin system ras by counterbalancing functions of ace 43 as a membrane protein it can also initiate outside-in signaling 44 sars-cov have been previously demonstrated to induce myocarditis in a ace2-dependent manner 45 the trimers of the sars-cov spike protein initially extends into a hydrophobic pocket of ace2 catalytic domain 46 which consequentially leads to the endocytosis of sars-cov particles and fusion of virus to cardiomyocytes with the help of type ii transmembrane serine proteases tmprss2 47 finally downregulating ace2 expression in cardiomyocytes 4849 when ras is over-activated further myocardial injury is a consequence in sars patients moreover downregulation of ace2 may be at least partly caused by the shedding of ace2 ectodomain mediated by tnf--converting enzyme tace in coupling with the production of tnf- a well-known pro-fibrotic and myocardial impairing factor 50 the binding between sars-cov spike protein and ace2 on the cardiomyocyte surface also triggers the ras-erkap-1 pathway and activates the c-c motif chemokine ligand 2 ccl2 a pro-fibrosis factor 41 the above theories are supported by an autopsy report of heart samples from sars patients in which the presence of sars-cov in the heart was associated with marked down-regulation of ace2 expression as well as a significant increase in macrophage infiltration and interstitial fibrosis verifying ace2 inhibition is involved in sars-cov-driven myocardial injury 49the specific cellular mechanism for sars-cov-2 invading and damaging cardiomyocytes has not been clearly demonstrated yet but it is probable that sars-cov-2 shares the similar mechanism with its relative sars-cov a recent study investigated ultrastructure of full-length human ace2 with cryo-em 51 indicating that sars-cov-2 also invaded host cells via spike protein trimers binding to an ace2 homodimer in addition the interface between the receptor binding domains of spike proteins on sars-cov-2 is quite similar to that between the sars-cov and ace2 furthermore the serine protease tmprss2 is also indispensable for the entry of sars-cov-2 52 given that the high similarity of cellular entry with that of sars-cov it is reasonable to speculate that sars-cov-2 interferes in ace2 expression in the same way however this needs to be verified in cardiomyocytes in the further studymyocardial oxygen supply is determined by coronary blood flow and its oxygen carrying capacity while myocardial oxygen demand is determined by systolic wall tension contractility and heart rate 53 this physiological mechanism may be involved in sars-cov-2-induced myocardial injury as is well-known pulmonary dysfunction is the primary insult of sars-cov-2 which induces hypoxemia hypotension and in some cases shock 2039 as a consequencet an insufficient oxygen supply may occur in multiple organs including the heart concomitantly myocardial oxygen demand is increased in virus-infection states as high metabolic rate induces an augmented burden on the myocardium 54 further causing the imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand along with disease progression this imbalance is increasingly aggravated which may result in myocardial injury in covid-2019 patients especially for those with cardiovascular disorders who have already exhausted myocardial reserve capacity on the supply side other systemic contributors may include in addition to hypoxia respiratory andor metabolic acidosis fluid or electrolyte disorders and an activated neuro-humoral system following severe infection may also lead to myocardial stunning and injury even inducing malignant arrhythmia and sudden deathprevious studies have confirmed that the immune abnormality is related to the pathogenesis of sars-cov infection 45 specifically cytokine storm an excessive and uncontrollable cytokines production in response to infection is suggested to be the main contributor as numerous studies have found that the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines eg interleukin-1 il-1 il-6 interferon- ifn- ifn inducible protein-10 ip-10 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1mcp-1 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor g-csf macrophage inflammatory protein-1 mip-1 tumor necrosis factor- tnf- are significantly increased in covid-19 patients associated with disease progression 5556 among so many cytokines il-6 serves as the core of cytokine storm given that il-6 not only amplifies cytokine storm by stimulating production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines but also results in vascular leakage interstitial edema 57 moreover il-6 has also been shown to weaken papillary muscle contraction which causes myocardial dysfunction 58 in addition ifn is also regarded as a marker of cytokine storm causing cell apoptosis through regulating jakstat1 axis and p38-mapk1 59 however anti-inflammatory cytokines such as il-4 and il-10 are also increased in covid-19 patients and their levels are also related to disease severity 5556 demonstrating the close relation between pro- and anti-inflammation cytokine storm is a clear contributor to covid-19-related myocardial injury demonstrated by a study that revealed that increased levels of il-6 were significantly associated with high hs-tni levels 26 a cardiac-selective biomarker of myocardial infarction and injury 37 further studies are needed to explore the cytokine expression in cardiomyocytes which will promote a better understanding for sars-cov-2-induced inflammation in cardiac tissueoverall direct infection through ace2 the imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand and the abnormal immune response constitute the most plausible explanations for myocardial injury associated with covid-19 to be noted however the above speculation is mostly based on clinical observation of covid-19 therefore more in-depth research is required to understand the pathophysiology of sars-cov-2-induced myocardial injury in order to contribute to the future development of effective treatmentthe general clinical symptoms found in covid-19 patients with cardiac dysfunction are similar to those observed in influenza such as fever 879 cough 677 fatigue 381  expectoration 334 39 additionally confirmed cases of covid-19 show several more-specific symptoms such as anosmia dysgeusia chest pain 2638 and palpitation 60 electro physiologically covid-19 patients are prone to the development of arrhythmia especially tachycardia indicative for myocardial injury in a study of 138 covid-19 patients 23 patients 167 presented with arrhythmia and other evidence for myocardial injury 12 indeed the covid-19 patients with tachycardia were often in severe or critical situations for a better understanding of the etiology of cardiac dysfunction in patients with covid-19 researchers analyzed body temperature in different groups mild light severe and critical groups given the fact that high fever caused by the virus infection and inflammation can elevate the heart rate the result showed that there was no significant difference in the body temperature correlation with arrhythmia between the mild and severecritical groups many covid-19 patients with tachycardia are severely ill and need critical care as tachycardia represents a sign of a failing heart 30with regard to the imaging features of cardiac injury the epicardial adipose tissue eat density a measurement for inflammation between the bifurcation of pulmonary artery and diaphragm as determined by lung ct scan may serve as a specific indicator for covid-19-induced myocardial injury hui et al reported that the mean eat density of criticalsevere groups in chest ct scan were significantly lower than patients in the lightmild groups -9877 -9608 hu vs -6937-8476 hu suggesting that myocardial inflammation occurred in covid-19 patients 30 as the cytokine storm and consequent inflammatory response are suggested to be the mechanisms contributing to myocardial injury low eat density showed in chest ct scan appears to be a high-risk factor for myocardial injury however low eat density is not the optimal imaging parameter of covid-19-related myocardial injury since it is an indirect sign of inflammation and may be substantively influenced by subjective factors in clinical practice other imaging modalities with high sensitivity and specificity such as echocardiography and myocardial magnetic resonance imaging should be preferentially chosen if appropriatetreatment of covid-19 has been mostly restricted to supportive measures as there has been to date no specific therapy available to treat this disease pre-existing poor-health conditions increase the risk of cardiovascular comorbidity with poorer prognosis patients at age above 60 years old and those with diabetes are more susceptible to covid-19 induced myocardial injury they should be prioritized for treatment in terms of diagnostic criteria the dynamic change of myocardial biomarkers especially hs-tni is the main criteria to identify covid-19 patients with myocardial injury however the levels of myocardial biomarkers may be affected by other factors such as the status of infection hypoxemia and renal insufficiency which are commonly observed in covid-19 patients thus comprehensive assessments combining electrocardiography imaging and histopathology should be performed in clinical practicesince the outbreak of covid-19 several anti-virus agents have been proposed and currently are under intensive clinical investigation remdesivir is a broad-spectrum investigational antiviral agent which decreased sars-cov-2 rna transcription with in vitro experiments 61 the agent was originally developed for treating ebola virus infection but was not shown to have satisfactory efficacy in clinical trials 62 a few covid-19 patients recovered soon after administering remdesivir 6364 though its safety and efficacy have not been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials rcts 65 66 67 another antiviral treatment lopinavirritonavir the protease inhibitor combination used in hiv was previously given great expectation for treating covid-19 but failed to show significant benefit in the first rct other antiviral agents are now in rcts after showing some promise with small numbers of patients during the initial wave of covid-19 infections in chinahydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are traditional anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drugs they have been shown to control the sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 6168 the underlying mechanism may involve the increase in the endosomal ph required for viruscell fusion interference with the glycosylation of ace2 69 and inactivation of il-6 and tnf- 70 a small sample size study showed that hydroxychloroquine treatment was significantly associated with viral load reductiondisappearance in covid-19 patients 71 but this conclusion still has not been verified by ongoing rcts 7273 the cardiotoxicity of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine should not be neglected they may prolong qt interval and induce ventricular arrhythmia 74 thus they should be used very cautiously if at all to treat covid-19 patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or uncorrected electrolyte disorder given the pivotal role of immunologic overresponse in covid-19 anti-inflammatory therapy is also promising for treating covid-19 corticosteroids were used during the sarv-cov and mers-cov outbreaks and have also been used for patients with covid-19 however previous studies on whether corticosteroids exert protective 7576 or adverse 77 effect in sarv-cov and mers-cov infection came to conflicting conclusions since it might induce in-hospital secondary infection and long-term complications while inhibiting inflammation-related organ injury with lack of conclusive evidence the use of corticosteroids may be prudently considered in critical covid-19 patients with clear evidence of immune overreaction but their use is not generally recommended by the world health organization who or centers for disease control cdc some have advocated against non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents nsaids notably ibruprofen which may be associated with worse outcome with covid-19 based on anecdotal reports targeted agents such as tocilizumab are also regarded as potential therapy tocilizumab was shown to facilitate chimeric antigen receptor-t cell car-t therapy because it can inhibit il-6 the core cytokine of cytokine storm syndrome 78 several clinical observations demonstrated a predominant increase of il-6 in covid-19 patients which is associated with severe conditions 3879 so inhibiting il-6 activation may ease the overreacting immune system future well-designed rcts are expected to clarify tocilizumabs efficiency and its applicable patientsthe structural evidence of sars-cov-2 invasion of cells via ace2 has led to the hypothesis that aceiarb treatment potentially induces overexpression of ace2 which subsequently increases the susceptibility of host cells to sars-cov-2 invasion and the risk of infection or worsening the severity of disease 80 for cardiovascular patients under regular anti-hypertensive treatment it has been suggested that they should discontinue ace inhibitors acei or angiotensin receptor blocker arb medications however aceiarb play a protective role in covid-19 given that ace2 shedding caused by sars-cov-2 invasion may result in its downregulation following the activation of ras axis which is partly responsible for severe organ injury in covid-19 48 thus far there have been no clinical data supporting the case for aceiarb discontinuation in covid-19 patients according to whos guideline changing the routine antihypertensive therapy under the covid-19 pandemic to avoid potential harm or pursue potential benefits is not recommended before any compelling evidence publishedother therapies with less evidence-based foundation are also worth mentioning plasma treatment means transfusing convalescent plasma containing anti-virus polyclonal antibodies and were proved to be effective in treating sars patients and covid-19 patients in observational studies 8182 although the number of patients so treated is small this does make scientific sense dilated horse anti-sars-cov-2 serum could cross-neutralize sars-cov-2 in an in vitro study 8 some traditional herbal therapies against coronavirus infection were found to be effective during sars outbreak and are widely used in current practice in china 83 mesenchymal stem cell transplantation has shown both efficiency and safety in treating ards 84 all the above therapies need more verification by rcts 85 86 87 88 89 due to the widespread cardiac injury in covid-19 patients new or worsening heart failure is common especially in those with poor prognosis 79 after recognizing the onset of heart failure causes leading to decompensation should be evaluated first especially those should which could be managed and corrected immediately such as acute coronary syndrome and severe rapid arrhythmias hypoxemia following pneumonia and ards is common in covid-19 patients and will be worsened by heart failure thus oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation should be more rigorously used in covid-19 patients with heart failure than those without diuretics should be considered under the evidence of volume overload as well as renal replacement therapy which can simultaneously eliminate excessive cytokines rehydration should be more prudently prescribed in shock patients with covid-19 than normal shock counterparts considering that pulmonary edema following rapid fluid resuscitation will further impair alveolar ventilation mechanical assist devices such as intra-aortic balloon pump and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo may help patients get through critical periods and should be considered when necessarycovid-19 causes not only pulmonary injury but also severe cardiac complications in particular in those with pre-existing medical conditions although the precise mechanism for the development of myocardial injury associated with covid-19 is not fully understood a combination of direct and indirect pathogenic factors such as ace2-mediated sars-cov-2 infection of cardiomyocytes hypoxia and cytokine storm may contribute to the development of myocardial injury and other adverse events which aggravate conditions and increase mortality table 3
 close and careful monitoring of cardiac function should be emphasized in order to early identify covid-19-related myocardial injuryall the co-authors have no conflict of interest to be declaredthe covid-19 pandemic is a threat that has caused panic at the global level as of 21 june 2020 8 708 008 cases were confirmed worldwide resulting in 461 715 deaths1 infected patients presented predominantly with fever and cough as well as dyspnoea and myalgia24 a meta-analysis4 concluded that among the patients 328 presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 203 were transferred to the intensive care unit icu and 139 died according to our previous research3 patients with ards accounted for 661 of patients with covid-19 in the icu and the rates of non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation were 417 and 4722 respectively however no specific treatment is currently available because traditional antiviral drugs do not work well against covid-19 recent clinical trials exploring new therapies including remdesivir5 hydroxychloroquine6 and lopinavir-ritonavir7 for covid-19 had negative results therefore it is urgent to explore effective therapies considering the grim situationthe mechanism of covid-19 involves a cytokine storm which is a potentially fatal immune reaction triggered by a variety of factors including infections cytokine storms are associated with the clinical manifestation of severe inammation and highly elevated levels of proinammatory cytokines8 previous research9 suggested that cytokine storms may be the main mechanism of highly pathogenic human coronavirus infected pneumonia such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome as a member of the coronavirus family10 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 exhibits similar clinical features the clinical characteristics of covid-19 indicate that cytokine storms may be positively correlated with the severity of the disease2 11 12 moreover cytokines and t cell subsets may be indicators for predicting prognosis12 an immunopathology report12 speculated that interleukin il-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf were the main cytokines in the hyperinflammatory response caused by covid-19 while th1 cells were the key cells involved especially for patients transferred into icus the findings and speculations were verified by an autopsy study that confirmed that patients with critically ill covid-1913 had developed ards in addition they also found that the overactivation of t cells and the decrease in the cell counts may explain the occurrence of cytokine storms and to some degree the severe immune-medicated injury all these results indicated that decreasing cytokine storms and immunogenetic damage may be the main treatment option for critically ill patients with covid-19vitamin c vc a common and necessary nutrient is also an antioxidant in addition to its role in the metabolism of the human body including energy transformation collagen biosynthesis and repair adrenal steroid and catecholamine production iron absorption and so on1419 vc also possesses antimicrobial propertiesthus reducing the risk of infectionsand immunomodulatory functions particularly in high concentrations14 first vc plays a crucial role in immunomodulation it can inhibit the activation of nuclear factor kappa-b nfb which is a primary proinflammatory transcription factor and plays a pivotal role in overall immunity including the genetic regulation of chemokines cytokines adhesion molecules inflammatory mediators and apoptosis inhibitors20 vc can inhibit the production of il-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf-21 22 and this effect appears to be a dose dependent21 vc can reduce gm-csf signalling responses23 functioning as a regulator of cytokine redox-signal transduction in host defence cells and having a possible role in controlling inflammatory responses in addition high-dose vc can regulate the proliferation and function of t cells b cells and natural killer nk cells2427 this may help inhibit the progression of cytokine storms and improve the hosts immunity second previous studies22 demonstrated that vc can inhibit oxidative stress an important part of the innate immune response to viral respiratory infection28 29 and contributes to lung injury and barrier dysfunction28 oxidative stress may also play a role in the mechanism of covid-1929 it has been reported that vc can repair oxidative damage in human bronchial epithelium by modulating reactive oxygen species ros generation and inflammatory expression30 and can prevent ros-induced lung damage31 third vc can regulate alveolar fluid clearance by enhancing lung epithelial barrier function through epigenetic and transcriptional enhancement of protein channels that regulate alveolar fluid clearance32 33 vc may help decrease the symptoms of ards and improve respiratory function fourth vc may have antiviral effects vc has been reported to inhibit the replication of herpes simplex virus 1 poliovirus type 1 and influenza a virus in vitro34previous research35 demonstrated that intravenous vc ivc can achieve a higher plasma concentration than oral vc due to losses during intestinal absorption tissue transport and renal reabsorption the efficacy and safety of intravenous high-dose vc hivc in critically ill patients have been investigated via several clinical trials a recent meta-analysis15 of mostly cardiac surgery trials revealed that vc shortened icu length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation in icu patients in addition the effect of vc was significantly greater for patients with more severe illness15 36 regarding patients with sepsis or ards a phase i trial of ivc in patients with severe sepsis37 reported that vc significantly reduced multiorgan failure scores and circulating injury biomarker levels notably the effect appeared greater in the high-dose group 200 mgkg than in the low-dose group 50 mgkg however another study conducted on patients with sepsis and ards38 reported no difference in the primary outcome of organ failure scores and inflammation biomarkers but found a significant reduction in 28-day mortality and long-term prognosis this study applied 50 mgkg vc intravenously at a late stage when patients were undergoing mechanical ventilation in addition there was also a case report39 that administered hivc 200 mgkg to successfully treat virus-induced ards with patients making a rapid recovery after receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and without any long-term sequelaea major concern regarding the use of high-dose vc is its potential side effects many reported side effects of high-dose vc are insignificant and rare and of little consequence40 it was reported that high-dose vc was related to haemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase g-6-pd deficiency acute kidney injury aki and acute oxalate nephropathy4144 however adverse effects were mostly reported in a few cases and were related to too large of doses4144 non-standard administration43 or high-risk underlying diseases44 clinical trials with large sample sizes conducted on icu patients15 3638 reported few adverse events aes in addition a survey45 also indicated that other than the known complications of kidney damage and g-6-pd deficiency hivc appeared to be remarkably safe for patients with haemochromatosis g-6-pd deficiency renal dysfunction renal stones or oxaluria vc should be carefully administered adequate hydration appropriate dilution and slow infusion rates are recommended for hivc46thus we hypothesise that administering hivc at an early stage of ards in covid-19 would result in better outcomes in this trial we will tentatively explore the safety and efficacy of hivc used in covid-19the main goal is to investigate a new potential therapy for covid-19 by clarifying the effect of hivc on the prognosis of patients with covid-19 especially on respiratory function assessed by ventilation-free daysthis protocol was written in accordance with the standard protocol items recommendations for interventional trials guidelines47 see attached research checklist the protocol is summarised in figures 1 and 2the study is a multicentre prospective randomised placebo-controlled trial it is an interventional study with two arms vc group and placebo group the study is well designed according to the concept of a pragmatic trial48 with broad inclusion criteria a reasonable sample size and study procedures embedded into clinical routine care and executed by clinical personnelthe trial is being conducted in the icu of zhongnan hospital of wuhan university and the icu of leishenshan hospital of wuhan city from 14 february 2020 to 30 september 2020 zhongnan hospital of wuhan university with a comprehensive 66-bed icu is a tertiary hospital integrating clinical care scientific research and teaching during the covid-19 pandemic it took charge of leishenshan hospital of wuhan city the second specialised hospital that was built by wuhan government within half a month to only accommodate and treat patients with covid-19 each icu will enrol patients competitively for 8 monthspatients admitted into the above 2 icus consistent with the following inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria at the time of randomisation will be considered for enrolment enrolment must be completed within 12 hours after patients are admitted to the icuparticipants inclusion criteria are as followsexclusion criteria are as followsas mentioned above this trial is considered to be safe first vc is an essential nutrient for the human body and ivc has been widely used in clinical practice for over five decades50 second patients with greater potential risks of side effects were excluded based on the exclusion criteria third the rate of infusion is as slow as 12 mlhour however aes and serious adverse events saes must be observed and followed in accordance with the good clinical practice guidelines issued by the national medical products administration of the peoples republic of china51 an ae refers to any untoward medical event that occurs after a human subject receives a drug saes include prolonged hospital length of stay disability death and so on aes and saes will be recorded during the 28 days of observation from enrolment either may occur during a subjects participation in the research and do not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment investigators will evaluate the relationship between the events and the intervention and report it to the ethical committee and data and safety monitoring board dsmb benefits and potential risks are written in the informed consent document patients will be informed of the purpose intervention benefits and possible risks of the studyeach icu is assigned an independent random numeric table that is generated by the primary investigator alone through microsoft excel 2019 and carried out by other investigators each table has equal numbers of 1 and 2 which represent the placebo group sterile water for injection and treatment group vc respectively once generated the list will remain unchanged and be kept by the primary investigator who does not participate in the treatment of patients when a patient is transferred to the icu and meets the enrolment criteria the clinician on duty will inform the other investigators and obtain a number from the list according to the chronological order of icu recruitment then participants are enrolled in the corresponding group this trial is not completely blinded the covid-19 pandemic is a public health emergency that overwhelms the medical system thus there is not enough manpower and material resources to implement the double-blind method which requires modifying the medical orders system connecting the ward and the pharmacy and assigning a special nurse to configure and label infusions therefore the grouping and intervention are unknown to the participants and investigators responsible for data collection and statistical analysis but are known to the clinical staff and investigators responsible for recruiting participants vc injection and sterile water for injection are both colourless and transparent liquids and will be contained in the same brown syringes with different marks and without explanations on the syringe to make sure that patients cannot distinguish the treatment they receive investigators clinicians and dsmb will monitor the whole process of treatment and determine whether to continue the trial if potential aes occur or if it is in the participants best interests to stop treatment so there is no need for unblinding of the study groupingthis trial is an interventional study with two arms the intervention lasted for 7 days for the treatment group 12 g vc will be diluted in sterile water to a total volume of 50 ml and will be infused within 4 hours by an infusion pump this treatment will be repeated every 12 hours thus the total dosage of vc for the treatment group is 24 g per day the control group is assigned a placebo 50 ml sterile water the method and speed of administration are identical to those of the treatment group sterile water is used for dilution fluid as well as placebo fluid as the combination of vc and saline has been reported to irritate the vein52 no other medications or therapeutic schedules other than standard critical supportive care will be applied in this study the intervention should be commenced within 12 hours after enrolment delivery of the assigned vc injection or placebo injection is achieved through the medical orders system pharmacy supply and clinical routine in hospitals vc injection is a common and basic drug and has been widely used in the hospital so there will not be problems of inventory and logisticsbaseline data including demographic characteristics main

for a follow-up visit on the 28th day to track their long-term prognosis and sequelaeall the data will be collected from the clinical information system of the hospital and recorded in the case report format crf every participant will be distinguished with a study identifier and initial without full name an electronic password-protected document containing all the information from the crfs will be set up for statistical analysis the analysis process will be performed by the primary investigator and designated teammates who are experienced with trial crfs relevant documents will be stored at the department of critical care medicine of zhongnan hospital of wuhan university after the study the confidentiality and safety of participants data are guaranteed all the data will be reserved for 10 years for the purpose of further analysis and investigationthe primary outcome of this study is ventilator-free days in the 28 days since admission to the icusecondary outcomes include the followingsince the covid-19 pandemic is uncertain and unpredictable the sample size is calculated in two stages which is set to adjust statistical power and determine whether there is a promising trend at the first stage as no data from covid-19 regarding our primary outcome are available icu mortality 1357 reported by the who on 12 february55 was chosen instead for the calculation of sample size through a non-inferiority test to maximise the possibility of significant results with an allowable error of 10 a total of 308 study participants 154 in each group would result in a power of 80 with a one-sided type 1 error rate  of 25 allowing a 10 withdrawal rate in each group of course this calculated sample size is not accurate and needs revision based on the real situation thus we arranged a second-stage calculation after 50 patients are enrolled and have completed follow-up interim analysis will be conducted at the second stage and the required sample size will be recalculated during interim analysis the data of these 50 patients will be used and processed according to the following methods the results of the analysis will be reported to the dsmbmeasurement data will be described as the mean with sd or median with iqr according to its distribution count data will be represented as frequencies and proportions for univariate analysis the difference in measurement data will be compared between the vc and placebo groups using t-testmann-whitney u test 2 test and fishers exact test will be used for rate comparisons a mixed linear model will be used to assess the effect of treatment on outcomes and to fit a repeated-measures analysis of variance kaplan-meier analysis with the wilcoxon test will be used to show the effect of vc on patient survival probability the testing will be two sided and a p value 005 will be considered statistically significant spss v220 and graphpad prism v600 will be used to complete data processing and statistical analysisto describe the patients baseline characteristics ensure no differences in distribution and eliminate the confounding factors the primary analysis will be an intention-to-treat comparison of the general characteristics sex age race group assignment principle diagnosis and so on and other random effects the secondary analysis will be a comparison of the primary outcome and secondary outcomes between the treatment group and the control group the statistical methods mentioned above will be applied according to the characteristics and distribution of the dataif the number of enrolled patients permits no fewer than five patients in each subgroup of interest stratified analyses will be carried out in the following subgroups to further clarify the suitable population for administering hivcfor every patient the days of mechanical ventilation and ventilator parameters will be recorded in the medical record system thus data on the primary outcome is very unlikely to be missing secondary outcome data might be missing due to record-keeping errors multiple imputation methods including mean completer hot-deck imputation and regression will be used to minimise the effect of missing data as much as possible the data of patients with complete outcomes after conservative imputation will be included in the comparison between the treatment and control groupsan independent dsmb comprised of two academic intensivists outside the study who are experienced in conducting clinical trials in critical illness is monitoring the progress and safety of the trial the dsmb is able to pause the trial to investigate or give suggestions on potential safety issues to improve the study design and implementationprevious reports revealed that cytokine storms which can be suppressed by vc are believed to be the main mechanism in the deterioration of patients with covid-199 1113 vc traditionally considered a dietary supplement has antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties hivc has been proven to be safe and therapeutic in critical care medicine primarily as an adjunct to the treatment of septic shock and multiple organ failure where it has been shown to improve outcomes and reduce mortality15 3639 high-dose vc therapy lacks a universal definition a previous meta-analysis56 considered high doses as equal to or greater than 10 gday twenty-four grams of vc in this trial is higher than the dosage of vc in previous clinical trials conducted on critically ill patients with severe infection37 38to our knowledge this is one of the first prospective randomised controlled studies of high-dose intravenous vc treatment for covid-19 specific treatments for covid-19 are not available at present there are several clinical trials exploring immunotherapy10 documenting efficacy for any of these approaches requires time adequate patient numbers and careful analysis vaccine development will require even more time for both safety and efficacy testing although blood plasma treatment for critical patients with covid-19 was recommended by the national and health commission of the peoples republic of china plasma from recovered patients is a rare resource compared with these therapies hivc has great advantages in terms of stability availability safety and cost therefore this trial is highly meaningful as it could potentially save lives at a low price hivc is expected to improve pulmonary function and reduce mortality for patients with covid-19 furthermore it may also provide a basis and reference for hivc treatment of other diseases with similar mechanismshowever there are also limitations to our study design and uncertainties during implementation first as sars-cov-2 is a novel coronavirus the duration and distribution of infected cases are unpredictable geographically and temporally so the number of recruited patients at some clinical centres may be low thus competitive enrolment and multiple clinical trial centres are needed to ensure an adequate number of subjects second complete blinding is not feasible due to the lack of available resources such as placebos in the same package as vc the study is unblinded for dosing nurses attending physicians and investigators in charge of enrolling participants but blinding will be maintained for patients and all other members of the clinical and research team such as statistical staff to minimise bias third some patients may have received non-specific tentative and explorative symptomatic treatment such as interferon and traditional chinese medicine as there is no effective and standardised guideline for treating covid-19 at the early stage despite the national and health commission recommendations for the diagnosis and management of covid-1949 which continues to be updated these therapies are expected to be effective but they may act as confounding factors for the trial and it must be taken into account for data analysispatient recruitment started on 14 february 2020 and will be completed on 30 september 2020the novel coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 was already shown to induce a systemic inflammatory response which is accompanied by an excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokinesfurthermore covid-19 is commonly accompanied by hemodynamic abnormalities such as an increased coagulation activity increasing the risk for venous thromboembolic eventsin our short communication we focus on the relation of cytokines and chemokines release and the influence of coagulation factors on the inflammatory response of peripheral mononuclear blood cells pbmcsafter 24 h of incubation time 20 serum was the main trigger for the release of several cytokines and chemokines in comparison to heparinized plasma furthermore it was shown that the addition of fibrin to the pbmcs resulted in a significant increase of the cytokines and chemokines measured in a dose-dependent manneranti-coagulation could constitute a potential tool to handle and treat the circle between inflammation and thrombosis in covid-19 reducing a profound cytokine storm and thrombotic complicationsin december 2019 the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 emerged causing coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 sars-cov-2 was found to infect lung alveolar cells cardiac myocytes vascular epithelial and endothelial cells as well as inflammatory cells including macrophages monocytes and lymphocytes 1 2 this phenomenon is primarily due to the virus portal of entry the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor which is highly expressed in vascular tissues 3 consequently endothelial injury is a crucial indicator of sars-cov-2 infection 2 clinically the disease manifests with symptoms including fever cough dyspnea and myalgia the infection mortality rate is a subject to debate but likely higher than for seasonal influenza 4 the higher risk of mortality is primarily due to the risk for severe illnesses such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome septic shock multi-organ involvement and most notably acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 5 there is also increasing evidence that covid-19 differs from classic ards with regards to respiratory characteristics and optimal ventilatory management 6generally acute inflammation intravascular coagulation and platelet activation characterize ards in covid-19 patients excessive cytokine release and cytokine storm have been reported in response to sars-cov-2 infection in particular vast amounts of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 il-6 are released although whether il-6 is foremost a marker for the severe illness or the diseases mediator itself is still unknown yet its levels in circulation seem to correlate with disease severity and the propensity for a pro-coagulant status in addition to il-6 also higher levels of il-1 il-2 il-4 il-7 il-10 interferon-gamma ifn- if--induced protein 10 ip-10 tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf- granulocyte-colony stimulating factor macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha and myocyte chemotactic protein mcp-1 as well as c-reactive protein crp and d-dimer have been found in circulation this cytokine storm may also seem to correlate with the severity of disease or mortality 7 due to the lack of not only an appropriate vaccine but also effective antiviral treatment to sars-cov-2 anti-cytokine therapies targeting il-6 or il-1 have been proposed to serve as a potential therapy against the ongoing cytokine storm 5 8 the il-6 inhibitor tocilizumab is currently under investigation to serve as a treatment option for covid-19 5 8furthermore recent studies revealed that sars-cov-2 infections are commonly accompanied by hemostatic abnormalities such as elevated coagulation activity leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation dic 9 complement activation is one initiating pathway responsible for the innate immune responses that promotes inflammation and often defends against bacteria and virus infections furthermore the complement system and the coagulation cascade are closely linked which may provoke hypercoagulability and thrombosis excessive activation of the complement system is therefore associated with several pathologic events such as thrombotic microangiopathy and organ dysfunction fig 1 it has already been described that patients with sars-cov-2 infections exhibit a higher risk for venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism the clinical parameters of patients suffering from severe covid-19 correlate with an excessive complement activity high lactate dehydrogenase d-dimer and bilirubin concerning this increased levels of d-dimer were shown to serve as a particularly important marker for coagulopathy 10 and pulmonary embolism 11 additionally an in vitro study in which vero cells were infected with a sars-associated cov has outlined the potential of heparin to inhibit the infection by 50 12 in vivo heparin has already proven to significantly lower the rate of mortality due to sars-cov-2 infection 13 consequently there is evidence suggesting a link between the coagulation pathway and the inflammatory responseto prove this assumption we performed an in vitro study to investigate the potential of an activated coagulation cascade or clotting factors to trigger the expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines human peripheral mononuclear blood cells pbmcs from healthy volunteers n  7 were treated with either autologous serum or heparinized plasma respectively as in serum the coagulation cascade has already been progressed to a final state the addition of autologous serum used to clarify the influence of the coagulation factors released into serum on the pbmcs on the contrary in heparinized plasma the coagulation cascade is inhibited due to the presence of heparin presenting a hypocoagulable environment in addition to that the different doses of the coagulation factor fibrin sigma-aldrich usa were used to unveil the effect of this specific coagulation factor on cytokine expression and secretion cells were incubated at 37 c and 4 co2 at the different treatment conditions negative control autologous serum autologous heparinized plasma or fibrin for 0 h h 4 h or 24 h respectively supernatant cytokine and chemokine concentrations were measured using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits purchased from rd systems minneapolis mn usa human il-1 betail-1f2 duoset human il-6 duoset human il-8 cxcl8 duoset human ccl2mcp-1 duoset and human tnf-alpha duoset and human il-1ra the results were calculated in graphpad prism software graphpad-software la jolla ca usa due to non-gaussian approximation the results are given as median  interquartile range iqrour results revealed that the treatment of pbmcs with 20 autologous serum for 24 h in comparison to heparinized plasma led to the greatest inflammatory response outlined by the significant alteration of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the secretome in particular the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1 and il-6 were significantly elevated in the pbmcs supernatant rising from 00  00 pgml at baseline to 6646  15917 pgml p  002 after 24 h for il-1 and an il-6 concentration from 824  419 pgml at baseline to 83310  89860 pgml p  003 also tnf- and il-1ra were significantly altered by the treatment of pbmcs with autologous serum moreover the chemokine il-8 increased markedly from 666  661 pgml at baseline to 167760  206650 pgml at 24 h p  002 as it is the case for mcp-1 00  110 pgml at baseline to 19650  12800 pgml after 24 h p  0016 although the treatment of pbmcs by heparinized plasma resulted in a significant increment of supernatant il-8 and mcp-1 levels the increase was not as high as it is the case for autologous serum furthermore all cytokines and chemokines measured were markedly higher for serum than for heparinized plasma after 24 h see fig 2we analyzed the secretome of pbmcs treated with rising concentrations of fibrin 025 g 05 g 10 g 50 g 250 g and 500 g for 24 h our data unveiled a significant rise of il-6 tnf- and il-8 in a concentration-dependent manner the treatment of pbmcs with 500 g fibrin resulted in the greatest cytokine and chemokine values for instance il-6 supernatant levels rose from 1045  153 pgml at baseline to 40000  34610 pgml p  0008 due to the treatment with 500 g fibrin in addition to that the chemokine il-8 was significantly altered by the treatment with fibrin from 6404  90739 pgml to 174750  32720 pgml p  001 see fig 3 these in vitro results confirm the association of coagulation and the inflammatory response of the immune systemour data support the findings of yang et al 14 where plasma samples of patients infected with sars-cov-2 were examined and outlined an increase of 14 cytokines triggering inflammation in response to covid-19 there are many other evidence that the activation of coagulation has a marked impact on the cytokine-storm associated with the infection as recently reviewed in bikdeli et al 9 among others there are several hemostatic changes in response to sars-cov-2 infection including mild thrombocytopenia and increased d-dimer levels furthermore some case studies indicate an association between the severity of disease and a potential prolongation of prothrombin time and thrombin time as well as a shortened activated partial thromboplastin time concerning this our study confirms that coagulation may increase the inflammatory response eventually resulting in a feedback loop further triggering the hypercoagulable state although our data does not outline the reverse progress that inflammation may serve as a trigger for a hypercoagulable state it is already known that eg sepsis may be complicated by dic supporting our data and speculations a recent study by patel et al addressed the expression of inflammatory markers in sepsis an dic and could unveil a positive correlation of il-6 il-8 il-10 and tnf- with dic score 15in addition to that severe cases of covid-19 exhibit an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism vte a chinese study reported that 40 of covid-19 patients were highly prone to vte 16 also danzi et al 10 reported a case study that a woman infected with sars-cov-2 was hospitalized due to severe bilateral pneumonia ct scans have unveiled a severe pulmonary embolism although no predisposing factors for vte were known in addition patients with severe pneumonia due to covid-19 had a higher platelet count contributing to the increased risk of thrombosis 13 in a small case series a relation between covid-19 and large-vessel stroke was also proposed 17based on available in vitro data and first clinical impressions anti-coagulation could be a cornerstone in successfully managing covid-19 9 13 18 besides preventing thrombotic complications anti-coagulation could mitigate the vicious circle between inflammation and thrombosis in covid-19 therapeutic anti-coagulation might be warranted in critically sick covid-19 patients for non-severely ill covid-19 patients preventive anti-coagulation could reduce thrombotic complications and have the potential to help minimize the risk for full-blown cytokine storm although covid-19 patients could benefit from the treatment with anti-coagulants it is not yet proven that their usage would also reduce the inflammatory response due to sars-cov2 infection as far as the safety of the treatment with oral anticoagulants is concerned the risk for advanced bleeding of covid-19 patients has to be consideredparticulate matter pm air pollution concentrations frequently encountered in major cities can trigger the release of proinflammatory interleukins eg il-6 from alveolar macrophages promoting an acceleration of arterial thrombosis 1 analogously infection with the novel sars-cov-2 coronavirus can stimulate a too-little-too-late type-i interferon-mediated innate immune response which is inherently accompanied by dysregulated secretion of il-6 from alveolar macrophages 2 3 the so-called cytokine storm  involving overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and overactivation of immune cells hyperinflammation  ultimately drives an acute respiratory distress syndrome ards one of the leading causes of mortality in patients with severe covid-19 disease 4 5 intriguingly patients with severe covid-19 admitted to the intensive care unit are at highest thrombotic risk with acute pulmonary embolism being the most common thrombotic complication 6 the ability of covid-19 to predispose to thromboembolism which can fuel futile cycles of hyperinflammatory responses that aggravate sars-cov-2 pathogenesis 7 8 is increasingly viewed as a major factor in disease severity and mortality it is thus not surprising that long-term exposure to pm has been recently proposed as a key contributor to covid-19 mortality in the united states 9 likewise the elevated levels of pm air pollution in northern italy and central spain have been postulated as a putative risk factor underlying the extremely high covid-19 fatality rates observed in these european regions 1012the link between air pollution and covid-19 severity can be viewed merely as the passive result of a carrier action of virus particles by pm yet one should acknowledge that pm air pollution is also a principal cause of chronic systemic and airway inflammation ultimately leading to innate immune system hyperactivation elevated production of proinflammatory cytokines and thrombosis 1 10 1316 the physiopathological overlap between pm-driven inflammatory cytokine production and the cytokinethrombotic storm in patients with covid-19 might also suggest a boosting action of the former on the sars-cov-2 mechanism of disease figure 1 therapeutically if the chronic pulmonary effects of pm impact the prognosis of covid-19 it then follows that small molecules with acceptable risk profiles that can block the molecular triggers of il-6 release from alveolar macrophages in response to pm might also mitigate the aggressive proinflammatoryprothrombotic nature of covid-19 using sophisticated cell and mouse models a groundbreaking study by the budinger group established that the anti-diabetic drug metformin  through its capacity to inhibit mitochondrial complex i  suppressed the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species ros signaling necessary for the opening of ca2 release-activated ca2 crac channels in the generation of il-6 from alveolar macrophages upon exposure to pm figure 2 1 because the use a respiratory filter in people residing in areas with high levels of pm air pollution validated the causal link between pm exposure and levels of il-6-related systemic markers 17 these findings altogether support metformin use as a preventive strategy for the mortality attributable to pm air pollution worldwide 1 in the same line it would be relevant to test whether metformin could suppress the cytokine and thrombotic-like storms in covid-19 before they begin thereby lowering the risk of severe disease in high-risk individualssevere covid-19 illness and death is more common in people aged 60 and older with underlying conditions which can include chronic respiratory system disease not only due to chronic exposure to pm air pollution but also to immuno-senescence and inflamm-aging phenomena 1822 given the linkage between mitochondria functionality ion channels including crac and inflamm-aging 23 the ability of metformin to target mitochondrial electron transport and prevent roscrac-mediated il-6 release might illuminate a preventive and prophylactic measure to quell the raging of the cytokine and thrombotic-like storms that are the leading causes of covid-19 morbidity and mortality in older people such crac-related mechanism of action 24 capable of preventing systemically il-6-driven thrombotic events 1 together with the multi-faceted capacity of metformin to ameliorate immunometabolism-related inflammation and alleviate ards 2527 -which are believed to be the main risk factors for a worse outcome in the elderly with covid-19 28 29- could provide a novel mechanistic basis for the recently proposed geroprotective role of metformin against the gerophilic and gerolavic traits of sars-cov-2 infection 30previous randomized clinical trials and numerous retrospective observational studies have consistently associated metformin administration with significant improvement in risk factors of aging-related diseases cardiovascular neurodegenerative and cancer beyond type 2 diabetes 3133 research is now urgently needed to test whether metformin might additionally reduce the comorbidity infection rate severity and lethality of sars-cov-2 infection with special emphasis on the elderly risk groups accounting for the majority of severe covid-19 disease and fatalities to date clinical trial strategies such as the tame targeting aging with metformin study which plans to enroll 3000 older subjects ages 6579 without type 2 diabetes who will be randomly assigned to 1500 mg metformin daily or placebo for 4 years to measure time to a new occurrence of a composite outcome that includes cardiovascular events cancer dementia and mortality 31 33 provides an ideal opportunity to explore the recently proposed strategy of metformin as a low-cost geroprotector for prevention of sars-cov-2 30 in the meanwhile observational studies in residential care nursing homes and day-care centers where older adults at significant risk of covid-19 outbreaks are receiving metformin for treatment of type 2 diabetes along with the assessment of bronchialserological levels of inflammatory cytokines and markers of pro-thrombotichypercoagulable states such as d-dimers might provide a deeper comprehension of how metformin can protect and potentiate common preventive strategies such as distancing measures mask-wearing and hand-washingtargeting hyperinflammation in severe covid-19 patients may be critical for reducing mortality one might therefore wonder whether treatment with indirect eg metformin 1 or direct eg cm4620 34 small-molecule inhibitors of crac channels could improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with moderatesevere covid-19 cm4620-ie a potent and selective small molecule crac channel inhibitor that prevents channel overactivation and has demonstrated efficacy in patients with hypoxemia secondary to systemic inflammatory response syndrome in acute pancreatitis 34 will be trialed in patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia at risk for progressing to ards clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04345614 because a subset of severe covid-19 infections have a delayed onset of respiratory distress despite the severity of hypoxemia that clearly differs from classic ards but principally involves a catastrophic microvascular injury and thrombosis 3537 it might be relevant to carefully evaluate the impact of targeting the mitochondrial roscracil-6 signaling cascade in the respiratory inflammatory and survival outcomes during the typical and atypical presentation of ards in covid-19 patients nonetheless the findings from the clinical testing of crac-targeting drugs might link at a mechanistic level the metformin lessons on air pollution to ride out the cytokinethrombotic storm in severe sars-cov-2covid-19this perspective merely aims to stimulate new ideas as part of the global efforts aimed to develop new preventivetreatment strategies against the sars-cov-2covid-19 outbreak accordingly this perspective does not represent medical advice or therapeutic recommendations to either covid-19 patients or people at risk of sars-cov-2 infectioncovid-19 is a is a novel -coronavirus caused by infection with sars-cov-2 and is closely related to sars-cov it is the third zoonotic disease by coronavirus to affect humans following severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle-east respiratory syndrome mers 12the first cases of infection by this virus were reported in a shellfish market in south wuhan in december 2019 3 and it proved impossible to rule out human-human transmission sars-cov-2 samples were detected in this market but the infected animal species has not been definitively established at the time of writing 4 one study proposed that snakes were more likely than other animals to be carriers 5 but subsequent research indicated that bats may be responsible for its transmission given the close similarity 962 of genome sequence between sars-cov-2 in bats and humans 6 7 8 9the basic reproductive number r0 in china was reported to reach at least 221011 human-human transmission started among family members observing that 313  of infected individuals in this first wave resided in wuhan and that 723  did not live there but had contact with people who did 12 the mortality rate of the disease ranged between 22 and 284  and the mean age of non-survivors was 75 years 1314 the mean interval between initial symptoms and death was 14 days range 6 - 41 days and was shorter 115 days in patients aged 70 years 14the clinical manifestations of covid-19 appear after an incubation period of around 5-6 days and most frequently include fever coughing and fatigue with the possible onset of sputum production headache hemoptysis diarrhea dyspnea andor lymphopenia among others 1214 15 16 17 18 19 computed tomography images of patients with severe complications of covid-19 reveal the presence of pneumonia although with abnormal characteristics including rnaemia acute respiratory distress syndrome acute cardiac damage and evidence of pulmonary ground-glass opacities in some patients ground-glass opacities were detected in subpleural regions in both lungs which may lead to both systemic and localized immune responses exacerbating inflammation in some cases treatment with inhalers and interferon not only had no positive effects but also worsened the clinical symptoms with the progression of pulmonary opacities 1720 patients of advanced age and those with underlying conditions eg hypertension chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diabetes andor cardiovascular disease etc are at higher risk of a rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome septic shock metabolic acidosis coagulation dysfunction arrhythmia kidney damage heart failure liver dysfunction andor secondary infection often resulting in death 1719treatment options against this new disease are mainly limited to the mitigation of clinical symptoms especially those affecting the respiratory system including the application of oxygen therapy with the provision of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for patients with refractory hypoxemia treatments with hyperimmune plasma and immunoglobulin g have also been received by some critically ill patients 2122 while the administration of antivirals and corticosteroids is contraindicated 1923 remdesivir an adenosine nucleotide analog has proven effective in in vitro and animal studies and in one patient in the usa 2425 antiretrovirals used against the human immunodeficiency virus hiv such as lopinavirritonavir have also been found to reduce the viral load of sars-cov-2 26 chloroquine has also been proposed as a candidate drug for the treatment of covid-19 based on its immunomodulatory properties and capacity to suppress tumor necrosis factor  tnf- and interleukin-6 il-6 and to inhibit autophagy 2728 in general and especially in patients suffering from a cytokine storm clinicians should focus on the reduction of uncontrolled inflammation by blocking il-6 and tnf- or eliminating cytokines via hemoperfusion 29 table 1
 cytokine hyperproduction is often followed by edema gas exchange dysfunction acute respiratory syndrome acute cardiac damage and secondary infection 17with regard to the pathophysiological mechanism of the virus it enters the cell via angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace-2 mainly through the toll-like receptor-7 tlr-7 present in endosomes tlr-7 activation requires the production of tnf- il-12 and il-6 to enable the generation of specific cytotoxic cd8 t cells this involves the formation of antigen-specific b cells and antibody production through cd4 helper t cells 29the majority of patients infected with covid-19 have normal or reduced white cell counts and lymphocytopenia and those with severe disease have shown significantly elevated levels of neutrophils dimer-d and urea in blood with a continuing decrease in lymphocytes increases in certain cytokines and chemokines eg il-6 il-10 and tnf- have also been observed in these patients thus patients admitted to intensive care units icus have been found to have elevated serum levels of il-2 il-7 il-10 macrophage colony-stimulating factor m-csf granulocyte colony-stimulating factor g-csf granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor gm-csf 10 kd interferon-gamma-induced protein ip-10 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1- mip 1- and tnf- 173031 fig 1
it is essential to analyze the factors underlying the physiopathology of this pandemic disease and certain cytokines appear to play a key role the objective of this study was to review data on the cytokines that influence the progression of covid-19 in order to support efforts to manage this highly virulent diseaseil-1 actively participates in the inflammatory response to infection 39 and its main sources are activated monocytes and macrophages 44 sars-cov-2 appears to act on the activation and maturation of il-1 which in turn activates other proinflammatory cytokines such as il-6 and tnf- 45 46 47 hence il-1 forms part of the cytokine storm produced by coronavirus infections 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 yang et al detected elevated levels of the antagonistic receptor of il-1 il-1ra in 14 severe cases of covid-19 and this marker has been associated with increased viral load loss of pulmonary function lung damage and mortality risk 55 liu et al also found elevated il-1 levels in patients with severe covid-19 and these were strongly associated with lung injury 56 il-1 levels are related to the virulence of the process and significantly higher serum levels have been observed in sars-cov-2 cases with severe symptoms than in mild cases or in those infected with the 2003 sars-cov or 2012 mers coronavirus 57 most covid-19 patients with severe symptoms have elevated levels ofil-1 which has been associated with sars hypercoagulation and disseminated intravascular coagulation 58 for this reason some therapeutic strategies have used the inhibition of il-1 in an attempt to avoid the cytokine storm 5960 in this way mesenchymal stem cells mscs have been used to inhibit proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1 and tnf- 43il-2 plays a key role in the proliferation of t cells and in the generation of effector and memory t cells 61 it is involved in adaptive immunity and increases glucose metabolism to promote the proliferation and activation of t b and nk cells 39 hence il-2 participates in the prevention of autoimmune diseases and is essential to control immune responses and maintain self-tolerance 62 the absence of this interleukin has been associated with a poor control of effector cells and the consequent development of autoimmunity 63huang et al detected elevated levels of il-2 or its receptor il-2r in patients with covid-19 and it has been reported that these increases are directly proportional to the severity of the disease 17304352 53 5456576465 elevation of this interleukin and its association with disease severity have also been reported in patients with other types of coronavirus 66 67 68il-4 is also involved in adaptive immunity playing a crucial role in the immune regulation governed by activated t helper th cells it preferentially acts through activation proliferation and differentiation of b lymphocytes and promotion of the immunoglobulin e isotype it therefore decisively intervenes in the induction of humoral immunity-regulating th2 cells 3969it has been proposed that il-4 has an anti-inflammatory function that is specific to the tissue in which it is present reflecting the metabolic plasticity of different tissues 70 with respect to viral infections that target the respiratory system bot et al observed that its expression during infection with an influenza virus had negative effects on cd8 memory t cells 71various studies of covid-19 patients have detected elevated il-4 levels as part of the cytokine storm associated with severe respiratory symptoms 16174372il-6 is involved in inflammation the immune response and hematopoiesis 73 this pleiotropic biomolecule is secreted by multiple cell types and regulates a wide variety of physiological processes 74 during initial stages of inflammation secreted il-6 travels to the liver and induces a large number of acute-phase proteins including c-reactive protein crp serum amyloid a saa fibrinogen haptoglobin and 1-antitrypsin in addition il-6 has been found to diminish the production of fibronectin albumin and transferrin 75 it has been reported that it has regenerative and anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the conventional signaling process although it also exerts proinflammatory effects mediated by trans-signaling as in the case of viral infections 76in relation to the different types of coronavirus elevated il-6 levels have been observed in sars cases and related to the severity of symptoms 487778 and in sars-cov being implicated in possible t-cell dysfunctionality it has been observed that sars-cov-induced cytokines may damage the capacity of t cells in relation to dendritic cells compromising the viability of these cells and macrophages to eliminate the pathogen 4979 similar observations have been made in relation to mers 5080elevated il-6 levels have been found in patients with covid-19 and related to a poor prognosis 1631536581 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 wan et al detected elevated il-6 levels in one-third of patients with mild symptoms and three-quarters of those with severe symptoms concluding that il-6 alongside il-10 may be of prognostic value in patients with covid-19 54 among patients admitted to icu diao et al found an inverse proportional association between elevated il-6 levels and t cell counts 82 and another study of patients with severe symptoms described elevated serum levels of il-6 and crp 91 a study of 452 patients infected with sars-cov-2 also reported that the elevation of il-6 levels was more marked with more severe symptoms 57 these levels have been higher than those observed in patients with sars-cov or mers 7780 il-6 levels were also found to be markedly higher in patients who died from covid-19 than in those who recovered 92 as noted above activation of il-1 by sars-cov-2 in turn activates il-6 and tnf- 45 46 47 it has also been demonstrated that a high expression of il-6 in patients with covid-19 can accelerate the inflammatory process contributing to the cytokine storm and worsening the prognosis 93 the cytokine storm including elevated levels of il-6 has also been associated with cardiac damage in these patients 94with regard to the important role of il-6 in the sars-cov-2-induced cytokine storm and its evasion it has been reported that the monoclonal antibody tocilizumab acts by blocking the receptor of il-6 and has been reported to reverse cytokine hyperproduction 8495 96 97 inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis 9899 in fact a multicenter clinical trial is under way in china on the usefulness of tocilizumab to treat patients with covid-19 nct04252664  nct04257656 and it has already been included in clinical practice guidelines in china and italy 100101 the polyol myo-inositol was also described by bizzarri et al as a potential candidate drug to reduce il-6 levels and the risk of cytokine storm 102 in addition the capacity of the macrolide azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine to reduce nasopharyngeal levels of sars-cov-2 has been attributed to its capacity to block il-6 and tnf- 103104 chloroquine also has the capacity to inhibit il-6 and tnf- and is being tested against covid-19 104105 finally blood purification therapy has been proposed to eliminate pathological antibodies and il-6 among other cytokines given its successful application against other diseases 85il-7 plays an important role in lymphocyte differentiation participating in the development of t cells and peripheral homeostasis 106 all of the main cd4 t cell subgroups cd4 immature memory and th17 cells depend on this cytokine for peripheral homeostasis 107 108 109 110 il-7 activates t cells increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and negatively regulates transforming growth factor beta tgf- the role of this biomolecule depends on il-6 111 and it has been suggested that il-7 secretion can be induced by viral infections 112as in the case of other cytokines it has been reported that il-7 levels are elevated in patients with covid-19 and directly related to disease severity 175354il-10 is a type 2 cytokine that inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines eg ifn tnf il-1 and il-6 in various cell types and prevents dendritic cell maturation by blocking il-12 it hampers expression of the major histocompatibility complex and costimulatory molecules which have an important role in cell immunity however il-10 can have immunostimulatory effects including the stimulation of ifn production by cd8 t cells it is also a powerful factor for the growth and differentiation of b cells mast cells and thymocytes 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 numerous authors have described viruses epstein barr virus cytomegalovirus and herpesvirus that contain il-10 homologs which may contribute to the presentation of different binding profiles to receptors and biological activities that can increase viral resistance 72114120 121 122 123 124 125however il-10 regulation is decreased in infection with some viruses such as hiv contributing to t-cell depletion 126 127 128 animal studies have shown that the antibody-mediated inhibition of il-10 signaling improves the t-cell response and contributes to eliminating viral resistance hence the effective blocking of il-10 signaling may be useful against resistant viral infections 129130various authors have detected this interleukin in patients with covid-19 and related its levels to disease severity and progression as in the case of other cytokines 174357648283868889 and it has been reported to have possible prognostic value 54 in fact some authors indicate that il-10 may be hyper-expressed in anti-sars-cov-2 immunity being higher in patients of advanced age with respect to a hyperinflammatory response possibly related to the reduction of t-cell receptors in the elderly 131 as with other cytokines il-10 levels were found to be higher in patients with covid-19 than in those with sars-cov or mers 17il-12 is one of a group of heterodimeric biomolecules with distinctive characteristics including pairing versality also observed for il-23 il-27 and il-35 which are involved in molecular processes and functions with a crucial role in positive and negative feedback 132133 il is a proinflammatoryprostimulatory cytokine produced in response to microbial agents by dendritic cells b cells monocytes and macrophages among others it has key functions in the development of th1 and th17 cells 134 135 136 137 il-12 also induces the production of ifn- by t and nk cells in a positive feedback mechanism 138the action of this cytokine in viral infections is based on its direct chemotactic effects on the infiltration of nk cells increasing their binding to vascular endothelial cells nk cells secrete ifn- which participates in positive feedback by increasing the production of il-12 139140 viral infections rapidly induce the gene expression of il-12 which also acts after viral replication 141 142 143 for instance il-12 is endogenously induced during the pneumonia produced by influenza and activates nk cells which secrete ifn- and thereby inhibit viral replication il-12 has been found to produce some improvement in the response of cd8  t cells 140elevated serum il-12 levels have been observed in patients infected with sars-cov-2 161743 and in those infected with other coronaviruses such as sars-cov 77mscs inhibit the secretion of il-12 as well as ifn- and tnf- and have been proposed as an effective therapy against covid-19 144145il-13 is secreted by activated th2 cells constituting a counter-regulatory system for the th1-type immune response it is considered an important regulator of immune responses mediated by th2-type cytokines 146 il-13 has varied functions and has been implicated in the development of bronchial asthma by inducing the production of tgf- eotaxin-3 and mucin 147 148 149 150 it also participates in the activation of mast cells de vries je 1996 both il-13 and il-4 are involved in allergic processes asthma and the regulation of th2 lymphocytes 151 il-13 mediates tissue responses to infections including the mobilization of eosinophils and the expulsion of parasites 152few data are available on the presence of il-13 in patients with covid-19 huang et al found no difference in serum il-13 levels between those requiring icu admission and those who did not 17 however liu et al observed a directly proportional association between il-13 levels and the viral load of sars-cov-2 56il-17 is synthetized by th17 lymphocytes and is elevated in inflammatory processes and autoimmune diseases 153 154 155 156 it is also produced by cd8 cells and by various sets of immature lymphocytes including gamma-delta t cells nk cells and group 3 innate lymphoid cells 157 il-17 alongside il-22 and tnf- also induces the production of antimicrobial peptides 158 hence il-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a role in tissue damage physiological stress and infection these functions vary according to the tissue in which il-17 is expressed being particularly important in the gastrointestinal tract and skin 159160elevated il-17 levels have been reported in patients with sars-cov-2 as part of the cytokine storm 17 and they have been associated with the viral load and disease severity 56 in contrast wan et al found that il-17 levels were normal in patients with covid-19 with no significant differences between patients with severe versus mild symptoms 54 elevated il-17 levels were previously described in patients with sars-cov or mers 161162 the fact that th17 cells can produce il-17 among others has led to proposals for a therapeutic approach to covid-19 focused on janus kinase 2 jak2 inhibitor named fedratinib this jak2 inhibitor decreases il-17 expression by th17 cells in murine models 163m-csf also known as colony-stimulating factor-1 is a primary growth factor that belongs to the family of colony-stimulating factors 164 it regulates the growth proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells including monoblasts promonocytes monocytes macrophages and osteoclasts it is secreted by various cell types including monocytes fibroblasts osteoblasts stromal cells endothelial cells and tumor cells the actions of m-csf are mediated by a type iii tyrosine-kinase receptor it requires the synergic action of il-1 and il-3 during the early differentiation of myeloid line cells while at subsequent stages it can directly control the proliferation and differentiation of mononuclear cells of the phagocytic system 165 m-csf expression increases during infectious processes augmenting the production of myeloid cells 166liu et al found significantly elevated levels of this factor in patients with covid-19 and associated the hyperexpression of this and other cytokines with lung damage which may assist in predicting disease severity 56g-csf is essential for the proliferation and maturation of polymorphonuclear granulocyte cells pmns preparing the organism for defense against invasion by certain pathogens the immunological functions of pmns in infections include chemotaxis phagocytosis and the release of lysosomal enzymes and other signaling molecules thus g-csf has hematopoietic growth factor properties and simultaneously functions as a mediator of anti-infectious and anti-inflammatory responses 167 it is the main determinant of the number of circulating neutrophils and is a key mediator in physiological responses that require the action of these cells increased levels of endogenous g-csf have been reported in infectious and traumatic processes and in patients with neutropenia or fever withwithout neutropenia g-csf levels have also been correlated with bacteremia by gram-negative organisms 168huang et al found that g-csf levels were elevated in patients with covid-19 and even higher in those requiring icu admission 17 this could lead the multiorgan failure related to severe cases 90169 wu d and yang xo 2020 associated g-csf levels with the response of th17 lymphocytes in patients with sars-cov-2 finding that the il-17 produced by these cells can induce the production of g-csf among others they also reported that th17 contributes to the cytokine storm triggered by sars-cov-2 163 liu et al directly related g-csf levels to the viral load of sars-cov-2 and the associated lung damage 56gm-csf is a heterodimeric complex that consists of a specific alpha chain of gm-csf and a signal transduction subunit shared with il-3 and il-5 receptors it is a single-membrane protein that homodimerizes after binding to g-csf 170 171 172 the main sources of this biomolecule are fibroblasts and endothelial epithelial stromal and hematopoietic cells 164 and it is secreted by epithelial cells in the lung 173174 unlike m-csf and g-csf gm-csf is virtually undetectable in the blood although it has been found to be locally produced and activated in tissues affected by inflammatory processes serum gm-csf levels can also be elevated in response to endotoxins hence gm-csf plays an important role in the inflammatory process 175 176 177 stimulating the proliferation and activation of macrophages eosinophils neutrophils monocytes dendritic cells and microglial cells besides its role as a hematopoietic growth factor this cytokine increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines favors antigenic presentation and phagocytosis and promotes chemotaxis and leukocyte adhesion it is of major importance in maintaining immune homeostasis in lung and gut 178elevated serum gm-csf levels have been detected during the acute phase of infection by sars-cov-2 in comparison to healthy individuals both in those who required icu admission and those who did not 17 th17 cells produce gm-csf and high th17 counts have been associated with elevated gm-csf levels 163 it has also been observed that the activation of th1 cells by pathogens generate gm-csf among other cytokines 93ip-10 was initially identified as a chemokine whose secretion is induced by ifn- ip-10 is secreted by neutrophils endothelial cells keratinocytes fibroblasts dendritic cells astrocytes and hepatocytes through its binding to chemokine receptor 3 cxcr3 it regulates immune system responses by activating and recruiting leukocytes including t cells monocytes and nk cells therefore ip-10 and cxcr3 play a key role in recruiting leukocytes to inflamed tissues and in perpetuating inflammation thereby making a major contribution to tissue damage 179 elevated ip-10 concentrations have been found in numerous infections mainly viral infections 180serum ip-10 levels were found to be elevated in patients with covid-19 and even higher in those who required icu admission suggesting their relationship with lung damage and disease severity 17 high levels of this biomolecule were previously found in patients with sars-cov 77 and the levels are even higher in those with sars-cov-2 81 thus the hyperproduction of ip-10 among others is considered to contribute to disease progression 17 liu et al associated elevated serum ip-10 levels with a higher viral load and greater lung damage in patients with sars-cov-2 56 yang et al also found especially high levels of this cytokine in the most severe cases of covid-19 and they associated ip-10 expression with disease progression and mortality alongside the expressions of monocyte chemotactic protein-3 mcp-3 and il-1ra 55ifn- is a type-ii ifn produced by a wide variety of lymphocyte cells including cd4 and cd8 t cells treg cells foxp3 cd8- t cells b cells and nk cells monocytes macrophages dendritic cells and neutrophil granulocytes can also produce this cytokine although numerous cells can be the source of ifn- it is mainly produced by t and nk cells mscs can also secrete low ifn- levels to regulate hematopoiesis 181 ifn- participates in numerous immune and adaptive immunological functions and in inflammatory processes it promotes macrophage activation and antigen presentation and is highly involved in anti-bacteria and anti-virus immunity and in signal transduction it is difficult to classify ifn- as a pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine given its complex and varied roles 182huang et al found that serum ifn- levels were higher in patients with covid-19 than in healthy individuals and proposed that the elevation of this and other cytokines might result from the activation of th1 and th2 cells also elevated serum ifn- levels were previously reported in patients with sars-cov or mers 1777183 liu et al 2020 observed that elevated ifn- levels were associated with greater viral load and lung damage 56 sun et al found that ifn- il-6 and il-10 levels were higher in patients with infection by sars-cov-2 but did not differ between patients who required icu admission and those who did not 88 in fact these authors found that levels of this cytokine were lower in cd4 t-cells from patients with severe versus mild symptoms and suggested that the infection may initially affect cd4 and cd8 t-cells reducing the production of ifn- 64this protein belongs the c-c chemokine family and is a powerful monocyte chemotactic factor that is constitutively produced or induced by oxidative stress cytokines or growth factors it can be expressed by endothelial cells fibroblasts epithelial cells smooth muscle cells mesangial cells astrocytes monocytes and microglial cells which play an important role in the antiviral response in the peripheral circulation and tissues monocytes and macrophages are the main source of mcp-1 which regulates the migration and infiltration of monocytes memory t cells and nk cells 184huang et al found that mcp-1 levels were higher in patients with covid-19 and even higher among those admitted to icu 17 it has been reported that mcp-1 increases rapidly in the early acute phase of infection and then progressively decreases with the advance of the disease 185 xiong et al detected elevated levels of mcp-1 and other cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with covid-19 and associated the pathogeny of the virus with these cytokines 186 elevated levels of this protein have also been detected in the lung tissue of patients infected with sars-cov-2 81tnf- is produced by various cell types such as monocytes macrophages and t cells among others this cytokine has been related to proinflammatory responses mediated by il-1 and il-6 alongside other cytokines tnf- is involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes infectious diseases and malignant tumors 187it has been observed that serum tnf- levels are elevated in patients with covid-19 and are higher with more severe disease 175764 diao et al reported similar results in a sample of 522 patients with covid-19 and found an inverse relationship between tnf- levels and t-cell counts 82 in contrast wan et al described normal tnf- levels in patients with covid-19 54 tnf- was one of the cytokines whose overproduction was related to a poor prognosis in patients with sars-cov and mers 48 49 50183 zhang et al proposed that the administration of certolizumab an anti-tnf- antibody might have beneficial effects on patients with covid-19 188 another possible therapeutic approach is to use mscs to inhibit tnf- and il-1 among other cytokines 145other biomolecules besides cytokines have shown increased expression in patients with covid-19 including growth factorsvegf is essential for vascular endothelial homeostasis and is present in numerous cells and tissues it has also been found to participate in the pathogenesis of tumor growth and metastasis vegf plays an essential role in endothelial cell activation by binding to cell surface receptors vegfr the integrity of the endothelial barrier in lung tissue is crucial for alveolar immune regulation severe inflammation and the associated immune responses induce the apoptosis of epithelial and endothelial cells increasing the production of vegf and exacerbating edema and the extravasation of immune cells 188 the pathogenic effects of this factor are related to its action on vascular permeability and neoangiogenesis 189190 vegf hyper-regulation is observed in various viral infections and attempts have been made to stimulate this factor by using vegf homologs present in some viruses or by activating inflammatory mediators that trigger the overexpression of vegf 189serum vegf levels were found to be higher in patients with sars-cov-2 although they did not differ between those who were admitted to icu and those who were not 17 as noted above the therapeutic application of mscs is under consideration due to their regenerative and immunomodulatory potential besides vegf mscs can also secrete vegf among others which would be useful in the approach to respiratory distress syndrome and in the regeneration of lung tissue and treatment of lung fibrosis induced by infections 145hepatocyte growth factor hgf is synthesized by fibroblasts and by endothelial and hepatic cells among other cell populations the active form is produced by the action of a serine protease enzyme released by damaged tissues in the lungs hgf is sequested by pulmonary fibroblasts and its secretion is increased when the tissue is damaged 191serum hgf and mip 1- levels were found to be elevated in patients with covid-19 and even higher mip 1- levels were found in those requiring icu admission 17the immunological reaction triggered by infection with sars-cov-2 mobilizes numerous cytokines mainly of proinflammatory character changes in their levels are associated with the presence of the disease and a more severe prognosis this study summarizes findings on the role of these cytokines in the onset and outcomes of sars-cov-2 infection and on possible therapeutic approaches involving the inhibition of their activitythe authors declare no competing or financial interestssevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a member of the family coronaviridae that like two other members of the family coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov causes respiratory disorders 1 2 the virus was first detected in wuhan china on december 2019 and the disease caused by the virus coronavirus disease covid-19 was characterized as a pandemic on 11 march 2020 by the world health organization who 3 4sars-cov-2 is an rna virus and has a variable number of open reading frames orf that can encode a number of structural proteins such as m matrix e envelope n nucleocapsid and s spike protein as well as a number of non-structural proteins among these structural proteins the s protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzymes 2 ace2 present on the surface of human cells especially the alveolar type ii cells that highly express this receptor and then the virus enters the host lung cells 5 6 effective immune responses against viral infections depend on ifn-i production from innate immune cells and subsequently cell mediated immunity through t helper 1 and cytotoxic t cells 5 so as the virus enters the cell its genome is recognized by various pattern recognition receptors prrs such as toll-like receptor-3 tlr-3 tlr7-9 retinoic acid-inducible gene-i rig-i melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5 mda5 and cyclic gmp-amp synthase cgas then signaling pathways are initiated following these incidences large amounts of type i interferons and inflammatory cytokines are secreted 7 8 9 10 following these inflammatory conditions in the lungs which also increase with the proliferation of the virus a sharp increase in inflammatory cytokines such as il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a and tnf have been reported in patients with covid known as the cytokine storm 11 this cytokine storm is similar to that seen in sars and mers and is caused by the lack of proper regulation of inflammatory immune responses 12 13clinical evidences demonstrated that this cytokine storm is the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in covid-19 5 12 13 14 pathogenic t cells produce inflammatory cytokines after activation and subsequently inflammatory monocytes and other leukocytes migrate to the lung 15 increased neutrophil counts have been reported as a symptom in a number of patients 2 these activated immune cells may cause pulmonary damage induced by inflammation resulting in complications such as pneumonia loss of lung function ards and even death fig 1
a 5 12 13 14 since ards is recognized as one of the leading causes of mortality in patients and appears to be caused by cytokine storm so suppression of this inflammation may cause decrease inflammatory cytokine production and consequently reduce inflammation and lung injury as has been shown the use of anti-il6 in patients with covid-19-induced pneumonia can be useful and has been approved in china 16 currently there is no approved treatment for sars-cov-2 and usually supportive treatments such as the use of ventilators and muscle relaxants were used for these patients 6 16 17 numerous therapeutic interventions have been performed to treat ards but since the mechanisms of damage in ards are complex and diverse it seems that therapeutic strategies that target a single pathway or mediator cannot be useful in achieving therapeutic outcome 17 therefore interventions that target several aspects of immunopathogenesis and associated injuries can be helpful to find the appropriate treatment strategynumerous infectious agents including bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae 
staphylococcus aureus 
hemophilus influenzae viruses sars-cov mers and sars-cov-2 fungi aspergillus species and cryptococcus species parasites pneumocystis jiroveci as well as non-infectious agents such as pancreatitis trauma etc can cause pneumonia and ards 18 one of the therapeutic approaches for treatment of ards is a mesenchymal stem cell msc therapy that previous studies have shown satisfactory results for this 19 20 21 22 23 24 mscs are the multipotent cells that can be obtained from different tissues such as adipose tissue and bone marrow these cells have the self-renewing capacity and can be differentiated into chondrogenic osteogenic and adipogenic lineages 25 several features of these cells have made them an appealing candidate for the treatment of many diseases including ardsimmunomodulatory properties mscs able to alter the function of the immune cells and modulate the immune response 17 for example in lps-induced ards animal models it has been shown that mscs suppress inflammation and reduce inflammation-induced lung injury through their immunomodulatory properties these cells affect the macrophages by releasing prostaglandin e2 pg-e2 and reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines and increase il-10 production il-10 reduced neutrophils recruitment to the lungs and attenuated inflammatory cytokine production 20 22 24 mscs can also increase regulatory t cells and alter the phenotype of macrophages to m2 macrophages 17tissue repair characteristic mscs also have the potential to repair tissue and can prevent apoptosis of the lung cells and regenerate them especially type ii alveolar cells by producing growth factors such as keratinocyte growth factor kgf vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and hepatocyte growth factor hgf this characteristic is important because people with ards develop pulmonary fibrosis even after surviving the acute phase of the disease 19 21 26 mscs can restore epithelial protein permeability by secretion of angiopoietin-1 these cells can increase phagocytosis capacity of the macrophages by transferring the microvesicles 17some studies shown that mscs could imply antiviral activity it was shown that gammaherpesvirus infected mscs could limit the replication of the virus after sensing its dna by cgas and initiation of the sting-tbk1 signaling pathway this pathway that is resulted in ifn- production along with ifn- independent manner could be responsible for the anti-viral response of the mscs 27 in addition some studies shown that ido which expressed by mscs could responsible for anti-viral activity of the mscs 28 29 30 ido-positive mscs triggered by inflammatory cytokines demonstrated antimicrobial effector function against pathogens such as viruses 28 in a study performed in 2011 it was shown that ifn- stimulated the expression of the ido in mscs and the replication of the cmv and hsv-1 were decreased 29
in summary it can be suggested that mscs can be attractive candidates for improving covid-19-induced ards and lung injury due to their immunomodulatory tissue repair and anti-viral characteristics fig 1bbut our suggestion is using mscs-derived exosomes because it has been shown that msc-derived exosomes apply the same effects of mscs 31 khatri et al performed an in vitro study and demonstrated that msc derived extracellular vesicles msc-evs transferred the mrnas and mirnas into the lung epithelial cells and reduced the apoptosis of these cells and inhibited influenza virus replication in them for the confirmation of the results they used a pig model of the influenza virus it was shown that after msc-evs administration the replication of the virus in the lung pro-inflammatory cytokines production and virus-induced lung lesion were significantly decreased 32 in a study performed in 2018 intravenous injection of msc-exosomes reduced the tnf- il-1 nf-b and matrix metallopeptidase 9 in the lung another study mentioned that these exosomes could decrease endothelial cell apoptosis and il-6 production an increase in il-10 production was also observed 33 in addition to this due to the specific structure of the exosomes mirnas as well as various drugs can be inserted into them then after administration of these exosomes they can be trapped in the lung tissue and reached to the target cells these mirnas or drugs can target the specific molecules inside the infected cells and diminish local inflammation or prevent apoptosis of the lung cells 34 in a song et al study it was showed that pretreatment of the mscs with il-1 augmented their immunomodulatory effects because their exosomes transfer of mir-146a to the target cells 35 other advantages of the exosomes include ease of access lack of problems associated to cell maintenance and injections proper size and finally the nature of their phospholipid membranes which enable them to fuse with the target cell membrane and transfer the cargo into the cytoplasm additionally this special structure protects the contents of the exosomes from degradation 36to investigate the effects of exosomes derived from mscs a study can be performed according to the following steps and characteristicsat the first section of the study mscs should be isolated from tissues different sources can be chosen such as adipose tissue bone marrow wharton jelly and etc second these cells will be cultured then the differentiation potential of homogenous population of spindle-shaped mscs will be determined using in vitro adipogenic and osteogenic induction in addition the immunophenotype of mscs will be confirmed by measurement of cd73 cd90 cd105 cd14 cd45 cd34 and hla-dr cell surface marker using flowcytometry after the adaptation of the cells with serum-free medium the supernatants of them can be collected then a good manufacturing practice gmp-grade method should be used for the isolation of the exosomes from the supernatants as a medicinal product 37 the next step is to characterize the exosomes for this purpose the size distribution of isolated exosomes will be evaluated using dynamic light scattering dls and nanosight nanoparticle tracking analysis nta the morphology of these vesicles will be determined using scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem analysis in addition the expression of exosome membrane specific markers including cd9 cd63 and cd81 will be assessed using western blot or flowcytometrythe second section of the study is related to animal model preparation and exosome injection to them it is better to choose two ards models that induced by different condition and compare them with each other for example a hace2 transgenic animal infected with sars-cov-2 38 and an lps-induced ards animal 24 next the isolated exosomes should be injected into these animals intravenous or intratracheal injection can be performed it is suggested to use both of these routes and compare them with each other injection program can be designed like this pbs exosomes derived from other sources such as fibroblasts msc-exosomes dose 1 msc-exosomes dose 2 and other dosesin the final section of the study the effects of exosome injection on different groups should be measured lung function assessment can be investigated through arterial oxygenation and static lung compliance evaluation 22 in addition to these histological examination or micro-ct can be done for assessment of the lung injury ball is an important sample for evaluating the effects of msc-exorcisms on lung inflammation after collection of the ball sample differential leukocyte count can be done for the monitoring of the viral load real time pcr is a beneficial technique evaluating the cytokine profile using elisa can be useful another sample is blood that differential leukocyte count inflammatory cytokines and crp level are the important data for evaluating msc-exosomes effects on ards and cytokine storm all of these procedure can be performed in clinical trials studies after confirmation in animal models fig 2
since covid-19 treatment is currently focused on supportive therapies and no vaccine has not been developed for it 6 so numerous research studies are needed to find potential therapies to control the virus as soon as possible because sars-cov-2 has high transmission potential and spreads rapidly throughout the world and causes many deaths since the pathogenesis of this disease was identified partially in previous studies and there are similarities between its pathogenesis with that of other viruses in this family and some bacterial infections and can cause lung injury with ards 1 5 14 so investigation of the therapeutic approaches that can suppress inflammation cytokine storm and ards can be helpful in finding a novel therapeutic approach for this disease therefore the use of mscs as one of the immunomodulating and tissue regenerating cells that have previously shown satisfactory effects on ards and cytokine storms 19 21 22 23 24 39 could be considered since these cells exert their effects in a variety of ways such as exosomes secretion the use of their exosomes can be considered as a cell-free therapy 31 because these exosomes can have anti-inflammatory effects on lung tissue by transferring mrnas mirnas and various proteins from its secretory cell to the target cell 40 as previously shown these exosomes can reduce inflammatory cytokines increase regulatory cytokines and suppress inflammation 34 monsel et al also showed that msc-exosomes could increase survival of alveolar type ii cells by increasing intracellular atp levels 41 so we introduced this hypothesis in order to further study in the future and hope to see satisfactory resultsthe authors have no conflict of interestno financial support was used for the development or writing of this manuscriptthe family of coronaviruses cov are enveloped rna viruses which can be highly pathogenic to human beings 1 before long the epidemics of the two highly infectious coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 2 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 3 had resulted disastrous effects to human beings globally the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 originated from wuhan china in the end of 2019 has caused thousands of deaths 4 phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 indicated that it is closely related to sars-cov 79 and a little more distant to mers-cov50 5 the pathological changes of covid-19 dead puncture suggest that its pathological characteristics are very similar to sars-cov and mers-cov-induced viral pneumonia 6 thus it is critical to identify common patterns between these lethal pathogens and immune responsecoronavirus has specific immune response and immune escape characteristics and then causes severe pathogenic mechanisms through inflammation which leaded to severe pneumonia pulmonary oedema ards or multiple organ failure and even death 7 cytokine storm also known as cytokine cascade or hypercytokinemia is caused by infection drugs or autoimmune diseases of the bodys excessive immunity response 8 pioneering investigations have confirmed that increased volumes of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum eg il-1b il-6 il-12 ifn- correlated with pulmonary inflammation and severe lung impairment in sars patients 9 mers-cov infection was also described to provoke increased concentrations of cytokines il-15il-17 tnf- and ifn- 10 it is reported that victims infected with sars-cov-2 also demonstrate high amounts of il-1b ifn- ip10 and mcp1 which may attribute to activated th1 t helper cell responses 11 although these virus invaded human bodies through various proteinssars-cov angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace-2 mers-cov dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ddp-4 sars-cov-2 ace-2 possibly the similar cytokine cascade from immune response which caused severe damage has been widely covered 12hence identifying the key cytokines induced by coronavirus infection and the cells involved in the regulation of cytokine storms blocking their signal transduction will greatly reduce the inflammatory response and damage to the lung tissue and multiple organs of patientssars-cov-2 shows 88 identity to the sequence of sars-like coronaviruses and about 50 to the sequence of mers-cov due to the similar structure their pathogenesis is similar sars-cov-2 just like sars-cov requires the ace-2 mers-cov enters target cells not via ace-2 but via binding to dpp-4 both ace-2 and dpp-4 are expressed in several human tissues while the virus enters the cells antigen presentation subsequently stimulates the bodys humoral and cellular immunity which are mediated by virus-specific immune cells immune response causes a lot of symptoms and the main death cause of coronavirus is cytokine storm which is the deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response covid-19 induced strong immune response is resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which are similar to the symptoms of sars-cov and mers-cov infections hence although the pathogenesis of covid-19 is poorly understood the similar mechanisms of sars-cov and mers-cov still can give us a lot of information on the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 infection to facilitate our recognition of covid-19 figure 1to explore sars-cov induced immune responses infected mice group was analyzed lungs from mice were harvested at 12 24 and 48 hours post-infection and at least 3 biological replicates were collected as pneumonia in the elderly is more susceptible to infection and the symptoms are heavier the changes in inflammatory factors at 12 24 and 48 hours after the infection of the sars virus in elderly rats were analyzed and multiple factors were found to occur il-1 il-1  il-6 and il-10 presented a significant higher level and was more obvious at 24 hours while the level of il-7 showed moderate fluctuation and il-23 a decreased trend figure 2 the results showed that sars-cov infection induced a cytokine stormas for interferon system which protects mammals against virus infections we analyzed the changes of interferon at 12h 24h and 48h after infection with sars virus in elderly rats we found ifn-2 ifn-1 and ifn2 all demonstrated higher expression volumes especially in 24h figure 3 which suggest the onset such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells pdcs and proinflammatory monocytes in terms of changes in chemokines which synergistically induce a proinflammatory recruitment the level of ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 and ccl10 are all drastically elevated in 24h and remained high level in 48h in the meantime cxcl3 expression increased in 24h but decreased in 48h and cxcl5 expression showed a decreased trend in 24h and 48h compared to 12h figure 4 taken together these rising molecules reflected anti-viral response from the host in the early phasein order to explore the common pattern of immune response after coronavirus contagion we analyzed the situation in mers-cov infected human microvascular endothelial cells so we analyzed the expression genes of interleukins and interferons after 24h and we found interleukins il-6 il-23 il-10 il-7 il-1 il-1 and interferons ifn-2 ifn2 ifn- have increased dramatically figure 5 which indicated an elevated anti-virus immune responseto explore the immune differences between young and aged mice we analyzed the cytokine variation after sars-cov infected for 12 and 24 hours the results showed that several cytokines increase more significantly in aged mice than young mice figure 6 it indicated that coronavirus may cause more severe cytokine storms in elderly patients to quantify the immune response on cell level we applied ssgsea method to compare the variation of different immune cells of aged and young mice after sars-cov infection the level of t cells nk cells and monocytes increased significantly both in aged and young mice lymphoid cells show an elevated level in young mice but remained stable comparatively in aged mice and granulocytes tend to decrease both in aged and young mice after the infection interestingly monocytes aged mice increased more quickly 24h than in the young mice 48h figure 7 the results showed that coronavirus infection can cause strong immune response in both young and old mice lymphocyte-mediated immune responses are more severe in young mice but monocyte-mediated immune responses are more rapid in older micefor further study we analyzed immune cells in peripheral blood of 463 patients with covid-19 disease table 1 we found that total lymphocytes cd3 cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes significantly went down in the severe type patients compared to the common type figure 8 which indicated sars-cov-2 can impose hard blows on human lymphocyte resulting in lethal pneumonia moreover total lymphocytes and cd8 t lymphocyte counts decreased more severely in patients  50 years old than those below 50 which suggest that young patients are more likely to bounce back and cd3 or cd4 lymphocyte counts showed no significant difference between different age groupspathological manifestations of covid-19 greatly resemble what has been seen in sars and mers infection which massive interstitial inflammatory infiltrates diffused in the lung 6 the cellular fibromyxoid exudate which caused severe alveolar impairment from postmortem autopsy indicates the cytokine storm may play a critical role in patient rapid death in this study we found that genes coding interleukinsil-1 il-1 il-6 il-10 chemokines ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 ccl10 and interferons ifn-2 ifn-1 and ifn2 raised significantly in sars-cov treated mice within 24h which in line with the elevated infiltration of t cells nk cells and monocytes and similar pattern of cytokine projection were found in the mers-cov infected groupinvestigating the inflammatory profile in sars and mers may advance our knowledge of the immune-pathological process in covid-19 treatment in this study we reviewed sars-infected mice and mers-treated human micro vascular endothelial cells to clarify the association between temporal changes in cytokinechemokine profiles and the six immune cell infiltration patterns we retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 463 cases with common and severe type covid-19 who discharged before february 6 2020 we found that severe type of patients suffered more serious symptoms like higher fever and took more time to recover which may suggest the fluctuation of immune indices is of predictive valueto explore the specific mechanism of immune environment changes we analyzed potential influencing factors cytokines not merely aid in the process of antimicrobial immunity but are liable for immune-pathological damage to owner cells causing significant morbidity or even fatality in multiple respiratory disorders as well 17 18 chemokines like cxcl10 ip10 and ccl2 mcp-1 proved to be up-regulated in monocytesmacrophages by sars-cov which is consistent with our results 19 the clinical progression of mers cases proves that secretion of monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 mcp-1 cxcl10 is out of control 20 pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6 ccl5 and interferon-stimulated genes cxcl10 are involved in toll-like receptors tlr signaling 21 these molecules are effectors on the process of respiratory virus infections towards the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which is lethal to the covid-19 patients 22 il-12 is the main cytokine secreted by dcs that manages the differentiation of cd4 t cells into th1 cells and serves essential duty in cell-mediated immunity and il-23 which includes in the il-12 family are predominantly pro-inflammatory cytokines which contribute critical roles in the growth of th17 cells 23 24 increased expression of il-12 and il-23 after sars-infected lung tissue in mice may indicate the activated response of th1 and th17 cells which is observed in mers victims as well 10 interesting in the sars-cov infected cells the ace-2 was significantly correlated with neutrophils nk cells th17 cells th2 cells th1 cells dc which may call for further investigations 25ifn- is regarded as one of the bodys primary antiviral defenses ifn- exerts its effects through intercellular communication resulting the induction of ifn- and interferon-stimulated genes isgs which make up an important aspect of host antiviral defense 26 notwithstanding particular cell types such as pdcs and monocytes have been confirmed to produce more ifn than other cell types when viral infection committed 27 and elevated level of ifn and monocyte infiltration in our analysis validates this the innate immune response on the basis of pdcs and monocytes may play substantial role in the formation of the cytokine storm which damages the lung severelylymphopenia is common in covid-19 patients severe lymphocyte reduction occurred in about 10 of patients especially in the heavy group which is consistent with the latest reported results 28 flow cytometry showed that cd3 cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes had decreased to varying degrees and aged patients suffered a more severe decrease in total lymphocytes and cd8 t lymphocytes about 40 of patients had a decrease in cd4  t lymphocytes and the incidence was higher in the heavy group than in the common group this shows that sars-cov-2 may mainly attack lymphocytes in the body which can cause the reduction of cd4  t lymphocytes resulting in decreased immune function and infection and severe cases of severe pneumoniain a word we analyze the cytokine profiles in sars-cov infected mice and mers-cov infected human micro vascular cells interleukin il-1

of developed vaccines and targetted antiviral drugs
1
 consequently it is important to utilize any substance that can more widely limit viral effects often as in the case of covid19 there is little likelihood of developing a vaccine or antiviral within a year of the emergence of such a devastating infection utilizing or developing more generic antivirals is a significant challenge given that viruses can vary considerably as to the their effects including on the immune system for example a general antiviral requirement for influenza and covid19 would be for a treatment that limits the initial innate immuneassociated cytokine storm where evident while also acting to increase the efficacy of the adaptive immune response
2
 however for the ebola virus such initial dampening of the innate immune response is not so clinically relevant allowing for such variability in virus effects melatonin has emerged as a top candidate for protection against an array of different viruses including the coronavirus3 4 5 this would seem to arise from the close evolution of melatonin within the emerging mitochondria in the first singlecellular organsims allowing melatonin to be intimately associated with mitochondrial function and thereby with immune system regulation
6
 the interactions of our bacterialdriven coexistence with viruses have provided a war of the worlds from which plant and animal evolution have emerged and in which evolution has acted to tolerate and limit rather than annihilate melatonin is an important aspect of our interactions with virusesas data pertaining to the pathophysiology of covid19 have still to emerge the current article focusses primarily on the role of melatonergic pathway in the management of influenza viruses as well as highlighting its potential utility in supporting people at high risk of fatality from influenza viruses and covid19 at the time of writing data from china and italy indicate that the elderly are at far higher risk of covid19 linked mortality primarily as a consequence of ageingassociated conditions such as cardiovascular pulmonary and diabetic disorders as well as in immunecompromised conditions melatonin has clinical utility in all of these health conditions suggesting its utility in buffering against covid19 interactions with these medical conditions however the interactions of the melatonergic pathway with viruses may be more complex than ameliorative effects on ageingassociated preexisting medical conditions first the melatonergic pathway is reviewed and how this pathway may interact with the effects of the influenza covid19 and other viruses this has treatment implications as well as providing indications as to important future research on how an understanding of human physiological systems can provide treatment targets that regulate the impact of viral infections including influenza and covid19 driven pathophysiologythe circadian entrainment induced by pineal melatonin is strongly driven by melatonins upregulation of the circadian gene bmal1 which seems to mediate many of melatonins effects in mitochondria bmal1 inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase pdk leading to the disinhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pdc pdc drives the conversion of pyruvate to acetylcoenzyme a acetylcoa in mitochondria thereby increasing the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation oxphos and atp production acetylcoa is also a necessary cosubstrate for aanat and therefore allows pineal melatonin via the bmal1pdkpdc path to increase the activation of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway for this to happen aanat needs to be stabilized by 1433 protein which is present within the mitochondrial matrix16 17 it has been proposed that aanat may also be stabilized by the mitochondrial ionic channel letm1 which has a 1433like motif in its cterminal within the mitochondrial matrix
18

the pineal melatoninmitochondrial melatonin path may be most important in immune cells although relevant in all cells subject to circadian regulation by pineal melatonin the daytime activation of immune cells is associated with glycolytic metabolism which pineal melatonin resets to oxphos thereby inducing more quiescent immune cell phenotyes it is by such processes that immune cells are dampened at night however in the presence of indicants of required immuneinflammatory activity at night proinflammatory cytokines can switch off pineal melatonin production thereby forming another branch of the immunepineal axis
19
 as such the circadian rhythm as driven by pineal melatonin is a powerful immune regulator with effects that can include the upregulation of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway a decrease in pineal melatonin as often occurs in the elderly and in conditions associated with high susceptibility to severe viral infection can therefore have a significant impact on the mitochondrial metabolism and phenotype of immune cells as well as of other cell types including cns glial cells the suppression of pineal melatonin is proposed to increase the susceptibility to an array of medical conditions including cancers16 17 via the loss of this nighttime shift from glycolytic metabolism to oxphos such interactions of pineal melatonin with mitochondrial metabolism and the melatonergic pathway provide important points of impact by viral infectionsviruses can have quite distinct interactions with the host over the course of an infection making generalizations across different viruses impossible however some factors have been found to regulate the effects of many different viruses one such factor is the ahrthe ahr has a number of endogenous and exogenous ligands including 2378tetrachlorodibenzopdioxin tcdd commonly found in cigarette smoke polychlorinated biphenyl congener 126 pcb126 a common pollutant the novel pharmaceutical 21hindole3carbonylthiazole4carboxylic acid methyl ester ite and the endogenous ahr ligand 6formylindolo32bcarbazole ficz which is a tryptophan degradation product all of these ligands can modulate immune responses to viral infection20 21 however it is the activation of the ahr by kynurenine and kynurenic acid that more readily links the ahr to immune inflammatory activity as shown in figure 1 ahr activation by different ligands can result in some differential effects complicating the understanding of ahr activation the ahr is also differentially expressed over the circadian rhythm thereby linking the ahr to variations in the immune response over the circadian rhythm
22
 as noted ahr activation induces an increase in mitochondrial cyp1b1 thereby contributing to an elevated nasmelatonin ratio given proinflammatory cytokine induction of ahr ligands ahr activation is therefore an aspect of the cytokine storm that can follow viral infection thereby contributing to suppressed serotonin and melatonin availability whilst also having consequences for the regulation of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway including the nasmelatonin ratioa number of studies show the ahr modulates the antiviral immune response including the prototypical coronavirus murine hepatitis virus
23
 these authors show that the ahr is an important mediator of how this coronavirus modulates the hosts immune response leading to the expression of several effector genes including tcddinducible polyadpribose polymerase tiparp which is required for maximal coronavirus replication this study also showed that the ahr modulates macrophage and dendritic cell responses including the levels of interleukin il1 il10 and tumor necrosis factor tnf
23
 other data show the different ahr ligands differentially modulate immunoglobulin igg and cd8 tcell responses to the influenza virus with the loss of cyp1 attenuating ahrdriven effects on virusdriven immune responses
20
 whether such ahrdriven effects are regulated by variations in the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway and nasmelatonin ratio requires investigation including as to the relevance of these ahrassociated pathways in covid19 infection overall the ahr may be an important link between the initial cytokine storm and alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell function including via alterations in the melatonergic pathwaythe influence of the circadian rhythm is also seen following influenza vaccination where the timing of vaccination and of sample collection modulates the bcell response measures especially in the elderly
24
 the host circadian rhythm is a significant regulator of the response to viral infection preclinical data show that irrespective of the viral burden survival following influenza viral infection is determined by the circadian influence on the patterning of the immune response
25
 the circadian gene bmal1 is a significant inhibitor of herpes simplex virus hsv1 and influenza viruses highlighting the role of circadian factors in the regulation of viral infections
26
 as the loss of the circadian rhythm can increase viral replication viruses can act to sabotage circadian regulation exemplified by hsv1 suppression of bmal1
26
 this overlaps to data in the lung where pulmonary airway epithelial cell bmal1 regulates the response to the influenza virus
27
 with the influenza virus also decreasing bmal1 thereby contributing to the circadian disruption induced by this virus
28
 such data highlight the circadian nature of host physiology including in many virusrelevant pathways upon which viruses act to promote their survival and proliferationas noted the effects of pineal melatonin include bmal1 induction which is a major driver of pineal melatonins influence on circadian rhythms with bmal1 acting to regulate mitochondrial metabolism the effects of melatonininduced bmal1 include the suppression of pdk and the disinhibition of pdc thereby increasing the conversion of pyruvate to acetylcoa for the tca cycle oxphos and atp production concurrently acetylcoa acts to upregulate the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway with consequences that include the stimulation of sirtuin3 and superoxide dismutase 2 sod2 the circadian impacts on mitochondrial metabolism have been most thoroughly investigated in immune cells however this would seem relevant to the regulation of metabolism in all cells as such the effects of viral infection on the circadian rhythm are intimately linked to alterations in mitochondrial metabolism and the nature of the immune response within this framework the viral suppression of pineal melatonin will be intimately associated with concurrent alterations in the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway and thereby with key aspects of mitochondrial metabolism consequently some viruses act to inhibit both pineal and mitochondrial melatonin productionthe importance of such processes is given some support by data in humans with a severe influenza infection and associated poor survival rates severe influenza and covid19 infections seem driven by an initial cytokine storm with the increase in proinflammatory cytokines acting to suppress pineal melatonin production
29
 this is the essence of the immunepineal axis
19
 whereby proinflammatory cytokines act to signal the need for an ongoing immune response and thereby prevent its suppression by pineal melatonin the major driver of the multiorgan failure that is evident in severe influenza infection is the dysregulation of mitochondrial metabolism
30
 and the lost influence of decreased pineal melatonin on such metabolic dysregulation an elevation in cellular trypsin as a hemagglutinin processing protease for viral multiplication is often an aspect of this leading to the influenza viruscytokinetrypsin cycle which is coupled to a decrease in mitochondrial atp
30

work on the influenza viruscytokinetrypsin cycle has led to new proposed treatments which target the atp crisis and multiorgan failure that occur during the late phase of infection this contrasts to the utilization of antiviral treatments with neuraminidase inhibitors which are targeted to processes that are evident in the initial phase of influenza infection treatment options proposed include the restoration of mitochondrial oxphos thereby countering infectioninduced pdk4 activation and therefore pdc inhibition clearly the reestablishment of the effector of the circadian rhythm by melatonin treatment would more naturally target an upregulation of bmal1 and mitochondrial oxphos as to how viruses that suppress bmal1 interact with exogenous melatonin will be important to determine including as to the most effective melatonin dose if applicableas il1 seems an important proinflammatory cytokine in the upregulation of the influenza viruscytokinetrypsin cycle this would indicate a role for the induction of the nod lrr and pyrin domaincontaining protein nlrp3 inflammasome
31
 most viruses increase their proliferation and survival via an increase in the nlrp3 inflammasome
32
 with the regulation of the nlrp3 inflammasome being taken over by viruses
33
 as melatonin is a significant inhibitor of the nlrp3 inflammasome
34
 the suppression of melatonin production both pineal and mitochondrial by viruses is likely to be an important aspect of how viruses disengage the nlrp3 inflammasome from physiological processes it should also be noted that il18 is induced along with il1 from nlrp3 inflammasome activation with il18 being relatively underinvestigated in viral research as in many other medical conditions
35
 il18 and il1 pathway interactions may also be relevant to the interactions of preexisting bacterial infection with new covid19 or influenza infection in the regulation of disease severity and patient survival
36
 overall the viral inhibition of melatonin may contribute to increased nlrp3 inflammasome and thereby to viral proliferation and survivalsirtuins are an important aspect of mitochondrial metabolism both directly via mitochondrialocated sirtuins sirtuin3 4 5 and indirectly via cytosolic sirtuin1 induction of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma pparppar coactivator1 pgc1  which is a major regulatory path of mitochondrial metabolism the sirtuins are also an aspect of the circadian rhythm
37
 alterations in the levels and effects of cytosolic nuclear and mitochondrial sirtuins are also evident in a number of viral infections including within dendritic cells which have an important role in regulating the patterned immune response
38
 generally the sirtuins seem to be evolutionary conserved antiviral agents
39
 like the circadian rhythm viruses may act to disengage sirtuins from their regular physiological processes the evolutionary conserved relationship of melatonininduced sirtuins is important to the maintenance of mitochondrial function
40
 highlighting another important aspect of normal mitochondrial function that viruses can disengage via the suppression of pineal and mitochondrial melatoninmicrornas mirna are important mediators of cellular coordination with each mirna regulating up to 100 genes consequently alterations in the regulation of mirnas are another aspect of how viruses modulate immune and wider cell function a number of mirnas act to suppress ywhaz1433 including mir7 mir375 and mir451 thereby suppressing the 1433 stabilization of aanat and leading to a general inhibition of the melatonergic pathway increased mir451 is one of the mechanisms whereby the influenza virus acts to regulate dendritic cells and therefore patterned immune activity
41
 the influenza virus also increases mir7
42
 whilst mir375 can have contrasting effects of viral survival and replication
43
 although mirnas can influence multiple genes the impact of quite distinct viruses on these mitochondrial melatonergic pathway regulating mirnas would indicate an important role for this pathway in to how viruses can determine cellular functionthere is a growing interest in the role of the gut microbiome across a host of diverse medical conditions including neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions
44
 but also immunemediated conditions such as multiple sclerosis and arthritis15 45 in line with this recent data show that many viral infections including influenza drive changes in the gut and lung microbiomes
46
 with viralmediated changes in the gut including gut dysbiosis and increased gut permeability these authors also show how such changes in the gut microbiomepermeability can contribute to secondary bacterial pneumonia
46
 the high levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines that are evident in many viral infections especially during the cytokine storm increase gut permeability both directly and via mucosal mast cells mucosal mast cell tnf as increased by stressinduced corticotropin releasing hormone crh
47
 also mediates psychological stressinduced gut dysbiosispermeability these are two mechanisms whereby infection induced increases in gut dysbiosispermeability can occur with consequences for mitochondria and immune cell function as well as for the severity of viral infectionsthere are a number of ways that the gut microbiomepermeability can be relevant to viral infection pathophysiology including from a reduction in the gut microbiomederived shortchain fatty acid butyrate to an increase in the levels of circulating lipopolysaccharide lps arising from an increase in gut permeability
48
 as the alterations in butyrate and lps can impact mitochondrial function and immune system responses including from changes in the regulation of immune cell mitochondria such changes in gut processes provide another focus for viral interactions with wider body systemsgut dysbiosis and increased gut permeability are intimately linked butyrate acts to maintain the gut barrier at least in part via an increase in the melatonergic pathway in intestinal epithelial cells
49
 butyrate is also an immunesuppressant via its capacity to disinhibit pdc and thereby increase mitochondrial oxphos tca cycle and acetylcoa for the melatonergic pathway
17
 it seems not unlikey that butyrate therefore acts on the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway to increase melatonin production as suggested by its induction of the melatonergic pathway in intestinal epithelial cells
49
 dysregulating the gut microbiome and decreasing gutderived butyrate may therefore be another mechanism whereby viruses can act to modulate mitochondrial and immune cell function butyrate is also a histone deacetylase hdac inhibitor thereby allowing it have epigenetic regulatory effects that are relevant to viral infections a number of hdacs act to regulate viral infections with the inhibition of hdac1 leading to a decrease in influenzadriven pneumonia infections
50
 the role of gut microbiomederived butyrate and the nutriceutical sodium butyrate in the regulation of viral infections clearly requires further investigationthe increase in gut permeability driven by proinflammatory cytokines allows for an elevation in the levels of circulating lps from the early phases of some viral infections by activating tolllike receptor tlr24 circulating lps can modulate the immune system as well as many other cells as most viruses first make contact with their hosts mucosal surfaces which are typically already colonized with bacterial microbials bacteriavirus interactions are a longestablished integral aspect of viral infections
51
 tlr4 activation by lps potentiates the lethality of influenza virus infection in preclinical models by increasing proinflammatory cytokine production and the glycolytic metabolic reprogramming of dendritic cells which the authors propose to be partly mediated by the induction of the tlr4 ligand highmobility group box hmgb1
52
 this is supported by other preclinical data
53

under conditions of increased gut permeability intestinal epithelial cells increase hmgb1 release in exosomes
54
 suggesting that both circulating lps and exosomal hmgb1 may contribute to viral lethality via increased gut permeability the roles of lps and hmgb1 require further investigation as to their influence on the course of different viral infections
55
 as clearly the levels of circulating lps are far lower than in most preclinical experimental investigations it also requires investigation as to whether a preexisting increase in gut permeability as in many preestablished medical conditions or following psychological stress interact with the pathophysiological changes induced by different viral infections this has treatment implications including the use of sodium butyrate which maintains the gut barrier and attenuates the stressinduced increase in proinflammatory cytokines from mucosal mast cells that underpin psychological stressinduced gut permeability
56

the increase in proinflammatory cytokines and the cytokine storm that can contribute to viral infection severity and fatality are positively regulated by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system as shown with influenza virus infection
57
 these authors also showed sympathetic nervous system activation to increase pulmonary pneumonia in a preclinical model with the inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system increasing survival
57
 some of the effects of the sympathetic nervous system may be mediated by an increase release of not only catecholamines but also neuropeptide y npy the release of which from monocytes also contributes to influenzaassociated fatality
58

in contrast the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system following the vagal nerve release of acetylcholine affords protection against some viral infections via the activation of the alpha 7 acetylcholine nicotinic receptor 7nachr
59
 including decreasing macrophage inflammatory responses
60
 it should be noted that the 7nachr is intimately associated with melatonin being positively regulated by pineal melatonin over the circadian rhythm
61
 whilst the impact of melatonin in preventing gut permeability under challenge is mediated by its induction of vagal nerve ach release and subsequent 7nachr activation
62
 as such the viral suppression of melatonin will be associated with a decrease in its induction of the 7nachr and vagal ach thereby decreasing the viral and immunesuppressive activity of vagal activated 7nachrs it should also be noted that the 7nachr is expressed on the mitochondria outer membrane suggesting more direct impacts on mitochondrial function including in immune cells and in the regulation of mitochondria ca2 influx63 64
overall shifts in the balance of the sympatheticparasympathetic nervous systems may be another aspect of viral infections this is another route whereby the viral regulation of the melatonergic pathway can act on wider systemic regulatory processes in a manner to increase viral severity and decrease host survivalit is also noteworthy that increased gut dysbiosispermeability is frequently associated with the preexisting health conditions that increase the risk of fatality from viral infections preexisting health conditions that increase fatality risk from influenza and covid19 include cardiovascular and lung disorders diabetes and cancer
65
 many of the specific medical conditions that are included within these groups of disorders are linked to an elevation in gut dysbiosispermeability66 67 mitochondrial dysfunction
68
 and circadian dysregulation69 70 with melatonin showing utility in their management71 72 ageing the main risk factor for death from influenza and covid19 is highly associated with these pathophysiological changes73 74 75 76 with melatonin partly via sirtuin induction as well as circadian and mitochondria regulation attenuating ageingassociated processes
77
 overall such data would suggest that the pathophysiological changes associated with many viruses overlap with the biological underpinnings of the highrisk conditions associated with increased risk of virusassociated fatalitydoes melatonin have utility in decreasing symptoms and fatality rates of influenza and covid19 viruses if so what are the relevant doses extrapolating from preclinical data would suggest that doses as high as 500 mg may be necessary to dampen the initial cytokine storm such doses are well tolerated in humans but clearly require investigation in virusinfected patientsdoes melatonin attenuate the downregulation of bmal1 by the influenza and possibly covid19 virusesdoes pinealderived melatonin and exogenous melatonin increase the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway in immune cells and other cell types including during the course of viral infectionpreclinical data shows that maternal exposure to an ahr ligand can drive alterations in the immune response to viral infection in the offspring
78
 it requires investigation as to whether such transgenerational effects on the viral immune response involve alterations in the mitochondrial melatonergic pathwayis the regulation of the nasmelatonin ratio by the ahrcyp1b1 cyp2c19 mglur5 p2y1 receptor or odemethylation relevant to the pathophysiology of different virusesdoes covid19 decrease the bmal1pdcacetylcoatca cycleoxphos path with consequences that include suppression of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway and associated changes in sirtuins and mitochondrial antioxdant enzymeshow important is the induction of gut dysbiosispermeability to the consequences of the cytokine storm at the early stages of severe viral infectionsil18 was formally known as ifninducing factor with ifn having a significant role in the regulation of immune responses to viral infection
79
 does nlrp3 inflammasome induction of il18 have a distinct role from nlrp3induced il1 in virusdriven pathophysiology via their differential regulation of ifnwhat is the relevance of elevations in circulating lps arising from increased gut permeability to proliferation and severity of viral infections including influenza and covid19to what extent do variations in the melatonergic pathway and gut dysbiosispermeability explain the large variance in influenza and covid19 symptom severity across the general populationhow relevant are variations in the autonomic nervous system and 7nachr activation to symptom severity in influenza and covid19 viral infectionsgiven the common viral suppression of melatonin coupled to melatonins positive modulation of processes inhibited by most viruses it is not unreasonable to propose melatonin to have utility in limiting the symptomatology and fatality associated with viral infection including influenza and covid19 melatonin may also have prophylactic utility especially in people with preexistent medical conditions associated with suppressed pineal melatonin synthesisgiven the role of gut microbiomederived butyrate and its nutriceutical equivalent sodium butyrate in the regulation of mitochondrial function the melatonergic pathway and hdac inhibition does butyrate have a role in pathophysiology and treatment of viral infectionsare there any additive or synergistic interactions of melatonin and butyrate treatments in the management of viral infections including in decreasing fatalities from influenza and covid19 infectionsoverall commonly affected processes in viral infections would suggest that the lack of an available vaccine and antiviral and their impotence in the face of new viral mutations should not necessarily lead to a management response that is solely dependent upon social isolation in order to decrease human mortality a number of factors can act to inhibit the key cellular changes upon which viruses act with melatonin being one such factor the utility of melatonin is paradoxically underappreciated if not suppressed by its ready availability low cost and very high safety profile at the time of writing there has been a significant impact of covid19 on global economies it would seem inappropriate to wait for the pharmaceutical companies to provide a targeted antiviral and vaccine in over a years time at which point covid19 may well have mutated as highlighted throughout viral impacts on human physiology allows for the use of nutriceuticals and pharmaceuticals that may lower infection severity by targeting physiological processes melatonin is one such substance melatonin is actively inhibited by most viruses indicating its importance in the regulation of viral infections a further benefit of melatonin in the management of influenza and covid19 arises from its utility in management of the array of preexisting medical conditions associated with virallinked fatality the potential benefits of sodium butyrate in the management of influenza and covid19 infections include its immune suppressive and mitochondrial optimization effects as well as its induction of the melatonergic pathway and ability to decrease the gut permeability that is associated with high risk preexisting medical conditions overall there are biomedical financial and moral reasons for developing and testing interventions that may immediately limit the impact of viral infectionsnot applicablethe authors declare no potential conflict of interestcoronavirus disease of 2019 covid-19 caused by infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread across the world as a serious pandemic 1 2 sars-cov-2 an enveloped virus with non-segmented single-stranded positive-sense rna genome 3 is a member of the coronaviridae cov family which causes a predominantly respiratory illness with a wide range of clinical severity ranging from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic fever cough dyspnea myalgias fatigue and diarrhea in a large proportion of patients to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and fatal multi-organ failure 1 46 7 the disease has a case-fatality rate that ranges from less than 05 to more than 7 average  38 8 with an infectivity greater than that of influenza 9 its high transmissibility and relatively high rate of causing serious complications has led covid-19 to become a serious public health threat worldwideamong various physiological consequences of severe covid-19 cardiovascular complications have emerged as some of the most significant and life threatening covid-19 may present with respiratory failure from pneumonia and ards with or without distributive  cardiogenic shock 10 11 12 and severe cardiac injury manifesting as markedly elevated troponin and heart failure 12 1314 cardiac injury has also been associated with increased mortality 15 in a cohort study of 416 patients with confirmed covid-19 elevated troponin was present in 197 of patients during hospitalization and was found to be an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality 15 the increased incidence of cardiac injury among those with severe systemic inflammatory response syndromes sirs and shock in the setting of covid-19 also highlights an important relationship between the immune response to the virus and the cardiovascular system in addition a high prevalence of pre-existing cardio-metabolic disease has been noted among those with severe covid-19 16 17 and those with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions suffer increased mortality during covid-19 infection 18 in particular the reported case fatality rates for covid-19 are 105 in patients with cardiovascular disease 73 in patients with diabetes and 60 in those with hypertension higher than the case-fatality rate of 34 observed world-wide for patients without these co-morbidities 7 last but not least the increased frequency of adverse cardiovascular events following the resolution of covid-19 similar to other viral infections such as influenza 19 may also play a role in worsening the mortality of patients with covid-19 thus understanding the relationship between the viral-host immune response and the cardiovascular system will be critically important in our care and management of patients with covid-19 going forwardin order to better understand the biology of viral immune response and how it impacts the heart we explore here the basic biological mechanisms underlying viral entry into the host cells and the subsequent immune response coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a single-strand positive-sense rna genome approximately 2632 kilobases in size which is the largest known genome for an rna virus six coronaviruses covs are known to infect humans 229e oc43 sars-cov nl63 hku1 and mers-cov 3 in humans cov infections primarily involve the upper respiratory tract and gi tract 3 studies have demonstrated that sars-cov-2 as well as other corona viruses requires the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 for cellular entry 20 ace2 is a type i integral membrane protein that serves an important role in cardiorenal homeostasis it is also highly expressed in lung alveolar cells providing the main entry site for virus into human hosts 21 it is plausible that the high expression of ace2 in the lung gut heart and kidneys may facilitate direct damage by the virus throughout the course of infection one key protein on the virusthe spike protein sfacilitates viral entry into the target cells by the binding of its surface unit s1 to the ace2 receptor on the host cell 2123 followed by cleavage by host-cell protease tmprss2 24 other important sars-cov-2 components include the hemagglutinin-esterase protein the membrane m protein the nucleocapsid protein the small envelope protein the internal protein and group-specific proteins which could become targets for vaccines in the future 25 of note sars-cov-2 also contains an rna-dependent rna polymerase which is the target of the anti-viral agent remdesivir currently being studied randomized clinical trials for use against covid-19 disease 26the host immune response to viral entry is also important to discuss as pathogenesis in the later stages of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection results not only from direct viral toxicity but also from immune dysregulation and hyperactivity 27 28 progress in this field however has been hindered by the failure to replicate in mice ferrats or non-human primates the lethal human immune response in ards with the original sars-cov strain 29 30 this has led to the development of mouse- or rat-adapted strains of sars-cov that have been able to replicate the extensive and often lethal pulmonary disease 31 the majority of studies addressing the immune response to respiratory viral infections involve mice infected with a variety of natural and mouse-adapted pathogensthe process of respiratory viral invasion into the body begins with infection of the airway epithelial cells and the activation of lung-resident dentritic cells rdcs via acquisition of the invading pathogen or antigens from infected epithelial cells these rdcs then become activated process antigen and migrate to the draining mediastinal and cervical lymph nodes dln nave circulating t cells in the dlns then recognize antigens presented on the dcs in the form of mhcpeptide complexes in combination with additional co-stimatory signals t cells then become activated proliferate and migrate to the infected site 32 33 upon arrival to the site of infection t cells produce and release antiviral cytokines including interferon ifn- tumor necrosis factor tnf- and interleukin il-2 chemokines including cxc chemokine ligand cxcl-9 10 and 11 and cytotoxic molecules such as perforin and granzyme b 34 ifn- and other effector cytokines directly inhibit viral replication and enhance antigen presentation while the chemokines released by activated t cells recruit more innate and adaptive cells to combat the pathogen granzyme b and other cytotoxic molecules also directly kill infected cells to eliminate the pathogen 3538recent data from china on sars-cov-2 28 39 as well as prior data from sars-cov 40 demonstrate a rapid reduction of t lymphocytes both cd4 and cd8 in the peripheral blood of infected patients 27 41 42 this is in direct contrast to the proliferative lymphocyte responses seen with other viral infections such as epstein-barr virus ebv human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 or cytomegalovirus cmv but similar to what happens during other acute viral infections such as influenza the loss of lymphocytes precedes even the abnormal radiographic changes on chest x-ray 43 despite reduction in t lymphocyte counts peripheral blood analysis on a patient infected with sars-cov-2 demonstrated increased markers of t lymphocyte activation 44 as evidenced by high proportions of hla-dr and cd38 double-positive fractions 28 additionally there was an increased percentage of highly proinflammatory ccr6 th17 among cd4 t cells and an increased concentration of cytotoxic granules in cd8 t cells 316 perforin positive 642 granulysin positive and 305 granulysinperforin double-positive 28 interestingly one group found that production of ifn- by cd4 t cells but not cd8 t cells or nk cells tended to be lower in severe cases compared with moderate cases 41 cd4 t cells in particular are felt to be especially important in the host-immune defense against sars-cov infections 45 in addition disturbances in t regulatory cells tregs were noted in severe caseswith a significantly lower proportion of c45ra nave tregs ntregs and a slightly higher proportion of their memory counterparts cd45ro memory tregs mtregs 41 on recovery there is a rapid and significant restoration of cd3 cd4 and cd8 t cells along with b cell and nk cell counts 23 months after onset of disease 40 memory cd4 t cells returned to normal 1 year after onset whereas other cell counts including total t lymphocytes cd3 cd4 and nave cd4 t cells were still lower than healthy controls 43 the mechanism of lymphocytopenia in peripheral blood is unclear but thought to be due to sequestration with release of sequestered cells upon recovery 21 taken together these changes in lymphocyte populations suggest dramatic dysregulation evidence of t cell exhaustion and shifts in the adaptive immune response to sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infections 42in addition to changes in lymphocyte populations changes in innate immunity likely also contribute to viral pathogenesis particularly as seen in severe lung and systemic inflammation secondary to cytokine storm in ards increased levels of cytokines such as tnf- ifn inducible protein 10 ip10 il-6 and il-8 are thought to contribute to tissue destruction and poor outcomes 46 attributed to hyperactivation of macrophagemonocyte lineage cells sars-cov-2-infected patients have high levels of il-1 beta ifn- ip-10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 which probably leads to activated t-helper-1 cell response 1 compared with patients who did not require icu admission those requiring icu admission had higher conentrations of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors gcsf ip-10 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein-1  mip-1- and tnf- suggesting that cytokine storm might affect disease severity 47 additionally increased levels of type i ifn and a dysregulated ifn-stimulated gene isg response have been seen in patients with severe sars 48 49last but not least sars-specific igg antibodies are produced in the late acute stage about 2 weeks from symptom onset gradually increase throughout the course of the disease and are felt to be associated with disease outcome 50 the development of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies is highly relevant for both protecting against viral replicationexpansion in the infected host as well as providing a source of anti-sars-cov-2 convalescent plasma to treat patients with severe disease although supporting data for efficacy is currently lacking this is being tested in covid-19 positive patients under an expanded access program by the fda 51myocardial injury manifesting as elevated serum troponin levels has been described in many patients infected with covid-19 and mortality has been associated with increase in troponin levels  99th percentile of the upper limit of normal and with electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities 12 18 52 in addition reports of the rarer manifestation of fulminant myocarditis with markedly elevated troponin levels have been reported 12 13 14there are several thoughts on the mechanism of injury including direct myocardial injury by the virus through ace2 entry hypoxia-induced myocardial injury microvascular damage and endothelial shedding and cytokineinflammation-mediated damage 15 direct viral toxicity on cardiomyocytes has occurred in the setting of other viral infections such as coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis in this case the entry of the coxsackievirus is through the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor car and through release of protease 2a coded by coxsackievirus particles disrupting the dystrophin cytoskeleton complex 5355 in the case of coronavirus as mentioned above the spike s protein of coronaviruses facilitates viral entry into target cells entry depends on binding of the surface unit s1 of the s protein to ace2 allowing the virus to attach to the surface of the target cell in addition entry requires s protein priming by cellular proteases which entails s protein cleavage at the s1s2 and s2 site and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes a process driven by the s2 subunit 23 it was found that sars-2-s shares 76 amino acid identity with sars-s and both engage ace2 and employ the cellular serine protease tmprss2 for s protein priming for host cell entry 22 interestingly injection of sars-cov spike protein into mice worsened acute lung failure in vivo and was attenuated by blockade of the renin-angiotensin pathway 21 also of note tmprss2 is highly expressed in the lung and kidneys but is present in only low to moderate levels in the heart and blood vessels suggesting other mechanisms of injury for the latter organ systems 56 lastly the amount of viral load in sars-cov-2 infection correlates with disease severity with higher viral loads on presentation correlating with worse disease outcomes 57 this study highlights the potential importance of direct viral toxicity in the pathogenesis of covid-19 infectionsin addition to direct damage caused by the virus there has also been speculation of an ischemic effect either in the form of demand ischemia from lung pathology or direct toxicity by the virus on the macro- or microvascular level it has been suggested that because ace2 is expressed on the endothelium it may induce endothelial shedding and dysfunction contributing to vascular damage local inflammation and production of procoagulant factors predisposing to thrombosis similar to the increase in myocardial infarctions observed after influenza infections 19 58 in addition to endothelial inflammation and dysfunction an increased incidence of abnormal coagulation parameters and of disseminated intravascular coagulation dic has been noted in patients with sars-cov-2 infection 59 60 contributing to risk of thrombosis and ischemic events that could damage the myocardiumearly reports of fulminant myocarditis have alerted the medical and scientific communities that myocardial inflammation may play a role in cardiac injury during viral infection 12 13 14 however the exact mechanism of this is currently unclear 12 13 as acute lymphocyte infiltrates were not noted in the myocardium of a sars-cov-2-infected ards patient autopsy 39 where only a few mononuclear inflammatory cells were seen currently there is great interest in obtaining the pathological specimens from patients presenting with markedly elevated troponin and fulminant myocarditis in order to evaluate for lymphocyte-induced myocardial injury in sars-cov-2 infection consistent with this no myocardial-specific epitopes have thus far been identified in the setting of sars-cov or sars-cov-2 infection several hla-a0201-specific t cells recognizing sars-cov epitopes have been identified in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc of sars-recovered individuals including immunogenic epitopes localized to spike s and nucleocapsid n protein of sars-cov 61 62 of note mri-verified acute myocarditis has been reported in association with mers-cov 63 although the exact mechanism by which it occurs is unknownalthough no evidence of direct lymphocytic infiltration of the myocardium exists the dysregulation of t cells can likely contribute to the cytokine storm and multi-organ damage in the setting of coronavirus infection a recent retrospective multi-center study of 150 patients confirmed that inflammatory markers including elevated ferritin mean 12976 ngml in non-survivors vs 6140 ngml in survivors p  0001 and il-6 p  00001 were associated with more severe covid-19 infection suggesting that systemic inflammation may be a significant driver of multi-organ damage 18 64 a separate group has also reported that the serum cytokines il-2r il-6 il-10 and tnf- are increased in patients with severe disease 41 this systemic release of cytokines characterized by increased il-2 il-6 il-10 gcsf ifn- mcp-1 mip-1- and tnf- likely contributes to cardiac injury in a situation analogous to cardiotoxicity in the setting of chimeric antigen receptor car-t cell therapy a prior study demonstrated that cardiac injury and cardiovascular events in the form of elevated troponin and left ventricular systolic dysfunction are common post-car-t in a cohort of 137 patients with post-car-t cytokine release syndrome crs 21 had elevated troponin and 12 developed cardiovascular events including cardiac arrest decompensated heart failure and arrhythmias 65 notably in this study a shorter time from crs onset to the administration of the il-6 inhibitor tocilizumab was associated with a lower rate of cardiovascular events 65 of note tociluzumab may have some benefit in covid-19 infection suggesting a common mechanism of injury in the two settings 66 the exact mechanism by which cytokineschemokines damage the myocardium is unknown but cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell death in the presence of inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- has been well documented in the literature 67 68 age and gender differences in covid-19 infection rates have raised interest in possible differences in age- and gender-dependent immune responses to viral exposure children account for the minority of laboratory-confirmed cases of covid-19 in china and appear less susceptible to severe disease 69 although the functions of both innate and adaptive immune immunity declines with aging this does not typically start until late adulthood and thus would not fully explain the decreased severity of disease in children compared with even young adults 7072 the effect of age on the immune system can be demonstrated by the low protective titers among 50 of adults older than 65 who receive the influenza vaccine 73 additional information about the differential response of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 with aging comes from animal models in comparison with sars-cov-ma15-infected young c57bl6 mice infection of aged mice 12 months is associated with severe reduction in the number of virus-specific cd8 t cells in the lungs 66in addition to the effect of aging gender is also thought to play a role in outcomes in sars-cov-2 infection one study demonstrated a higher incidence of sars-cov-2 infection in older adult males compared with females 74 sex differences in immune response have been noted in literature although the reasons are not clear males experience greater severity and prevalence of bacterial viral fungal and parasitic infections than females who also mount a more robust response to antigenic challenges including infection and vaccination 7578 we davis et al have used machine learning approaches to identify a cluster of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis previously shown to be upregulated by testosterone which correlates with poor virus-neutralizing activity in men 79 interestingly the stronger immune response in females is thought to explain why females are more prone to immune-mediated pathologies including autoimmune disease and cytokine storm 78 however in the case of covid-19 there is no data to currently support a female-predominance toward cytokine storm if anything males are prone to more severe disease and mortality 74 thus it would be important to gather more data and larger number cohort studies on the current sars-cov-2 pandemic to study further delineate whether there is a gender-dependent risk for cytokine storm and subsequent cardiac injury in covid-19 infectionvarious therapies have emerged to treat the various aspects of viral pathogenesis and subsequent immune response and an understanding of which aspect of disease pathogenesis they target may aide the clinician in knowing when to use them treatments which target steps early in the infection process respiratory phase in fig 1 are meant to suppress viral replication and aid the host immune response to fight the virus when the immune response becomes hyperactive sepsisshock phase in fig 1 with cytokine storm immunomodulators that target various harmful inflammatory cytokines may help mitigate end-organ toxicity unfortunately there are currently no fda-approved therapies for sars-cov-2 and no substantial randomized trial data to support any therapy thus far however several promising therapies are actively being test in patients including the recently announced multi-center randomized solidarity trial remdesivir hydroxychloroquine sponsored by the world health organization 51anti-microbial agents which target the early pre-systemic phase of infection include remdesivir hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin remdesivir is a drug which targets the rna polymerase suppresses viral replication and has strong in vitro evidence of efficacy against sars-cov-2 26 although randomized trial data are still pending 51 there have been anecdotal reports of improvement after compassionate use of remdesivir 80 lopinavir-ritonavir is another rna polymerase inhibitor which showed initial promise but a recently published study from beijing showed no significant difference in the treatment versus control group suggesting that the effect if present was insufficient to cause a significant clinical response 81 chloroquine has traditionally been used as an anti-malaria drug but has shown reasonable efficacy against sars-cov-2 in vitro 26 a single arm study of 20 covid-19-positive patients treated in france demonstrated some efficacy for the combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine a safer variation of chloroquine in sars-cov-2 80 another small non-randomized study showed similar results 82 however these were small non-randomized studies in whose definition of efficacy was based on viral clearance rather than mortality benefit a subsequent pilot randomized trial in shanghai comparing hydroxychloroquine and placebo has shown no difference in virologic clearance 83 azithromycin is an antimicrobial agent generally used for antibacterial purposes however it also has been shown to inhibit zika virus tropism in the human brain and has been suggested as an adjunct for treatment of intra-cellular microbes in the past 80 81 since both chloroquinehydroxychloroquine and azithromycin lead to corrected qt qtc prolongation their use either alone or in combination should be monitored for this potential cardiotoxic side effect 84the second group of therapies is immunomodulators used to target immune hyperactivity and the cytokine storm that occurs in the later stages of covid-19 infection 64 monoclonal antibodies have shown some promise in early studies the il-6 inhibitors tocilizumab and sarilumab have shown early benefit and are being studied in ongoing randomized trials 51 other therapies including meplazumab anti-cd147 eculizumab targets complement adalimumab tnf- inhibitor and ivig saturation of fc receptors on macrophages suppression of chemokinescytokines are also intended toward reduction of deleterious immune effects 51 interestingly immune stimulatory agents aimed at enhancing beneficial aspects of the immune response are also being testedincluding ifn- 1a pd-1 inhibitors and donor convalescent plasma 51 there are conflicting data to support the use of glucocorticoids in covid-19 related ards 85 and even potential evidence of harm in the form of decreased viral clearance in sars and mers 86 and increased mortality in sars-cov2 87 without evidence of acute lymphocytic myocarditis in cardiovascular injury we do not currently advocate for the routine administration of glucocorticoids for elevated troponin in covid-19 patients randomized trials on both glucocorticoids and ivig in severe cases of covid-19 are ongoing 51sars-cov-2 has become a worldwide health threat with the numbers of infected patients growing rapidly an increased incidence of cardiac injury has been observed among those with severe infection the mechanism of cardiac injury is unclear but likely involves a combination of direct viral damage and immune-mediated damage by inflammatory cytokineschemokines and cytotoxic immune cell response in the later stages of infection the host immune response and contributors to cytokine storm in sars-cov-2 infection are complex significant depletion and dysregulation of t lymphocytes may contribute to immune dysregulation and hyperactivity cardiac damage in the setting of cytokine storm may be analogous to that seen in cardiotoxicity from car-t treatments for covid-19 are bimodal with one group of treatments targeted toward early infection and viral replication and another group targeted toward immune modulation in the later systemic inflammatory phase of infection with the advent of single cell immune phenotyping technologies it will be important to perform comprehensive immune surveys of infected patients to better understand systemic perturbations with the infection and downstream cardiovascular effects more data are needed to help guide us toward definitive treatment and protection of the cardiovascular system in covid-19 infectioncovid-19 is caused by coronavirus sars-cov-2 most cases of covid-19 are asymptomatic but some are severe and lethal mortality is the simplest marker of covid-19 vulnerability covid-19 vulnerability can be defined as a chance of death from covid-19 once infectedagein all studies conducted in all countries the mortality rate from covid-19 increases exponentially with age 111 exact mortality rates varied in hundreds of studies because they depend on testing and therapeutic interventions but the rule is clear the mortality rate is increasing exponentially with ageage-related diseasesmortality is especially high in patients with pre-existing conditions 6 9 10 1223in italy 99 of patients who died had at least one illness
httpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticles2020-03-1899-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-saysin other words infected people without pre-existing diseases do not die this may seem paradoxical because we just discussed that age is sufficient to increase mortality exponentially this is because pre-existing conditions are manifestations of biological age whereas aging and diseases are two sides of the same coin 2426 these conditions are typical age-related diseases hypertension diabetes obesity ischemic heart disease ihd and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and other diseases 9 1223of course not all only some patients with age-related diseases die from covid-19 in other words age-related diseases are necessary but not sufficient for mortality from covid-19age and pre-existing age-related diseases are interdependent a number and severity of diseases correlate with age an average 60 year old person has more age-related diseases than an average 50 your old person yet a particular 60 year old person may have no age-related diseases whereas a particular 50 year old person may have multiple diseases including hypertension diabetes obesity and cancer in this case it is a chronologically younger person who is biologically older and it is the biological age that determines the likelihood of death from covid-19male genderat the same age the mortality rate is twice higher in men than in women 9 27 28 in part because men age faster than women and at any chronological age men are biologically older than women 29so three rules can be combined in one covid-19 vulnerability is determined by biological age biological age combines chronological age age-related diseases and gender a combination of all age-related diseases and pre-diseases is a biomarker of biological age figuratively sars-cov-2 can measure biological age which is thus the best predictor of mortality from both covid-19 and other diseasesaging can be measured as an increase in the probability of death with age mortality increases exponentially starting from age 8-9 men have a higher normal age-related death rate than women because men age faster than women 29covid-19 mortality rate parallels the expected aging-related death rate supplementary figure 1 and see second graph in
httpsmediumcomwintoncentrehow-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196chances to die from covid-19 are proportional to chances to die from aging itself at any age the only discrepancy between natural and covid-19 mortality is observed below the age of 8 years old whereas natural death rate is relatively high covid-19 mortality is low no mortality 11 this discrepancy will be discussed later but first how do animals including humans die from aginghumans and other animals including the worm 30 and the fly 31 do not die from aging itself but from age-related diseases such as ischemic heart disease ihd hypertension diabetes cancer alzheimers and parkinsons diseases age-related macular degeneration osteoporosis and sarcopenia as we will discuss even seemingly non-deadly diseases such as osteoporosis can lead to deadly complications the incidence of these diseases increases exponentially with age some diseases such as obesity hypertension and diabetes develop earlier in the course of aging other diseases such as alzheimers disease and macular degeneration are usually diagnosed later 32 33 age-related diseases may also occur in younger people with genetic predisposition and environmental exposure hazards but even without these factors diseases develop because they are quasi-programmed see quasi-programmed aging section these diseases are not diseases of civilization as it may seem humans simply now live long enough to develop them of course hazards of civilization can accelerate them at a younger ageaging and its diseases cannot be separated healthy aging or aging without diseases is merely a slow aging when biological age is less than chronological age during a period of seemingly healthy aging pre-pre-diseases and pre-diseases are progressing until they eventually reach clinical manifestations thus healthy aging progress to unhealthy and pre-diseases become diseases 34age-related diseases and covid-19 vulnerability are highly intertwined patients who die from covid-19 otherwise would die from age-related diseases such as heart disease cancer diabetes hypertension just a year later covid-19 approximately doubles a patients aging-dependent risk of dying during one year for example numbers are very approximate a sixty year old woman has 1 chance to die from aging before her 61st birthday at that age if infected the death rate from covid-19 is around 1 for females if infected a patient has approximately doubled chances to die compared with usual age-related mortality during one year as david spiegelhalter put it getting covid-19 is like packing a years worth of risk into a week or two
httpsmediumcomwintoncentrehow-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196children and young adults have a very low risk of death from aging-related diseases so that risk remains extremely low even when doubledalthough natural mortality is relatively high in the youngest age group especially in infants they do not die from age-related diseases of course instead infants are vulnerable to bacterial infections and candida infections due to underdeveloped immune system 35 low covid-19 mortality in the pediatric age group 11 is consistent with the notion that covid-19 vulnerability is not due to a weak immune system in contrast as we will discuss in the next section it is hyper-functional immune response that leads to death from covid-19 in the elderly by causing cytokine stormsevere covid-19 is characterized by hyper-inflammation cytokine storm acute respiratory distress syndrome ards damage to the lung heart and kidneys 3639in response to viral replication hyperfunctional monocytes and macrophages infiltrate the lung causing hyper-inflammation and hyper-secretion of cytokines such as interleukin il-6 il-2 il-7 il-1ra interferon- inducible protein ip-10 tumor necrosis factor tnf- ferritin monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein mip 1- granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf c-reactive protein crp and procalcitonin 22 3642this leads to leukocyte recruitment vascular permeability edema and further pulmonary damage in vicious cycle 37 38 41 43 44 hyper-inflammation becomes systemic in turn causing hyper-coagulation and thrombosis disseminated intravascular coagulation 45 this causes injury of distant organs such as the kidneys pre-existing organ damage late stages of age-related diseases exacerbates organ damage caused by cytokine storm 42 43 46 in addition cellular hyper-functions and systemic hyper-inflammation may lead to cellular exhaustion such as exhaustion of lymphocytes lymphopenia 4749 hypercoagulation is associated with hyperactive fibrinolysis and increased d-dimer blood levels 23 cytokine storm is a systemic hyperfunctional response figure 1of course age-related hyperfunctional response such as cytokine storm is not caused by lifelong accumulation of molecular damage aging is not caused by molecular damage after all instead its a continuation of developmentalgrowth programs that lead to hyper-functions and in turn eventually to dysfunctionsquasi means resembling or seemingly but not really quasi-program of aging is not a program but a continuation of developmental programs that were not switched off upon their completion 24 50 they purposelessly unfold leading to age-related diseases secondary organ failure and death quasi-programmed program-like aging is associated with higher than optimal cellular and systemic functions which eventually via cellular exhaustion and organ damage lead to functional decline figure 2 for example starting from birth blood pressure increases and continues to increase after organismal growth is completed therefore hypertension is the most prevalent age-related disease in turn hypertension can cause organ damage stroke infarction and renal failure similarly obesity develops in post-development as a continuation of growth yet it can be prevented by low caloric diets illustrating that quasi-program of aging can be deceleratedhyperfunction is an excessive normal cellular function contraction by smooth muscle cells smc adhesion and aggregation by blood platelets insulin secretion by beta-cells lipid accumulation by adipocytes secretion by stromal and immune cells oxidative burst by leukocytes just to name a few when higher than optimal they cause vasoconstriction and hypertension thrombosis hyperinsulinemia hypertrophy hyperplasia obesity hyper-secretory phenotype or senescence-associated secretory phenotype sasp hyper-inflammation and so onhyper-function is not necessarily an absolutely increased function it may be also insufficiently decreased function relative hyperfunction levels of igf-1 and growth hormone decrease during lifespan despite this decrease igf-1 levels are still higher than optimal relative hyper-function because further genetic decrease in igf-1 levels by genetic means extends health span and lifespan in mammals 5153cellular hyperfunctions may eventually switch to cellular exhaustion and loss of functions at late stages during the course of type ii diabetes mtor overactivation and hyperinsulinemia eventually lead to beta-cell exhaustion and insulin insufficiency from pre-diabetes to diabetes 54 55 as another example after puberty hyperstimulation of the ovary eventually leads to oocyte exhaustion and menopause see figure 3 in ref 29 depletion of nave lymphocytes is another example as reviewed here later age-related alterations are mostly noticed when they switch to functional decline which is a late eventin some cases functional decline can be primary and programmed for example thymus involution replacement of t cells by adipocytes starts early in life accelerates at puberty and continues later still loss of thymocytes and their niches may be in part due to adipocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy 56 in fact obesity accelerates involution whereas calorie restriction decelerates it 57 58 furthermore the oblation of sex hormones decelerates or even reverses thymus involution 59 thus involution is triggered by adipocyte hyperplasia and increased production of sex hormones during puberty 56quasi-programmed aging is not driven by molecular damage it is driven by nutrienthormonecytokine-sensing and growth-promoting signaling pathways such as target of rapamycin tor mtor which are involved in developmental growth and later cause hyperfunctional aging and its diseases 24 26what is the cause-effect relationship between age-related diseases and covid-19 lethality do patients die from age-related diseases complicated by covid-19 or in contrast do these various diseases make covid-19 infection lethal both scenarios take place to some extent however the relationship is mostly indirect both age-related diseases and covid-vulnerability result from the same underlying cause figure 3 this is why they are highly correlated the cause is aging itself aging is manifested by a sum of deadly - and not so deadly - diseases and conditions ranging from cancer to grey hair although not all diseases seem to be deadly they can cause complications such as stroke ventricular fibrillation renal failure lung edema even sarcopenia and osteoporosis lead to falls and broken bones culminating in a deadly sequence of events cosmetic manifestations such as aging spots and wrinkles while not deadly by themselves can be manifestations of other diseases for example baldness correlates with prostate enlargement 60 and the later can lead to urinary obstruction and renal failurediseases occur together for example chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd is associated with diabetes cardiovascular disease and hypertension 61 if a person has one disease eg diabetes this patient has higher chances of having other diseases eg hypertension ihd cancer or conditions including covid-19 vulnerability which is revealed only during infection but can be predicted by pre-existing diseasesaging is initially driven by an increase in cellular and systemic functions hyperfunction leading to age-related conditions for example hypertension is a systemic hyperfunction due to hyperfunction of multiple cell types such as arterial smooth muscle cells asmc similarly covid-19-vulnerability is associated with hyperfunction of inflammatory cells that in response to covid-19 infection causes cytokine storm hyper-coagulation and damage of the lung and distant organsthe covid-19 vulnerability syndrome is an aging-related disease strictly dependent on biological age associated with other age-related diseases and exemplified by hyper-functional response to infectionwith hundreds of cell types acting in concert the immune system is so complex that we cannot discuss age-related alterations without oversimplification the most noticeable alteration is that memory t and b cells replace naive t and b cells 62 this seems natural since life-long exposure to pathogens replaces nave cells by memory cells replacement of nave immune cells decreases adaptive responses to novel antigens such as sars-cov-2 in contrast immune protection by memory t cells from viral re-infection with known pathogens is usually increased with age 62immune responses are roughly divided into a innate responses carried mostly by neutrophils macrophages and nk cells which react to pathogen rapidly and nonspecifically and b adaptive responses carried by t and b lymphocytes which are delayed slower and specific eg antigen-specific clonal expansion of t and b lymphocytes and antibody production by b lymphocytes 6365 in the elderly immune responses to sars-cov-12 are stuck in innate immunity with insufficient progression to adaptive immunity 37 however decline in adaptive response such as antibody production plays little role in covid-19 mortality it is hyper-functional innate immunity hyper-inflammation cytokine storm and hyper-coagulation that lead to organ failure and death in agreement hyper inflammatory response rather than high virus numbers leads to death of sars-cov-infected old nonhuman primates 66aging is associated with diseases of immune hyper-function such as autoimmune disorders with paradoxical increase in certain signaling pathways and cytokine levels 6769in the elderly innate immune cells are in a state of sustained activation producing pro-inflammatory cytokines 67 7072 increased pro-inflammatory activity by the innate immune system especially by monocytesmacrophages is a state of alertness and hyper-reactivity on the cost of potential age-related inflammatory diseases 67 7072 whereas some functions are decreased others are increased according to the inflamm-aging concept innate immune system overtakes adaptive immune system in aging cause-effect relationships are bi-directional immunosenescence namely a decrease in adaptive response is a cause and consequence of inflamm-aging 67 7072we can consider inflamm-aging as an example of hyper-function while some functions are decreased others are increased hyper-function is damaging in analogy increased electric power without an adaptor would damage a laptop damaging hyper-functions can lead to loss of function and cellular exhaustion and vice versa loss of function may cause compensatory hyper-functions of another componentscellular senescence is a continuation of cellular growth when actual growth is completed 73 74 in proliferating cells cellular mass growth is balanced by cell division cells grow in size and then divide when the cell cycle is blocked eg p21 and p16 then growth-promoting pathways such as mtor and mapk drive conversion to senescence geroconversion 24 74 75 during geroconversion cells become hypertrophic and fat cellular functions increase hyper-secretion and lysosomal hyper-function are manifested by sasp and beta-gal staining hyper-activated growth-promoting pathways cause compensatory resistance to growth factorsinsulin permanent loss of re-proliferative potential 74 rapamycin everolimus pan-mtor and mapk inhibitors slows down geroconversion maintaining reversible quiescence instead of senescence 73 7688geroconversion is a continuation of cellular growth 73 74 similarly aging is a continuation of developmental growth see figure 1 in ref 89 when the developmental program is completed it becomes a quasi-program of aging as discussed in detail chronically activated nutrient-sensing and growth-promoting pathways drive age-related diseases culminating in organismal death 24 26age-related diseases are quasi-programmed aging is a common cause of age-related diseases a sum of all age-related diseases they are diseases of hyper-function secondary hypo-function and compensation reactions 25 they are deadly manifestations of agingfrom activation of cellular functions to systemic hyperfunctions from diseases to organ damage and death hyperfunction theory of quasi-programmed aging describes the sequence of events 26 and as discussed in 2006 suppression of aging by gero-suppressants such as rapamycin will prevent and treat all age-related diseases 24 this point of view is becoming widely accepted and in recent literature quasi-programmed model of diseases 2006 is called geroscience hypothesis 2 90if aging were functional decline due to accumulation of molecular damage then it would be near to impossible to restore functions and rejuvenate the immune system in contrast if functional decline is secondary to hyperfunctions see figure 2 in ref 89 these hyperfunctions can be suppressed pharmacologically to restore lost functions typical drugs are inhibitors of their targets rather than activators so they decrease functions of their targets by decreasing hyper-functions which otherwise lead to secondary loss of functions rapamycin may restore lost functions figure 4rapamycin improves vaccination against viruses such as influenza in old mice monkeys and humans 92100 importantly rapamycin increases pathogen-specific but not graft-reactive cd8 t cell responses 95 101 therefore rapamycin and everolimus can both be used to prevent donor organ rejection and improve adaptive immunity against new pathogens 96differentiation is an increase of tissue-specific cellular functions terminally differentiated b t and nk cells can rapidly react to already known pathogens 102 decrease in nave t and b lymphocytes and thus diminished response to novel antigens results in part from cellular hyper-differentiation in the immune system 64 103 hyper-functional differentiation can be counteracted by rapamycin 98as another example age-related exhaustion of stem cells is partially due to loss of quiescence caused by growth over-stimulation 92 104106 in general senescent cells characterized by hyper-proliferative drive coupled with cell cycle arrest 77 in young mice mtor hyper-activation causes senescence of hematopoietic stem cells hsc and decreases lymphopoiesis 92 in old mice rapamycin rejuvenates hematopoiesis and improves vaccination against influenza virus 92third production of lymphoid cells may be decreased because of disruption of hypoxic niches due to adipocytes hyperplasia 56 107 hypoxic niches can preserve hsc 108 109 probably because hypoxia inhibits mtor and cellular senescence 110 in agreement rapamycin preserves hscs 92 98 111 112 reduces the proportion of memory cells and maintains a pool of nave t cells 92 98fourth growth factor gf- and insulin-resistance is loss of function because cells cannot respond to gfinsulin but it may be caused by over-activated mtor which via s6kirs feedback loop blocks insulin and gf signaling rapamycin abrogates the loop restoring signaling 113118a high prevalence of age-related diseases often called diseases of civilization is a success story of modern medicine in the past most people did not live long enough to develop age-related diseases and those who developed them died soon after due to medical advances people survive to 85 on average despite suffering from age-related diseases standard medicine preferentially extends life span without necessarily affecting health span see figure 3 in ref 119 for example defibrillation and coronary stenting can save life but not cure heart disease it is anti-aging interventions that extend health span delaying diseases thus extending lifespan aging is a common cause of all age-related diseases by suppressing aging anti-aging interventions may delay all age-related diseases 119as a well-known example low calorie diets such as calorie restriction intermittent fasting and low carbohydrate diets extend both health and lifespan figuratively low calorie diets prolong life by improving health nutrients and obesity activate growth-promoting pathways eg mtor thus accelerating development of quasi-programmed age-related diseases obesity is associated with all age-related diseases from cancer to alzheimers and from diabetes to sarcopenia covid-19 vulnerability is also associated with obesity 9 19 20 22 according to hyperfunction theory obesity accelerates aging and all age-related conditions including covid-19 vulnerabilitydiabetes is one of main risk factors of death in covid-19 5 6 12 13 15 21 can type 2 diabetes an age-related disease be reversed in remarkable studies it was shown that a brief course 6-8 weeks of very low calorie diets vlcds can reverse type ii diabetes in one study vlcd reversed diabetes in 46 of patients with up to a 6-year history of diabetes 120 vlcd is most effective for its prevention and at early stages of diabetes 121 this anti-aging modality is so simple that remission can be achieved at home by health-motivated individuals 122 simultaneously it treats other age-related diseases such hypertension 123 obesity is associated with other diseases of hyperfunction from diabetes and sarcopenia to cancer and alzheimers disease since age-related diseases are predictors of covid-19 mortality vlcd in theory may decrease covid-19 vulnerabilityin the soil of easter island a complex bacteria produces anti-fungal antibiotic rapamycin to suppress yeast growth but as a by-product it also suppresses yeast aging quasi-programed aging is a continuation of growth approved for human use in 1999 rapamycin sirolimus and its close analog everolimus are widely used in several diseases including cancer and organ transplantation hundreds of clinical trials and twenty years of clinical practice have ensured their safety and good tolerability especially in healthy older adults 119currently several anti-aging clinics prescribe rapamycin out of label to prevent age-related diseases and slow aging hundreds of recent reviews discussed rapamycin and everolimus in detail so i will just emphasize a few pointsas soon as covid-19 epidemic started it become clear that covid-19 vulnerability is an aging-dependent condition and the use of rapamycin sirolimus was immediately suggested by independent researchers 1 3 133137 these proposals were based on a mixture of several rationales which need to be clearly distinguished in theory there are at least three independent applications of rapamycin and everolimus for covid-19 currently they all are still

httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04341675this review is intended for a professional audience to stimulate new ideas and to aid the global efforts to develop effective treatments for covid-19 disease this article does not represent medical advice or recommendations to patients the media should exercise caution and seek expert medical advice for interpretation when referring to this articlecovid-19 is the term used to describe the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars cov-2 it originated in december 2019 from wuhan hubei province in china and owing to its ability to be transmitted between humans via respiratory droplets1 has since spread globally within the united kingdom uk there have been mounting concerns regarding multiple reports of an elevated relative-risk of covid-19 mortality amongst the black and minority ethnic bame population2 3 4 5 after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and self-reported co-morbiditydisability the office for national statistics ons estimates that indian females are 143 times pakistani and bangladeshi males are 18 times and black males and females 19 times more likely to die from covid-19 relative to their white counterparts2 this pattern has broadly been reflected in uk critical care admission and outcome data from the intensive care national audit and research centre report6 as well as data from the united states of america usa7 an urgent national enquiry into the possible reasons for this phenomenon has thus been issuedsars cov-2 is a positive-sense enveloped single-stranded rna virus which can bind to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor in humans1

8 ace2 receptors are expressed widely throughout the body but it is believed that sars cov-2 uses ace2 receptors expressed on respiratory epithelial cells to gain entry into the host8 after entering the respiratory epithelium it can replicate to cause pyroptosis and thus the release of pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps and damage associated molecular patterns damps9 damps and pamps are recognised by the pattern recognition receptors of surrounding epithelial cells alveolar macrophages and vascular endothelial cells which respond by releasing a wide array of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as c-x-c motif chemokine-10 cxcl-10 interleukin-6 il-6 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 mip1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 mip1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp1 these inflammatory cytokines and chemokines can then recruit monocytes macrophages and t-cells to the local tissue which all release further pro-inflammatory cytokines in a positive feedback loop mechanism resulting in a cytokine storm8 evidence to support this was confirmed by the levels of various inflammatory cytokines such as il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor g- csf cxcl-10 mcp1 mip1 and tumour necrosis factor- tnf- being elevated in severe covid-19 patients who required critical care admission usually after the initial phase of viral infection10one of the major complications of covid-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which can lead to death by respiratory failure and is indeed associated with systemic inflammation11 the aforementioned cytokine storm can also lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure12

13 another emerging frequently fatal complication of covid-19 are venous thrombo-embolisms vte namely pulmonary embolisms pe which are hypothesized to arise due to the pro-inflammatory and hypercoagulable state described extensively in the literature14 peak il-6 levels have now been directly associated with covid-19 disease severity15 and tocilizumab an il-6 inhibitor is amongst many other promising anti-inflammatory drugs undergoing clinical trials to treat covid-1916

17 inflammation is thus at the forefront of covid-19 research18 and it is postulated that disease severity and outcomes correlate with pro-inflammatory cytokine dysregulation19

20 we therefore undertook the synthesis of a narrative review which aims to shed light on the novel acute-on-chronic pathophysiological role of inflammation in contributing towards the increased mortality risk of covid-19 amongst the bame population we propose that the bame population may be subjected to elevated levels of chronic systemic inflammation due to various reasons discussed which may augment the acute covid-19 cytokine storm described to potentiate multi-organ failure and deathrelevant studies were identified by searching medline pubmed scopus medrxiv and google scholar to identify articles published in english from inception to 18th june 2020 the search terms included one of covid-19 or black and minority ethnic or inflammation and one of obesity or diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular disease or psychological stress or chronic infection or genetic the reference list of each study identified in the initial database search and the library of each co-author was also reviewed to identify any potentially relevant studiestitles abstracts and key words of the studies identified in the electronic search were screened for eligibility to be included in this narrative review all studies deemed relevant were retrieved a standardized checklist was then used to determine the eligibility for inclusion in the review based on information within the full article original research articles were selected to participate in this study if they were relevant to our study hypothesis and contained the highest quality of evidence pertaining a given subject systematic reviews were used preferentially where possible studies confined to local indigenous populations or published before the year 2000 were excluded key epidemiological data was also extracted from government reportsa narrative review was synthesized using the included articles in order to summarize key information hypothesize pathophysiological mechanisms draw inferences and suggest recommendations for public health policymetabolic syndrome is an inflammatory condition which encompasses insulin resistance hypertension and obesity all of which have been associated with covid-19 severity a recent meta-analysis in china of 1527 covid-19 patients concluded that those with cardio-metabolic co-morbidity were at a significantly greater risk and had poorer prognosis21 another meta-analysis of 76993 hospitalized covid-19 patients reported concordant data suggesting that 1637 1211 and 787 of patients had hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus respectively all key components of metabolic syndrome22 similarly preliminary data from national health service nhs england has shown a higher prevalence of diabetes 19 and chronic cardiac disease 29 as well as an association between obesity and mortality amongst 16749 hospitalized uk patients with covid-1923 in the usa the hispanic and black populations are also subjected to higher risks of metabolic syndrome24 and also incidentally have poorer prognoses due to covid-19 in preliminary reports7 the association between the metabolic syndrome and covid-19 is not fully understood but due to the extensive role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome25

26 we build on existing evidence to suggest a potential pathophysiological role for systemic chronic inflammation from metabolic syndrome in order to explain the disproportionate effect of covid-19 on the bame populationinsulin resistance and subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm can both be described as inflammatory diseases owing to their association with elevated inflammatory cytokines such as tnf27 afflicting uk minority ethnics 2-5 times more frequently28 a large cross-sectional study looking at 4976 children aged 9-10 years old within the uk has shown that biochemical markers of insulin resistance were significantly raised in ethnic minority children compared to caucasian children29 this suggests that from childhood itself metabolic risk in the bame population is higher and indeed there is evidence to suggest a genetic predisposition to metabolic syndrome amongst the bame population30 nice recommendations provide different guidelines based on ethnicity for managing t2dm and also state that the threshold body mass index bmi to define high risk is 30 for a white individual but 275 for an asian31

32obesity like t2dm has also been associated with severe covid-19 the requirement for non-invasive mechanical ventilation and death33 34 35 36 in the uk 728 of black adults were overweight or obese in 2017-2018 compared to 629 of white adults37 asians and blacks were also significantly more likely to be physically inactive and have unhealthier diets compared to whites38 39 40 thus suggesting a heavy influence of socioeconomic and psychological factors not only can obesity impair lung function via obesity hypoventilation syndrome ohs41 but it can also contribute to the development of obstructive sleep apnoea osa which is indeed more prevalent amongst blacks in the usa42 osa has been associated with an exacerbation of metabolic syndrome43 44 45 increased intubation risks46 and respiratory failure47 furthermore obesity can contribute to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease nafld which is more commonly found in ethnic minorities48

49 thus during a covid-19 cytokine storm patients with nafld may be more prone to acute-on-chronic liver failure50obesity and insulin resistance can both also contribute to a chronic inflammatory state which may potentiate a cytokine storm within the context of an acute covid-19 infection excess fat in particular visceral fat which is broadly measured by waist circumference has been associated with chronic systemic inflammation51 and covid-19 severity36 in addition preliminary reports have suggested that a 1dm2 increase in visceral fat area amongst patients with covid-19 is associated with an over 22 times higher risk of being admitted to critical care52 south asians have indeed been found to have greater proportions of visceral fat compared to europeans53 as adipose tissue grows it can receive a reduced blood supply and thus be subject to hypoxia necrosis and subsequent inflammation51 inflamed adipose tissue as well as visceral adiposity secrete more adipokines such as leptin resistin retinol bindingprotein-4 and visfatin as well as less adiponectin all of which can contribute to elevated systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- il-6 il-1 mcp-1 and the complement cascade54 55 56 this adipokine induced pro-inflammatory state amongst the obese has not only been associated with increased risks of atherosclerosis acute coronary syndrome cancer insulin resistance hypertension and venous thrombo-embolism51

57 but can also stimulate further adipokine dysregulation via a positive feedback loop mechanism58patients with hypertension have been found to be 25 times more likely to develop severe covid-1959

60 similarly dyslipidaemia has also been associated with a poor prognosis in patients with covid-1961 it is already well established in the literature that ethnic minority populations are more predisposed to dyslipidaemia62

63 and hypertension64 65 66 both of which are key cardiovascular risk factors associated with chronic inflammation67

68 the mechanism by which covid-19 worsens the prognosis in patients with cardiovascular risk is unknown but multiple studies have emerged indicating higher troponin levels69 in patients with severe covid-1970 71 72 one hypothesis as to how this may occur states that sars cov-2 enters myocardial cells via the ace2 receptor from where it causes direct myocardial injury73 74 75 alternatively since seasonal influenza has been associated with a higher incidence of acute coronary syndrome acs76

77 reports have suggested that covid-19 may be acting similarly attempts to explain this phenomenon have referred to the pro-inflammatory cytokine dysregulation triggered by active seasonal influenza infection which can cause acute vascular endothelium dysfunction atherosclerotic plaque destabilization tachycardia and hypercoagulability all of which increase the risk of acs76

77 if covid-19 is indeed acting similarly via vascular endothelium dysfunction78 individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors such as the bame population will be at a higher risk of acspsychological stress and mental health disorders have been strongly associated with systemic inflammatory cytokine dysregulation79

80 as well as systemic oxidative stress81 82 83 across multiple systematic reviews in fact psychosocial trauma occurring at any point in a lifetime has been associated with increased levels of systemic inflammation markers such as tnf- il-6 c-reactive protein crp and resistin84 qualitative reports have suggested higher levels of psychological stress amongst ethnic minorities85 and indeed meta-analysis research has suggested that both acute and chronic stress have been associated with decreased cellular and humoral immunity86 there are possibly three key reasons as to why the bame population experience increased levels of psychological stress i mental health disorders ii socioeconomic inequalities and iii occupational hazardsamongst the bame population there is a greater social stigma attributed to mental health disorders often making it harder for minority ethnics to present with mental health issues to healthcare providers87

88 indeed in the usa social stigma and cultural barriers to help-seeking behaviour amongst african americans with mental health issues is well evidenced89

90 and may explain why mental health services are less utilized by the african american population91 however data is now emerging that mental health disorders may be more prevalent amongst the bame population in the uk reflected by the greater incidence of psychiatric detention amongst minority ethnics92 mental health issues can not only contribute to but can also be precipitated by psychological stress that has been caused by traumatic life experience for example incarceration has been associated with psychological stress as well as mental health issues and indeed there is a higher relative representation of blacks in uk93 and usa91 prisonssecondly deprivation and poverty especially during childhood years can contribute to psychological stress94 inflammation95

96 and now additionally covid-19 mortality97 ons data has shown that pakistani bangladeshi and black populations within the uk have the lowest median gross hourly earnings98 due to poverty as well as cultural factors the bame population are more likely to live in overcrowded and multi-generational households which is as high as 9 more than caucasians amongst the 34-55 year age category99 furthermore densely populated urban areas such as london suffered the most deaths from covid-19 and likewise the population of london also comprises of over 40 bame100 not only does overcrowded housing and inner-city living pose a huge impediment for social distancing but they are also both associated with psychological stress mental health disorder and inflammation101 102 103finally whilst 63 of covid-19 related deaths amongst nhs frontline staff were bame104 only 208 of the nhs workforce are bame105 this highlights an enormous relative risk which is greater than that of the general bame population raising questions regarding occupational hazard this may partially be explained by the fact that frontline nhs workers are more likely to be exposed to higher viral loads of covid-19 however healthcare workers can often experience psychological stress and burn-out106 and there is now emerging evidence that bame nhs staff may encounter greater work-related psychological stress107 amongst the non-medical nhs workforce a hierarchal correlation can be observed whereby the prevalence of white staff positively and bame staff negatively correlate with seniority105 indeed a lack of decision making has been identified as a potent source of occupation-related psychological stress108

109 similarly various other occupations such as chefs taxi drivers and security guards have all also encountered a disproportionately higher number of covid-19 related deaths110 these occupations not only contain higher representations of minority ethnics amongst staff111 but may also involve less decision making as well as more night shifts sedentary work and viral load exposureoverall the mechanism as to how psychological stress can contribute to chronic inflammation is yet to be fully elucidated but there are two mechanisms that have been described in the literature i neuroendocrine-immune crosstalk and ii unhealthy behaviours firstly glaser et al explain that negative emotions negative life events and psychological stress can all activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hpa and direct sympathetic innervation of lymphoid organs activation of the hpa contributes to elevated levels of glucocorticoids in circulation such as cortisol adrenocorticotropic hormone prolactin and growth hormone all of which can bind to respective receptors on various leukocytes thus modulating their function the hpa also increases circulating adrenaline and noradrenaline which can activate the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis sam direct sympathetic activation of lymphoid organs coupled with activation of the sam can both also modulate immune cell function immune cell modulation may contribute to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il- 1 which can then trigger a positive feedback loop mechanism to exacerbate neuroinflammation and subsequent hpa stimulation112 supporting this notion of neuroendocrine-immune crosstalk there are promising ongoing clinical trials evaluating the use of anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of mental health disorders113

114 secondly the unhealthy behaviours arising from psychological stress and mental health disorder are vast but may include sleep disruption115 unhealthy diets and physical inactivity which are more prevalent in bame populations38 39 40 substance abuse116 impulsivity and risk-taking which can all further contribute towards chronic inflammation117 118 119 the aforementioned mechanisms may provide insight as to how psychological stress can contribute to the pathophysiology of inflammatory co-morbidities such as chronic infections120

121 cardiometabolic disease122

123 and perhaps additionally via reducing the threshold to trigger a cytokine storm covid-19in addition to the well evidenced pathophysiological mechanisms discussed above there may also be a smaller role played by chronic infections such as tuberculosis tb chronic hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus hiv which are more prevalent in migrants from developing countries124 125 126 127 tb is known to contribute to various chronic lung changes such as cavitation fibrosis bronchiectasis and impairment in lung function all of which may contribute to impaired pulmonary immunity128 thus potentially increasing the risk of other respiratory tract infections such as covid-19 there is now also a growing body of evidence implicating hepatic impairment in covid-1910

129 although the overall prevalence of chronic hepatitis infection in the uk and usa is low it is possible that covid-19 could exacerbate underlying hepatitis b or c which may trigger acute-on-chronic liver failure amongst the bame population finally despite its association with cardiometabolic disease130

131 preliminary reports have indicated similar outcomes from covid-19 amongst patients with hiv compared to the general population on the other hand these hiv patients were all also on anti-retroviral treatment which may have conferred cross-protection against covid-19132 overall tb hiv and hepatitis are all associated with a chronic elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokines133 134 135 and this may reduce the threshold for triggering a cytokine storm with concomitant covid-19 infection as shown in figure 1
 although the evidence is unclear and requiring further studyellinghaus et al describe an association between the severe covid-19 phenotype and the 3p2131 and 9q342 gene clusters suggesting a genetic predisposition to covid-19 mortality136 there is also genetic evidence to suggest that the innate immune response can vary amongst different ethnicities ndlec et al report that 93 of macrophage-expressed genes show ancestry-associated differences in the gene regulatory response to infection and in black africans there may be a more potent inflammatory response to infection137

138 to support this a cross-sectional study of 508 black and white adults demonstrated significantly higher il-6 and crp levels amongst the black participants139 furthermore patients with sickle cell disease scd are explicitly warned about heightened risks during the current pandemic situation140 and there is mounting concern amongst the bame population as scd affects predominantly black africans141 elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been well characterized in scd142 and within the context of a superimposed covid-19 infection may contribute towards an increased risk of sickle-cell crises coagulopathy systemic vasculopathy and functional asplenia related immunocompromise140based on the pathophysiological mechanisms identified in this review as well as the surrounding literature suggested multi-disciplinary interventions to reduce the health inequalities highlighted by the covid-19 pandemic have been summarized in table 1
belowthe mechanisms discussed throughout this review have been summarized in figure 1 belowthis review aims to shed light on the ongoing national enquiry investigating the disproportionate effect of covid-19 on the bame population for the first time inflammation has been discussed in a common framework with regards to covid-19 and ethnicity we suggest a novel pathophysiological mechanism by which acute inflammation arising from covid-19 may augment existing chronic inflammation secondary to medical co-morbidity in order to potentiate a cytokine storm and thus the more severe disease phenotype observed in the bame population obesity insulin resistance cardiovascular disease psychological stress chronic infections and genetic predispositions are all relevant factors which may be contributing to elevated chronic systemic inflammation amongst the bame population we suggest various interventions to reduce the prevalence of the severe covid-19 disease phenotype amongst the bame populationthere is no funding to declarethere are no relevant conflicts of interest to declarein the past decades two known pathogenic human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome cov sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome cov mers-cov have been reported to damage the respiratory tract and cause high morbidity and mortality 1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a newly discovered coronavirus was reported at december 2019 2019-ncov in the city wuhan hubei province china 2 up to 21th of march 2020 81416 cases have been reported with 3261 fatal cases according to the chinese center for disease control and prevention cdc meanwhile 190000 cases have been reported with 7992 fatal cases in other countries except china in italy to date there are about 47021 infected and 4032 deaths 3 a global outbreak of the sars-cov-2 caused corona virus disease covid-19 seems inevitable among these covid-19 patients most of them have the common symptoms including fever cough and myalgia or fatigue at onset the majority of patients can recover however about 25 of patients will progress into severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which may worsen rapidly into respiratory failure need an intensive care unit icu and even cause multiple organ failure 4 5 therefore the exploration for the mortality causes and advancing novel therapeutic development of severe covid-19 is crucially important at the momentalthough virus-induced cytopathic effects and viral evasion of host immune responses are believed to be important in disease severity studies from humans who died of sars and mers suggested that an aberrant host immune response resulting in an inflammatory cytokine storm and lethal disease 1 similar to the inflammatory cytokines in sars and mers patients with covid-19 also have increased plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor  tnf-interleukins il 2 7 and 10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha and interferon--inducible protein 10 especially in icu patients which implied a cytokine storm occurred 4moreover covid-19 patients have decreased lymphocytes in peripheral blood and characteristic pulmonary ground glass changes on imaging 4 5 most importantly in the biopsy samples at autopsy from patients who died from covid-19 histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage including edema proteinaceous exudate focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration and multinucleated giant cells 6 7 it also has been recovered from autopsy examination that type ii alveolar epithelial cells proliferate markedly with some cells exfoliated the alveolar septum is hyperemic edematous with clear intravascular thrombosis focal monocytes lymphocytes and plasma cells are infiltrating into pulmonary interstitium immunohistochemistry results showed positive for immunity cells including cd3 cd4 cd8 cd20 cd79a cd5 cd38 and cd68 8 these phenomena further suggest severe pulmonary inflammatory immune cells exist in sars-cov-2 infection therefore increased alveolar exudate caused by aberrant host immune response and inflammatory cytokine storm probably impedes alveolar gas exchange and contributes to the high mortality of severe covid-19 patientsinflammatory storm refers to an excessive inflammatory response flaring out of control and the immune system gone awry to identify which kind of immune cells are involved in and which inflammatory cytokine is the critical target in these severe covid-19 patients we analyzed peripheral blood samples from patients with severe or critical covid-19 from the first affiliated hospital of university of science and technology of china and observed monocytes and t cells from severe or critical covid-19 patients decreased significantly compared to normal controls these aberrant pathogenic t cells from critical icu care covid-19 patients showed activated characteristic accompanied with co-expressing ifn- and gm-csf this phenomenon aroused our alarm for gm-csf has the capability to control diverse pathogenic capabilities of inflammatory myeloid cells especially monocytes 9 as expected inflammatory monocyte with cd14cd16 phenotype exists in peripheral blood of covid-19 patients and has larger population in critical covid-19 patients from icu note that without any re-stimulation with pma or incubation with monensin large amount of il-6 could be tested from these inflammatory monocytes especially in icu patients therefore these pathogenic th1 cells gm-csfifn- and inflammatory monocytes cd14cd16 with high expression of il-6 exist especially in critical icu covid-19 patients 10 given that large amount of mononuclear inflammatory lymphocytes have been observed in the biopsy samples at autopsy from covid-19 patients we believe that these pathogenic t cells and inflammatory monocytes may enter the pulmonary circulation in large numbers and incite inflammatory storm in severe or critical covid-19 patients fig 1tocilizumab is the first marketed il-6 blocking antibody through targeting il-6 receptors and has proved its safety and effectiveness in therapy for rheumatoid arthritis fig 2 in order to verify whether targeted il-6 may potentially be the effective and safe way to reduce mortality of covid-19 21 patients diagnosed as severe or critical covid-19 from the first affiliated hospital of university of science and technology of china and anhui fuyang second peoples hospital were recruited and given tocilizumab therapy table 1 patients received standard treatment according to the diagnosis and treatment protocol for covid-19 7th edition including lopinavir methylprednisolone other symptom relievers and oxygen therapy the results of tocilizumab treatment are inspiring the temperature of all the patients returned to normal very quickly the respiratory function and all other symptoms improved remarkably among these 21 patients 20 patients have been recovered and discharged within 2 weeks after the tocilizumab therapy one left patient is recovering and out of icu care no adverse drug reactions were reported during the treatment with tocilizumab 11 with these promising preliminary clinical results we further launched the multicenter large-scale clinical trials chictr2000029765 and have already about 500 severe or critical patients treated this waythe immunotherapy strategy about tocilizumab treatment has been formally included in the diagnosis and treatment program of covid-19 7th edition of the national health commission of china since 3th march 2020 as following tocilizumab can be used in patients with extensive bilateral lung lesions opacity or in severe or critical patients who have elevated laboratory detected il-6 levels the first dose is 48 mgkg the recommended dose is 400 mg diluted to 100 ml with 09 normal saline and the infusion time is more than 1 h for patients with poor initial efficacy an additional application can be made after 12 h the dose is the same as before the maximum number of times of administration is two and the maximum dose of a single dose should not exceed 800 mg note that patients with allergic reactions such as tuberculosis and other active infection are contraindicated we suggest that il-6 concentrations can be detected if fever persists for more than 3 days by chemiluminescence detection if serum il-6 content is over 20 pgml tocilizumab can be used the il-6 will be temporarily increased in serum in the next few days for its receptors have been blocked by tocilizumab together tocilizumab treatment is recommended to reduce the mortality of severe covid-19all three coronaviruses including sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 induce aberrant non-effective host immune responses that are associated with severe lung pathology the new sars-cov-2 additionally causes serious alveolar mucus infiltration and multiple organ failure as the sars-cov-2 continues to spread the numbers of fatal cases rise exponentially in many countries advancing novel therapeutic development becomes crucial to minimize the number of deaths from covid-19 in the absence of specific antiviral drugs existing host-directed therapies could potentially be repurposed to treat covid-19 chinas plan of tocilizumab treatment has shown its remarkable effectiveness and safety in clinical practice over the past 2 months hoping it will benefit other countries fighting the pandemic and reduce the mortality of severe covid-19 as well
in december 2019 pneumonia cases of unknown origins known as novel coronavirus pneumonia ncp occurred in wuhan hubei province china the world health organization has recently officially named ncp as coronavirus disease in 2019 covid19

 in the following month the disease spread rapidly from wuhan to other cities so far more than 70 000 covid19 cases have been confirmed in china internationally cases have been reported in 24 countries and 5 continents patients clinical manifestations mainly included fever fatigue nonproductive cough and dyspnea patients laboratory examinations included normal or reduced leukocyte count reduced lymphocyte count thrombocytopenia elevated transaminase elevated lactate dehydrogenase ldh elevated creatine kinase and elevated myoglobin reduced lymphocyte count can occur in some severe cases

 at present there is no effective therapy for covid19 therefore the group of diseases and the assessment of prognosis become more and more important

lopinavir was available treatment measures of severe cases and critically ill cases were different from nonsevere cases on the basis of symptomatic treatment preventing complications preventing secondary infections respiratory support circulatory support was necessary symptomatic treatment was given in cases of reduced lymphocyte count and thrombocytopeniathe information recorded included demographic data medical history symptoms signs laboratory findings chest computed tomographic scans and treatment measures the samples for peripheral blood were collected on admission and during the hospital stay lymphocytes platelets alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase and ldh were detected in the clinical laboratory of huizhou municipal central hospital on the basis of the patients blood routine plr was calculated multivariate analysis of independent risk factors and relationship between plr and prognosisdata are presented as mean and standard deviation unless stated otherwise the nonparametric twotailed student t test was used to analyze variables differences in values between tested groups were regarded as significant at a value of p  05 correlation analysis used simple linear correlation multifactor logistic regression analysis data were analyzed using spss 25 the optimal cutoff value sensitivity sensitivity and specificity specificity of plr were determined by analysis of receiver operating characteristic roc curve the statistical graphs were drawn using graphpad prism 6 softwarethere were a total of 30 patients admitted with a median age of 505 years 3665 years including 16 males and 14 females there were 27 cases in the nonsevere group and 3 cases in the severe group patients in the severe group are olderthe correlation between two groups in terms of age length of hospitalization the absolute value of lymphocytes platelets and so on are shown in table 1 and figures 1 and 2 table 1 shows the difference between nonsevere group and severe group in the average age 4944 vs 60 years and the average length of hospitalization 1533 vs 27 days the statistics of two groups was statistical significance p  05 we also analyze some other indicators between the two groups such as platelet value absolute lymphocyte values plr alt and ast ldh at admission but there are no significance between them unexpectedly comparing the peak of platelet it was found that the average platelet peak during the treatment of severe patients was 392  109l which was significantly higher than the nonsevere patients at 301  109l the plr was 626 which was significantly higher than the plr of nonsevere patients which was 262 the date of the two groups was statistically significant p  05 in terms of hormone use a total of 18 nonsevere patients used hormones during treatment accounting for 667 of nonsevere patients and 3 of the severe patients had used hormones accounting for 100 but these two groups of data have no statistical significance multivariate logistic regression analysis of age platelet peak and plr at platelet peak during treatment showed that plr at platelet peak during treatment was an independent influencing factor for critically ill patients the results are shown in table 2figure 3 shows the trend of platelet in three severe patients we found the same trend in three nonsevere patients and their platelet value was above 300  109l the platelet peak of group a was above 300  109l during the treatment the platelet peak of group b was under 300  109l during the treatment as shown in table 3 patients in group a was older than patients in group b patients in group a had longer average hospitalization day the difference between the two groups is statistically significant p  05comparing the correlation between the difference plr the plr at the time of admission and the maximum of plr during treatment and the length of hospitalization day the data are shown in table 4 the average plr in severe patients was 46624  47186 while in nonsevere patients was 1961  13040 by comparison we found that the patients plr was correlated with the length of hospitalization day if plr increased more during treatment the patient had longer hospitalization day and a greater possibility of severe pneumonia on the contrary if plr increased less during treatment the patient had shorter hospitalization day endless possibility of severe pneumonia as shown in figure 4 by drawing the roc curve we can know that the cutoff value of plr is 1267 the sensitivity is 100 the specificity is 815 p  014 in clinical treatment when the plr value is greater than 1267 we should raise our vigilance patients may appear to increase the length of hospital stay and worsen the conditioncovid19 is an acute infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus sarscov2 the first symptom of most patients is fever and some patients may not have a fever in the early stage only chills respiratory symptoms mild dry cough fatigue poor breathing and diarrhea patients may gradually develop dyspnea in severe cases the disease progresses rapidly mods septic shock difficult to correct metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction may occur within a few days some patients have severe inflammatory storms leading to death

 therefore judging the development trend and prognosis of the disease at an early stage and taking active and effective treatment for patients who may develop into severe illness can effectively reduce the mortality ratethere are so many similarities between the outbreak of covid19 originated from wuhan and sars in guangdong province in 2003 for example they both occurred in winter and originated from the contact between live animals in the humananimal trading market and caused by an unknown coronavirus compared with sars they both are caused by human coronavirus infection although there are significant differences between 2019ncov and sarscov in genetic characteristics there are still many similarities in physical and chemical characteristics

 a retrospective analysis of sars patients showed that 68 to 90 of diagnosed patients had peripheral lymphocytopenia 20 to 45 had thrombocytopenia and 20 to 34 had leukopenia

 platelets are important immune cells in the human body which play an important role in hemostasis coagulation vascular integrity maintenance angiogenesis innate immunity inflammatory response tumor biology and so on changes in its number and activity are closely related to a variety of diseases
10
 
11
 platelets are produced by mature megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and current studies have shown that a variety of cytokines including tpo il3 il6 il9 il11 and stem cell factor scf can promote the production of megakaryocytes in vitro experiments the addition of mixed cytokines can stimulate the generation of megakaryocytes scf plays an important role in promoting the proliferation of megakaryocytes at the early stage of differentiation while il3 and tp0 play a synergistic role in the differentiation of megakaryocytes in state of inflammation il6 can promote the generation of megakaryocytes by stimulating the increase of tpo level

15
 the absolute value of lymphocytes and platelet levels can be used as sensitive indicators to reflect the bodys infection and inflammation control but can these indicators have the same clinical value for covid19therefore we analyzed the changes in peripheral blood of the covid19 patients in 2019 and the association between the changes and the survival and prognosis of the patients according to a report by zhongnan hospital affiliated to wuhan university
16
 the total number of white blood cells in the peripheral blood of these patients in the early stage of the disease was normal or decreased while the lymphocyte count was decreased liver damage and elevated inflammatory markers can occur in some patients our results show that the lymphocyte level at admission is related to the prognosis the older patients with a lower count of lymphocyte and platelet suffered more severe disease and stay in a longer hospital our results showed that the age and the platelet level of patients were positively correlated with the length of stayin hospital which was consistent with previous results while the lymphocyte level was negatively correlated with the length of in the hospital which was in contrast to previous reports the reason may be that the patients condition was stable on admission but they progressed further during treatment in addition it may be also related to the limited number of severe patients enrolled in this study routine changes in patients with covid19 are not the manifestations of common viral infection leukopenia neutropenia and an increase in lymphocyte proportion are not significantly changed in patients with a conventional general viral infection but the covid19 blood routine changes differentlyprevious studies have shown that severe infections immunerelated factors and other factors cause secondary thrombocytopenia such as dic ttp and hlh which are characterized by rapid platelet decline
17
 through the observation of patients included we found that platelets increased first and then decreased in severe patients during treatment and there were six patients with significantly increased platelets who were generally older and had longer hospital stays therefore we speculated that the changes in platelets in the treatment course may be correlated with the progression and prognosis of covid19the possible causes of platelet changes in covid19 patients were analyzed as follows a coronavirus directly invaded hematopoietic cells or bone marrow stromal cells leading to hematopoietic inhibition
18
 b previous studies have shown that the lung may be one of the organs in which mature megakaryocytes release platelets and that thrombocytopenia in patients with sarscov infection may be associated with lung damage
19
 
20
 extensive alveolar damage both occurred in patients with covid19 and sars and lung tissue damage was induced by a viral infection and high flow of oxygen injury of lung tissue and pulmonary endothelial cells can lead to activation aggregation and retention of platelets in the lung and the formation of thrombus at the injured site which may lead to the depletion of platelets and megakaryocytes resulting in decreased platelet production and increased consumption

 believed that patients with covid19 had a large amount of il1 ifn ip10 mcp1 and other cytokines released which may lead to th1 activation however compared with nonsevere patients severe cases had higher concentrations of cytokines such as gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1 and tnf suggesting that cytokine storm is related to the severity of the disease however unlike sarscov infection 2019ncov infection also causes increased secretion of th2 cytokines that inhibit th1 such as il4 and il10 in our results in severe cases the platelet significantly increased during treatment which may be linked to the release of a large number of cytokines by the immune system infection with 2019ncov causes cytokine storms in body fluids aggravating the patients inflammatory response and stimulating the release of platelets which often indicates a poor prognosis
23
 
24
 of course if the conditions permit highthroughput cytokine detection for covid19 patients to judge whether they are over immune activated it will be very convincing however because there is no 3p laboratory in the huizhou area that can send such special infected blood samples for examination so the testing for this item has to be abandoned the difference is not founded from the analysis of simple blood routine numerical data it is hoped that the future research direction is the correlation between blood routine changes and cytokines the correlation between cytokine storm severity and prognosis may be one of the mechanisms of covid19 which is involved in the occurrence development and prognosis of covid19 providing a new idea for the treatment of covid19
25
 
26
 however there are many factors that affect platelet changes in the clinic all patients in this study did not use invasive procedures such as tracheal intubation and deep vein catheterization therefore the impact of invasive procedures on platelet changes was not considered in this article
27
 it can be seen from the foregoing that the use of hormones during the treatment of patients is not significantly different between severe and nonsevere patients so their effects on platelets can also be ruled outas a new type of inflammation index plr mainly reflects the level of systemic inflammation previous studies have confirmed that plr is closely related to tumors diabetes coronary heart disease and connective tissue diseases and the increase of plr is related to tumor size lymph node infiltration distant metastasis and prognosis and can be used as a potential inflammatory indicator for the clinical diagnosis of communityacquired pneumonia
28
 as an indicator of inflammation plr is mainly caused by megakaryocytes in bone marrow hematopoietic tissue and is a major participant in thrombosis it plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response to recruit neutrophils and other inflammatory cells to the site of injury plt exists in an inactive form and can be activated quickly at the site of vascular injury and can be rapidly activated in response to proinflammatory cytokine or infectious factors the activation of platelets by this mechanism even without any vascular damage opens up new functions of platelets namely inflammation and immune regulation and the proinflammatory cytokine activity of plt is mediated by its interaction with other leukocytes in the circulation followed by the release of cytokines and chemokine to promote inflammation
29
 lymphocytes are the main immuneactive cells in the human body and lymphocyte count is an early marker of physiological stress and systemic inflammation plateletreleased platelet factor4 can prevent agglutinina from inhibiting lymphocyte generation and activated platelets enhance lymphocyte adhesion to the endothelium thereby promoting lymphocyte homing in endothelial veins and migration to inflammatory sites plr refers to the ratio of the platelettolymphocyte count the advantage of plr selection is that it reflects both aggregation and inflammatory pathways and maybe more valuable in predicting various inflammations than platelet or lymphocyte counts alonethe pathogenesis of covid19 is also related to the virusinduced inflammatory response in vivo

 according to the current clinical and relevant data patients with lower lymphocyte levels at the first diagnosis are more seriously ill and the progressive decline in lymphocyte proportion indicates a poor prognosis according to prior analysis we propose the plr as an indicator which reflects the severity of inflammation in the process of treatment by comparing the changes of plr during treatment we found that the higher the plr the longer the hospital stay they were of which showed a linear correlation therefore we speculated that the changes in the plateletlymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood during treatment could reflect the disease progression and prognosis of covid19 patients the larger the plr the more severe the cytokine storm and the longer the hospital stay the worse the prognosis when plr increases in severe patients we increase thymosin to regulate immune to elevate lymphocyte therapy to improve this situation to prevent the development of severe patients or promote the improvement of symptoms in severe patients after active symptomatic treatment all three severe patients were successfully treated and successfully discharged from the hospital the results of this treatment also seem to confirm our conjecture we also calculated the cutoff value of plr when plr  1267 we must actively intervene to prevent further deterioration of the disease however due to the lack of clinical data this conclusion may be biased and a larger number of samples are needed for further confirmationsinglecenter case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed covid19 in huizhou municipal central hospital presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have a suggestion on the severity and prognosis of the disease the patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer average hospitalization days may be related to the cytokine storm the plr of patients means the degree of cytokine storm which might provide a new indicator in the monitoring in patients with covid19all authors declare that there are no conflict of intereststhe authors of the manuscript declare contribution to the studycoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 virus may lead to a severe inflammatory response or cytokine storm 1 immune dysfunction in untreated crohns disease may augment the risk for a severe inflammatory response with covid-19 2 we describe a pediatric patient recently diagnosed with crohns disease who developed severe covid-19 infection successfully treated with infliximaba 14 year old male with recently diagnosed small bowel perianal crohns disease presented with 5 days of fevers and abdominal pain without respiratory symptoms physical exam was notable for tachycardia an erythematous maculopapular facial rash abdominal tenderness and a perianal lesion with purulent drainage initial laboratory tests revealed a c-reactive protein crp of 798 mgl normal 05 mgl an erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr of 64 mmhr normal 015 mmhr and hypoalbuminemia of 29 gdl sars-cov-2 pcr was positive magnetic resonance mr enterography revealed 28 cm of ileitis a 23 cm perianal abscess and fistula chest x-ray was negative for an acute pulmonary process blood culture and stool pcr were negative treatment was initiated with intravenous iv piperacillintazobactam for his perianal abscess hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for sars-cov-2 infection enoxaparin for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism and iv fluidson day 3 cytokine profile revealed elevated serum concentrations of interleukin il-6 of 736 normal 05 pgml il-8 of 431 normal 05 pgml and tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf- of 687 normal 022 pgml d-dimer and ferritin 214 gml fibrinogen equivalent units feu and 920 ngml respectively were also elevated fevers persisted despite a 3 and 5 day course of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine respectively drainage of the perianal abscess occurred on day 6elevated liver enzymes developed on day 7 with an aspartate aminotransferase ast of 145 ul alanine aminotransferase alt of 98 ul gamma-glutamyl transferase of 282 ul alkaline phosphatase of 199 ul and normal total bilirubin fevers persisted temperature maximum 393c with tachycardia and fluid refractory hypotension the rash also became purpuric with areas of confluence progressing initially from the face to the trunk upper and lower extremities including the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet antibiotics were switched to iv ciprofloxacin and metronidazole without improvement computed tomography ct scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis did not show any progression of perianal or ileal disease nor pulmonary infiltrates consistent with covid-19 but did reveal new findings of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegalyinfectious disease rheumatology dermatology cardiology and hematology were consulted on day 7 differential diagnosis at the time included a drug hypersensitivity reaction immune-mediated vasculitis viral infection atypical kawasaki disease and mis-c repeat concentrations of il-6 il-8 and tnf- were rising table 1 multidisciplinary discussion of potential therapeutic options included remdesivir an antiviral therapy and tocilizumab an il-6 inhibitor for the treatment of covid-19 iv immune globulin for the treatment of an immune-mediated vasculitis and infliximab an anti-tnf- therapy infliximab would address the management of crohns disease and potentially the cytokine storm attributable to mis-c associated with covid-19 given the possible dual role and rapid clinical deterioration he received 10 milligramskilogram mgkg of infliximab on day 8 without additional studies such as an echocardiogram or skin biopsy within hours fever tachycardia and hypotension resolvedcytokines improved with normalization of tnf- a decrease in il-6 and il-8 the progression of the rash was halted after infliximab treatment on hospitalization day 8 and significantly improved by discharge fig 1 crp normalized he was given a second infusion of infliximab10 mgkg prior to discharge 5 days after the initial dose due to a high inflammatory burden and presence of active perianal disease prometheus infliximab concentration prior to the second infusion was  34 ugml without antibodies follow up two weeks after discharge revealed complete resolution of clinical symptoms and normalization of all labs previously elevated
this is the first reported case of a patient with recently diagnosed crohns disease with suspected mis-c temporally related to covid-19 treated with infliximab to co-manage both entities despite surgical management of his active perianal disease and antibiotic therapy the patient continued to worsen clinically his clinical deterioration was unclear as both ibd and mis-c temporally related to covid-19 could be implicated with all other infectious studies negativepro-inflammatory cytokines tnf- il-1 and il-6 are overproduced in ibd patients 3 elevated levels of tnf- mean of 623 pgml have been described in the intestinal mucosa of ibd patients 4 serum concentration of tnf- and il-6 median 105 pgml and 415 pgml respectively are also associated with severe covid-19 illness 5 at the peak of our patients illness serum concentrations of tnf- 978 pgml and il-6 734 pgml were higher than is reported in either ibd or severe covid-19 inflammatory disease overlap possibly contributed to cytokine storm and mis-c cytokine storm has been found to be a major cause of morbidity in patients with severe covid-19 infection 15treatment targeting these pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 inhibition with tocilizumab have shown evidence of clinical benefit in subsets of severe covid-19 patients 6 tnf- is also implicated in severe covid-19 cases blockade of tnf- is effective in the treatment of auto-inflammatory conditions in which several cytokines are elevated suggesting anti-tnf- therapy alone may inhibit a cytokine cascade 7 currently therapy targeting tnf-a has not been associated with negative outcomes in ibd patients with covid-19 8 this case supports a role for blockade of tnf- in the treatment of covid-19 inflammatory cascade whether this is specific for immune dysfunction in the setting of ibd or the non-ibd covid-19 patient requires further investigationoverall increased tnf- levels are seen in cytokine storm due to covid-19 and in active ibd treatment with infliximab is known to be effective for the treatment of children with crohns disease and as evidenced by this case was effectual in halting a systemic inflammatory response in our patient with covid-19 the role of anti-tnf agents in patients with mis-c temporally related to covid-19 requires further investigation
