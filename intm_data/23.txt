clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 patients with hypertension on reninangiotensin system inhibitors xian zhou jingkang zhu tao xu   since december 2019 wuhan city hubei province has successively discovered multiple cases of patients with pneumonia infected by a novel type of coronavirus with the spread of the epidemic other cases in china and abroad have also been found as of march 21 2020 a total of 81054 covid-19 cases in china have been confirmed the new coronavirus belongs to the beta-type coronavirus which has an envelope and is round or oval usually polymorphic and 60140 nm in diameter its genetic characteristics are significantly different from sarsr-cov and mersr-cov current research shows that it has more than 85 homology with bat sars-like coronavirus bat-sl-covzc45 recently the international virus classification commission had proposal named the novel coronavirus as sars-cov-21 and the world health organization has officially named the novel coronavirus pneumonia as covid-19 at present it has been confirmed that receptor-binding mechanism in infection of host cells by novel coronavirus is the binding of the coronavirus s protein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 protein which involves in the regulation of blood pressure in the human body 2 it is widely present in the lungs heart kidneys and intestines additionally studies had reported that a considerable number of patients with covid-19 were complicated by underlying diseases such as hypertension and the proportion of patients with hypertension was high peng et al showed that among 138 covid-19 patients the proportion of patients with hypertension was the highest 43138 312 3 huang et al also found that 15 of patients with covid-19 had hypertension ranking second among all comorbidities 4 in addition there were reports that most of the deaths disclosed during the early stage of the covid-19 epidemic were complicated by hypertension however at present there were no researches about the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients with hypertension and the effects of taking acei or arb drugs on patients prognosis therefore we selected hypertension as a casecontrol retrospective study to investigate the clinical characteristics of hypertensive patients exposed to the covid-19 this case series was approved by the institutional ethics board of wuhan fourth hospital ky2020-027-01 all study cases were from confirmed patients with covid-19 at wuhan fourth hospital discharged from january 25 to february 20 2020 wuhan fourth hospital is located in wuhan hubei province which is one of the first batch of covid-19 diagnosis and treatment hospitals requisitioned by the wuhan municipal government all patients included in the study were diagnosed and treated in accordance with the covid-19 diagnosis and treatment program issued by the chinese national health committee the medical records of patients were collected and analyzed by the research team of the department of critical care medicine wuhan fourth hospital the clinical data included demographic data medical history underlying comorbidities symptoms signs laboratory findings treatment measures and clinical outcomes all study cases were grouped according to whether they had a history of hypertension then hypertensive patients were further divided into two groups based on whether to take acei or arb prism 5 graphpad software la jolla ca usa and spss 230 spss inc chicago il usa were used to perform statistical analysis means of two groups were tested for the statistical difference using unpaired students t-test the distribution of categorical variables was evaluated using chi-square test p  05 was considered statistically significant the association between whether to take acei or arb and prognosis in covid-19 patients with hypertension was examined by logistic regression analysis performed by spss the study included 110 patients with covid-19 who had been discharged the mean age of all patients was 577 years range 2586 years of which 60 545 male patients the most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever 94 855 dry cough 71 645 fatigue 38 345 and dyspnea 25 227 less common symptoms were pharyngalgia anorexia nausea vomiting diarrhea dizziness headache and myalgia patients with fever were mainly moderate fever 66 600 common underlying diseases included hypertension 36 327 diabetes 11 100 and cardiovascular disease 10 91 table 1
 as shown in table 2 compared to the non-hypertensive group patients in the hypertensive group were significantly older average age 648 vs 543 and showed a significantly higher occurrence of dyspnea 15 417 vs 10 135 diabetes 9 250 vs 227 and cardiovascular disease 7194 vs 341 remarkably the lymphocyte count on admission was significantly lower in the hypertensive group average value 096  109l vs 126  109l there was no statistical difference in the time from onset to hospitalization between the two groups clinical outcomes showed the two groups had no significant differences for crude cure rate the rate of referral to high-level hospitals and length of stay but the crude mortality rate was higher in the hypertensive group than that in the control group 7194 vs 227 taking acei or arb drugs may not change the prognosis of covid-19 patients with hypertension
 the covid-19 patients with a history of hypertension were divided into two groups according to whether to take acei or arb drugs of which 15 patients had previously taken acei or arb were divided into acei or arb group and other patients were divided as control group the patients in acei or arb group were younger than that in the control group and the difference was statistically significant average age 585 vs 692 while there were no significant differences in lymphocyte counts crude cure rate crude mortality rate onset time and length of hospital stay between the two groups table 3 we classify patients transfer to high-level hospital and clinical death as a poor prognosis and the prognosis between the two groups was examined by logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age sex hospitalization time time from onset to hospital admission and whether to take acei or arb as shown from table 4 whether to take acei or arb was not significantly associated with prognosis

 in this report we recruited 110 patients with covid-19 from the results we found that fever was the commonest symptom during the early stage besides the patient also showed other symptoms such as dry cough fatigue and dyspnea and so on in terms of underlying diseases hypertension was the commonest comorbidity 327 for the first time this report showed that compared to the non-hypertension group the hypertension group had significantly lower lymphocyte count in addition we grouped the covid-19 patients with a history of hypertension based on whether to take acei or arb for antihypertensive treatment and found that there was no difference in clinical outcomes between the two groups as reported by other researchers 46 for most patients with covid-19 the common symptoms were fever dry cough and fatigue but we should be alert to the clinical manifestations of a few patients without fever at the time of consultation besides we also should be wary of a few patients without clinical manifestations of the respiratory tract such as anorexia nausea vomiting diarrhea and other clinical manifestations of the digestive system as well as clinical manifestations of the nervous system such as dizziness and headache we observed about one-third of patients with covid-19 were complicated by hypertension this result was consistent with peng et al results which showed that 31 of 138 covid-19 cases had hypertension 3 until now there were no effective drugs for the treatment of covid-19 we observed that most patients used antiviral drugs arbidol tablets or lopinavir and ritonavir tablets and antibiotics and some patients used low-dose hormones methylprednisolone and immune globulin and some critically ill patients had used oxygen therapy in studies with limited conditions and data it can be seen that there was no difference in cure rate between the hypertension group and the non-hypertension group while the mortality rate in the hypertension group was higher and the prognosis seems to be worse however it should be noted that the patients in the hypertension group were older and had a higher proportion of major comorbidities which indicates that the elderly and comorbidities together constitute risk factors for poor prognosis to a certain extent blood pressure is affected by many molecules such as endothelin-1 7 angii etc 89 like angii ace2 belongs to the reninangiotensinaldosterone system and kallikreinbradykinin system family and is also a blood pressure regulating protein 1011 which can degrade angii to form ang1-7 and degrade des-arg 9 bradykinin dabk to an active peptide 12 as we all know angii and dabk can bind to corresponding receptors and play physiological roles such as constricting blood vessels promoting value-added inflammation neutrophil infiltration and pulmonary fibrosis 1213 while ang1-7 can bind to specific mas receptors and exert diastolic blood vessels anti-inflammatory anti-proliferative anti-fibrotic and anti-alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis therefore ace2 indirectly exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-lung injury effects animal experiments show that ace2 expression in hypertensive rats is decreased 1415 ace2 is also the binding protein of novel coronaviruses 16 like severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 17 in studies on sars researchers found that coronavirus can cause ace 2 levels to decline or even be absent 1819 but the expression of ace remains unchanged and the balance of ace2 and ace in lung is broken 20 leading to ang elevation and activation of the dabk-bk1 receptor pathway work together to cause lung inflammation apoptosis and accelerated lung injury because novel coronavirus and sars both use ace2 as a receptor we speculate that novel coronavirus and sars have similar mechanisms of action figure 1 reduced lymphocyte count is one of the diagnostic criteria in the national health commissions diagnosis and treatment program the results of this study show that covid-19 patients with a history of hypertension had lower lymphocyte count in reports by peng et al a persistent decline in lymphocyte counts was observed in death cases 3 chen et al also reported that patients with covid-19 who were over 50 years of age and low lymphocyte counts can easily turn into severe cases 21 maybe the lymphocyte count could reflect the severity of the condition in patients with covid-19 to some extent and this may explain the increased mortality in patients with a history of hypertension whether lymphopenia is due to the reduction of ace2 caused by novel coronavirus invasion in covid-19 patients with hypertension the increase of angii and des-arg bradykinin caused lung injury and inflammatory response needs further basic experimental research after scientists announced that novel coronavirus enters target cells through the receptor ace2 many experts in the cardiovascular field began to discuss whether covid-19 patients with a history of hypertension should continue to use acei or arb as antihypertensive drugs some scholars believe that aceis should be discontinued while other scholars believe that the recommendations to discontinue aceis have no scientific basis in our data analysis we saw that a considerable number of cases were complicated by hypertension so we further collected the patients previous medication situation and grouped them according to whether they were taking acei or arb drugs statistical analysis under limited data showed that the prognosis of the two groups was not statistically different but we need to note that there was a statistical difference in the age of the two groups further logistic regression analysis showed that patients whether had a history of taking acei or arb were not correlated with prognosis studies show that both acei and arb can cause increased expression of ace2 2223 as the angiotensin type i receptor arb can increase ang2 and then compensatingly increasing ace2 expression acei prevents ang1 from forming ang2 which in turn promotes ace2 expression but whether both types of drugs will affect covid-19 patients with hypertension require further research this study has several limitations first some patients had been referred to other hospitals so we can only calculate a crude cure rate and a crude mortality rate second this is only a single-center study and the sample size was also limited especially for patients with hypertension therefore it is difficult to accurately assess the risk factors for poor outcomes in general our current work demonstrated that in 110 discharged patients with confirmed covid-19 in wuhan china hypertensive patients had a significantly lower lymphocyte count on admission the elderly and comorbidities such as hypertension may together constitute risk factors for poor prognosis taking acei or arb drugs may not change the prognosis of covid-19 patients with hypertension however as mentioned above the sample size of the hypertensive patients we collected is small and more researches are needed to confirm it  covid19 and arterial hypertension hypothesis or evidence marijana tadic cesare cuspidi guido grassi giuseppe mancia   the first case of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 was reported in wuhan hubei province china on december 31 2019 until march coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 caused by this virus has spread around the world sarscov2 is human coronavirus which does not belong to the group of benign coronaviruses that cause common cold but to the smaller group of coronaviruses that cause acute respiratory distress syndrome severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirussars and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirusmers

 recently published studies showed that arterial hypertension diabetes cardiovascular diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were prevalent among the patients with covid19

 investigations on the outcome of these patients are scarce and data are very limited nevertheless hypertension is considered as one of the most important risk factors for covid19 the relationship between hypertension and adverse outcome is still questionable the aim of this review paper was to summarize current knowledge about the relationship between hypertension and covid19 and the role of hypertension in outcome of these patients a comprehensive search was performed on pubmed scopus web of science and google scholar to find review papers on this topic published until may 1 2020 sarscov2 infection is triggered when the sprotein of the virus binds to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 which is highly expressed in the heart lungs kidney and gastrointestinal tract and plays an important role in several cardiovascular and immune pathways
20
 sarscov2 binds to ace2 with much higher affinity compared to sarscov
21
 additionally sarscov2 shows its pathogenic activity by attacking type ii alveolar epithelial cells that are expressing ace2 previous studies of coronavirus that causes sars demonstrated that this virus binds to ace2 in pulmonary alveoli through their superficial spike proteins which causes lung damage and even lung function failure
21

 the loss of ace2 caused by binding sarscov2 may shift the system to an overall higher angiotensin ii and lower angiotensin17 tone the role of angiotensin ii in covid19 hypertensive patients seems to be crucial due to its role in functioning of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas that promotes vasoconstriction sodium retention oxidative stress inflammation and fibrosis and increases the bioactive peptide angiotensin17
22

 epidemiological data coming from china indicate that arterial hypertension cardiovascular diseases diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most prevalent concomitant diseases in patients with covid19

 it has still been debated whether hypertension was a predictor of mortality independently of other cardiovascular risk factors age obesity diabetes and comorbidities coronary artery disease heart failure atrial fibrillation cerebrovascular disease renal impairment the prevalence of hypertension among patients with covid19 between different studies ranged from 1520

 there are several reasons for these variations average age was significantly higher in patients with elevated prevalence of hypertension

 which might be the most important reason for different prevalence of hypertensive patients among studies advanced age was associated with higher prevalence of other comorbidities such as diabetes renal impairment arterial hypertension and obesity which altogether increased proportion of hypertensive patients

 the prevalence of overweight and obesity was not reported in available studies about covid19 this circulus vitiosus between hypertension obesity and diabetes is difficult to break and therefore conclusion cannot be made without detailed data of all links of chain the impact of smoking should not be forgotten in the relation between copd hypertension and higher propensity to covid19

 however results are conflicting but majority of authors did not find higher prevalence of smoking in patients with adverse outcome
7

9
 the level of renal damage cannot be excluded as one of contribute factor for higher percentage of hypertension and advance stage of covid19 in hypertensive patients most of studies reported the large prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in covid19 patients but they also did not classified them and therefore it is difficult to estimate the individual effect of coronary artery disease heart failure and atrial fibrillation on occurrence and severity of covid19 li et al summarized the findings from 6 studies and showed that the prevalence of hypertension cardio and cerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with covid19 was 171 164 and 97 respectively
17
 the incidences of hypertension cardiocerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were two to threefolds higher in patients with severe type of covid19 than in their nonsevere counterparts yang et al included 46248 covid19 patients from 8 studies and reported that the most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension diabetes cardiovascular diseases and respiratory system disease
18
 the most frequent comorbidities in severe patients were hypertension respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease the large metaanalysis that included 76993 patients with covid19 found that the pooled prevalence of hypertension cardiovascular disease smoking history and diabetes was 1637 1211 763 and 787 respectively 
19
 table 1 the authors of metaanalyses agreed about the large heterogeneity between studies which obviously limited the quality of their study this can be partly explained by different designs and large variation in sample size among studies
18
 
19

 some essential data are still missing and it would be dangerous to ascribe the large portion of risk for sarscov2 infection or severity of covid19 to any risk factor including hypertension it would be reasonable to hypothesize that uncontrolled comorbidities as well as combination of concomitant diseases may increase the risk of infection and severity of covid19 but this has to be examined there are many controversies about the effect of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors acei and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arb in covid19 patients
24
 some authors expressed their concern that the use of reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas inhibitors and variation in ace2 expression may be partly responsible for sarscov2 virulence
25
 
26
 populationbased studies estimated that only small proportion of hypertensive patients in china 30 to 40 is treated with antihypertensive therapy and raas inhibitors are used in only 25 to 30 of treated patients
27
 
28
 therefore it can be anticipated that only small percentage of covid19 patients in china were actually treated with acei or arb on the other hand the prevalence of cardiac damage in covid19 patients is not negligible and it is associated with adverse outcome in these subjects
5
 
6
 data regarding the frequency of heart failure in covid19 patients are scarce and the same is valid for chronic kidney disease from therapeutic point of view acei and arb have important roles in treatment of these conditionscardiac injury heart failure and renal impairment particularly with albuminuria therefore withdrawing raas inhibitors or switching medications would have uncertain benefits but very certain disadvantages it would be expected that problem with raas inhibitors would escalate in western countries europe and usa where patients are taking antihypertensive medications and particularly raas inhibitors in significantly higher percentage than in china however studies from italy and usa did not show any association between raas inhibitors and susceptibility to coronavirus complications or mortality from covid19
29
 
30
 
31
 even new investigation from china confirmed these findings
32
 the switching from the raas inhibitors to another antihypertensive therapy would lead to insufficient blood pressure control which could induce more complications in covid19 patients than infection of sarscov2 itself novel data showed that raas inhibitors could even improve the outcome of hypertensive patients with covid19
33
 the authors hypothesized that raas inhibitors have an indirect antiviral role by regulating immune function and inhibiting inflammatory responses
31
 based on the available data despite some theoretical possibilities multiple specialty societies recommended that covid19 patients should continue therapy with raas inhibitors
34
 
35
 
36

 limited number of studies provided outcome data after a short followup therefore one should be careful in interpretation of these findings guan et al demonstrated that patients with severe covid19 and those with primary end point admission in intensive care unit the use of mechanical ventilation or death had significantly higher percentage of hypertension diabetes coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease copd chronic renal disease and cancer
3
 the authors did not investigate the relationship between different demographic and clinical parameters with severity of disease or the outcome shi et al reported that hypertension diabetes coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease copd and cancer were more prevalent in the patients with myocardial injury diagnosed by elevation of highsensitivity troponin i and creatinine kinasemyocardial band ckmb
5
 cardiac injury was associated with significantly higher mortality 521 vs 45 the authors did not investigate which comorbidities were associated with cardiac injury and mortality it must be noted that patients with cardiac injury were significantly older guo et al demonstrated similar results when compared covid19 patients with and without elevation of troponin and found that 278 of patients with covid19 had cardiac injury
6
 in this study chronic renal dysfunction and usage of raas were also more prevalent in patients with cardiac injury however patients with cardiac injury were almost 20 years older and more frequently men than those without injury which also have to be taken into account it was also reported that underlying cardiovascular disease was worsening outcome only in patients with myocardial injury
6
 defining myocardial injury only by elevation of troponin i in these circumstances could be questionable because this biomarker may be increased in many conditions such as inflammation andor sepsissystemic inflammatory response syndrome and kidney injury the authors did not clearly stated which disorders were included under the term cardiovascular disease and it is not clear whether hypertension was included in this term furthermore it is difficult to understand which cardiomyopathies were included and whether patients with heart failure were included chen et al reported that hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes were more prevalent among covid19 patients who died in comparison with survivors
7
 however there was a large difference in age and sex distribution between groups and authors did not investigate the effect of comorbidities on outcome in this population
7
 table 2 zhou et al reported that hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease chronic renal disease and copd were more frequent among nonsurvivors than in survivors
9
 the authors found that hypertension diabetes and coronary heart disease were predictors of mortality in covid19 patients nevertheless none of these comorbidities remained significant predictor of mortality after adjustment for age sex and smoking status these findings confirmed the importance of comprehensive risk assessment by including all relevant risk factors and comorbidities in the large original study that included 1590 patients guan et al showed that after adjusting for age and smoking status patients with copd diabetes hypertension and malignancy were more likely to reach the composite end points admission to intensive care unit or invasive ventilation or death than those without
12
 malignancy copd hypertension and diabetes increased the risk of adverse outcome for 35 27 157 and 158fold respectively
12
 patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly higher risk of the composite end point than patients with a single comorbidity stratification of patients according to their age 65 years vs 65 years did not show significant difference in the strength of associations between the number of comorbidities and mortality of covid19
12
 however it cannot be excluded that other confounding factors besides aging and smoking might also be responsible for the association between comorbidities and outcome it would be also helpful to divide primary outcome into two separate outcomes a admission to intensive care unit andor invasive ventilation and b death this would provide separated information about independent predictors of severity and mortality of covid19 this was performed in the small study and authors found that hypertension and diabetes were predictors of acute respiratory distress syndrome but not mortality in covid19 patients
16
 unfortunately multivariable analysis with adjustment for relevant confounding factors was not performed in this investigation there are a number of limitations in the mentioned investigations the selfreporting of comorbidities on hospital admission represents one of them underreporting of comorbidities due to the lack of awareness andor the lack of diagnostic testing could interfere the associations between comorbidities and clinical outcome more importantly the duration of followup was short and some patients remained in the hospital at the time of publishing these studies which means that real outcome was unknown obesity was not reported in available studies and its influence could not be investigated furthermore only one study reported basal values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure which would help to estimate the percentage of uncontrolled hypertension the same refers to prevalence of patients with uncontrolled diabetes the most of studies included small number of patients which is additional obstacle one should not forget the fact that majority of studies come from china and we should be cautious when extrapolating these findings to other countries with outbreak of covid19 studies should consider all potential sources of bias and confounding which is why additional investigations with improved design are warranted recent findings reported that arterial hypertension represented one of the most common comorbidities in patients with covid19 this prevalence ranged between 10 and 34 the impact of hypertension on outcome and particularly on mortality in covid19 patients is not clear due to lack of data studies did not provide evidence that raas inhibitors should be avoided or switched in these patients large studies that will consider all potential sources of bias and confounding factors as well as longer followup are necessary the public pressure to find all answers is very high but physicians duty is to stay rational and has scientific approach to available and upcoming data  title page impact of chronic comorbidities on progression and prognosis in patients with covid-19 a retrospective cohort study in 1031 hospitalized cases in wuhan china hesong zeng tianlu zhang xingwei he yuxin du yan tong xueli wang weizhong zhang yin shen shanghai   the recent outbreak of covid-19 has rapidly spread worldwide a large proportion of covid-19 patients with chronic underlying complications have been reported to be in severe condition and show unpromising clinical outcomes but whether chronic comorbidities are risk factors affecting the severity of covid-19 has not been well described  1031 covid-19 inpatients were included in this study of whom 866 were discharged and 165 were dead in hospital 73 of 165 dead patients had complicated chronic comorbidities of the 1031 patients 514 50 were combined with chronic comorbidities and showed cfr 28 times as that of patients without any underlying disease the number of patients with hypertension accounted for three fourths of those with concomitant underlying diseases the univariable regression revealed that patients in the simple hypertension group showed overall risk higher than those in the simple diabetes mellitus group in the age-grouped research patients in the hypertension senile group were proved to be at the highest risk which might be associated with the level of ldh and egfr in this retrospective cohort study 166 43 patients with hypertension took ccb during the hospitalization the odds ratio of cfr in patients with hypertension taking ccb group was 068 p  0155 compared to those not our data shows that the clinical manifestations of most hospitalized patients with covid-19 are actually systemic syndromes although covid-19 is defined as novel coronavirus pneumonia in china hypertension is not just a chronic underlying comorbidity but also a risk factor affecting the severity of covid-19 and does play a critical role in worsening patients clinical outcomes therefore hypertension management in patients with covid-19 should be regarded as a major challenge in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies including optimal management of blood pressure and pathophysiological status the recent outbreak of covid-19 has rapidly spread worldwide a large proportion of covid-19 patients with chronic underlying complications have been reported to be in severe condition and show unpromising clinical outcomes but whether chronic comorbidities are risk factors affecting the severity of covid-19 has not been well described we included covid-19

although covid-19 is defined as novel coronavirus pneumonia in china hypertension is not just a chronic underlying comorbidity but also a risk factor affecting the severity of covid-19 and does play a critical role in improving patients clinical outcomes therefore hypertension management in patients with covid-19 should be a major challenge in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies including optimal management of blood pressure and pathophysiological status the infection of covid-19 has swiftly spread worldwide the clinical spectrum of covid-19 patients appears to be wide ranging from asymptomatic infection to mild and to critical illness 1 2  a significant portion of covid-19 patients were reported to have at least one underlying complication when admitted to hospital with hypertension diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular diseases being the most common 3  there were about 20 of covid-19 patients abruptly progressing from mild or normal condition to severe or critical illness while the critical determinants remain to be identified for early detection early prediction and early treatment identifying the factors and biological indicators in particular those of early warning value for the development of disease progression and prognosis are critical for clinical decision making and medical resource allocation in this article we conducted an in-depth

asymptomatic infection to mild and to critical illness requiring ventilators and even ecmo to sustain lives 1 2  wuhan scholars in china first reported that about half of the patients with severe infection were complicated with chronic comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease 7  among those infected with underlying diseases about 38 progressed to severe cases 7  about 60 of severe cases with chronic comorbidities died in hospital 7  however whether chronic comorbidities can be regarded as a risk factor affecting the severity of covid-19 remains controversial at that time recently there were many reports that age and concomitant diseases might aggravate the disease progression and affect clinical outcomes among covid-19 patients covid-19 patients with pre-existing complications were observed to show higher cfr-105 73 63 60 56 for patients with cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus chronic respiratory disease hypertension and cancer respectively 6  it has been reported that the greater the number of underlying diseases is combined the greater the severity of covid-19 3  the retrospective analyses of covid-19 patients in zhejiang province and in 31 province across mainland china revealed that underlying hypertension was an independent risk factor for severe cases even after adjustment for age 3 8  among 1043 covid-19 patients admitted to icu with available data in italy 49 had underlying hypertension after excluding patients still in icu as of the deadline of the study the cfr  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made

and without hypertension was 70 and 47 9  the result of the population-based cohort study in england supported that patients with hypertension should be included in the high-risk group 10  in our retrospective study it was found that the determinants of the severity of covid-19 were closely related to the age and chronic comorbidities chronic comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus are major risk factors affecting disease progression and prognosis patients with simple hypertension may be at higher risk than those with simple diabetes mellitus and senile hypertensive patients are at highest risk for progression and its prognosis of covid-19 why do chronic comorbidities such as hypertension increase the risk of the disease progression and its prognosis it was very important and should be investigated now an article named viral and host factors related to the clinical outcome of covid-19 was published online 11  to analyze viral genome variation from sample collection of 326 patients in shanghai public health center no significant variation of viral sequences was observed in severe cases of covid-19 therefore ruling out the possibility of mutation of sars-cov2 itself multiple major laboratory indicators were compared among discharged and dead patients with and without hypertension there was no significant difference observed in general there was also no significant difference found in sbp and map among these four groups the results suggest that it is likely due to the pathophysiological status and target organ damage in patients with hypertension such as ras system and the laboratory indicator of egfr rather than the blood pressure itself that makes hypertension as a risk factor of illness development and prognosis it is now known that the infection of sars-cov2 needs its combination with ace2 and tmprss2 of human alveolar epithelial cells type 2 or other tissues and subsequent replication and multiplication the amount of virus leads to increased expression of ace2 in neighboring cells and then affects macrophages with inflammatory cytokines released 12  consequently the increased expression and activity of ace2 in tissue could be identified as the critical factor of patients susceptibility and disease progression the huanggang study published online conducted serological tests of ace2 in 20 covid-19 patients and 20 non-covid-19 patients revealing that the serum level of ace2 increased 12 hours after infection and remained high 48 hours after infection 13  the expression of ace2 is only mildly expressed in lung tissue of healthy human however brazilian researchers recently found that the expression of ace2 in lung tissue was up-regulated in covid-19 patients with underlying diseases 14  including hypertension which might provide a reasonable explanation for the increased severity in some covid-19 patients with underlying complications to our knowledge this study is a retrospective report mainly focusing on patients with hypertension which accounts for the highest proportion of covid-19 patients at risk because early targeted interventions will prevent the disease from further progressing so that reasonable management strategy of hypertension should be necessary and might help to improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized covid-19 patients at high risk our retrospective cohort study has some limitations firstly only admission examination for the indicator of egfr was captured in the collected data and the overall level of aki might therefore be underestimated secondly the information of patients prior to admission was not put into the medical history so it could not be determined whether the patients continued to take or changed the medication during hospitalization thirdly there was no national unified standard for the normal reference values of some laboratory indicators thus we followed the standards set by the hospital finally the data entry of underlying diseases was based on the inquiries of patients enrolled in the hospital and might be underestimated due to the influence of awareness rate the retrospective cohort study revealed that of the 1031 covid-19 inpatients 50 were combined with chronic comorbidities and showed cfr 28 times as that of patients without any underlying disease 73 of 165 dead patients were complicated with chronic comorbidities and the number of patients with hypertension accounted for three fourths of those with concomitant underlying diseases the odds ratio of occurrence of composite endpoint for covid-19 inpatients with simple hypertension was 153 p0019 indicating that the overall risk was higher in the simple hypertension group than the simple diabetes mellitus group according to the age-grouped research we found that the hypertension senile group was at the highest risk it suggests that hypertension management in patients with covid-19 would be a major challenge in the therapeutic strategies including optimal management of blood pressure and pathophysiological status so that it might help to improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized covid-19 patients at high risk

multi-center clinical data will be needed to support our conclusions  in december 2019 a cluster of severe cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause emerged in wuhan china with clinical presentations greatly resembling viral pneumonia 1 deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus which was named coronavirus disease  by mar 16 2020 hypertension rates range from 134 in non-severe patients to 234 in severe patients and the total incidence is as high as 15 2  interestingly angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is involved in the pathogenesis of both hypertension and covid-19 pneumonia the above reasons prompted us to speculate that the organs attacked by sars-cov-2 might not only be the lungs but may also include other ace2 expression organs especially the cardiovascular system in addition patients with comorbid hypertension especially those with long-term oral aceiarb medication for hypertension might have different susceptibility and severity levels of pneumonia upon infection with sars-cov-2 therefore we investigated and compared the demographic characteristics coexisting diseases severity of pneumonia and the effect of antihypertensive drugs aceiarb versus non-aceiarb in covid-19 patients with coexisting hypertension our findings may hopefully reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with hypertension in

aceiarb drugs to reduce the risk of severe pneumonia mechanistically the increase in the zinc metallopeptidase ace2 might help sars-cov-2 enter the cells and accelerate its replication ace2 is the only known human homologue of the key regulator of blood pressure angiotensin-converting enzyme ace since its discovery in 2000 ace2 has been implicated to play an important role in the preservation of heart function and the balance of blood pressure with its effects being mediated in part through its ability to convert angiotensin ii ang ii to angiotensin-1-7 unexpectedly ace2 also serves as the cellular entry point for the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus and the enzyme is therefore a prime target for pharmacological intervention on coronavirus-related diseases 9  in 2003 ace2 was identified as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov which mediates the infection and transmission of sars-cov this effect does not rely on the protease activity on ace 10  structural analysis showed that the spinous protein of sars-cov was in contact with the head-end of the ace2 catalytic domain subunit i did not involve subunit ii and did not block the active region once sars-cov is connected to ace2 the extracellular part of ace2 will be lysed and the transmembrane part will be transferred into the cell which mediates further fusion of the virus particles and host cells 11  through next-generation sequencing technology the entire genome sequence of covid-19 has been successfully determined 12  compared with the genomic sequences of previous coronaviruses it is found that sars-cov-2 has 79 similarity with sars-cov 13  it is worth noting that aceiarb drugs that are administered to hypertensive patients have resulted in an increased expression of ace2 in the lungs the role of ace2 is opposite  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in

produce angiotensin 1-7 peptides thereby generating vasodilation and lowering blood pressure aceiarb drugs may increase the protein concentration of ace2 in rat plasma mrna level of ace2 and even the activity of ace2 in cardiac tissue 14  thus it is possible that those hypertensive patients who had been taking aceiarb might have an increased level of mrna and protein expression of ace2 in the lungs making them more vulnerable for sars-cov-2 entry as well as for development of severe covid-19 pneumonia these findings are worth investigating further however some scholars believe that the down-regulation of ace2 expression after a neo coronavirus challenge aggravates lung injuries this opinion mainly comes from animal model studies in multiple laboratories and a small sample clinical study studies have shown that ace2 expression decreases after viral infection causing acute lung injury exogenous supplementation with ace2 could alleviate acute lung injury 15  human recombinant ace 2 rhuace2 and angiotensin ii type 2 receptors protect mice from severe acute lung injuries induced by acid aspiration or sepsis 16  it was found that patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards who were treated with rhuace2 injections had rapidly decreasing levels of ang ii and increasing levels of ang1-7 17  the down-regulation of ace2 caused the imbalance of aceang ii and ace2 and the activity of ang ii in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas was enhanced because of the lack of antagonism 17  ang ii mediates increased pulmonary vascular permeability by binding to receptor at1 and might also cause pulmonary vascular contraction resulting in hydrostatic pressure elevation and pulmonary edema 10 17  more clinical evidence is required to determine whether the expression of

to reduce the possibility of developing severe pneumonia our investigation found that covid-19 patients taking aceiarb agents are younger than patients taking non-aceiarb agents this may be related to their doctors prescribing habits however we cannot directly conclude that covid-19 patients taking aceiarb antihypertensive drugs will have more severe pneumonia than those not taking aceiarb drugs because many confounding factors such as coexisting diseases have not yet been excluded our survey shows that the population with hypertension does not seem to be more susceptible to covid-19

followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease 11  several studies have demonstrated higher prevalence of diabetes in covid-19 patients however the effect of the prevalence of diabetes on severity of the disease needs further exploration the understanding of the association might be helpful in early vigilant monitoring and better management of covid-19 patients at high risk leading to ards organ failure and death thus in this meta-analysis we aim to assess the association of diabetes and hypertension with severity of disease this systematic literature review followed the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis prisma guidelines extension for scoping reviews 12  we searched pubmed medline and cochrane until march 31 2020 using the keywords covid-19 and diabetes

coronavirus and hypertension two studies were found from other sources after removing duplicates 53 articles were found to be potential publications for screening after the application of predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria a total of seven studies were included for the meta-analysis all the included studies were conducted in china the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension were reported in survivors and non-survivors in two studies icu care and non-icu care patients in two studies while the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in severe and non-severe patients was reported in three studies among the seven included studies three were cohort studies 11 14 16  while four were case-series 1 7 10 17  the studies enrolled a total of 2018 patients including 1175 males and 840 females the demographic characteristics of the subjects included in these studies are provided in table 1   we assessed the quality of data in the included studies using the nih quality assessment tools the quality assessment indicated that most included studies were of acceptable quality all the papers clearly stated the research question or objective the study population was clearly specified and defined and all the subjects were selected from the same or similar populations the detailed result of the quality assessment is provided in supplementary file 00 figure 2c   recent evidence on sars-cov-2 suggest that the presence of comorbidities increase mortality risk in covid-19 patients diabetes is one the most important components to predict adverse outcomes 18  thus the present meta-analysis was conducted to assess the association of diabetes with disease severity in covid-19 patients the present meta-analysis was based on data from 7 studies on covid-19 patients the present meta-analysis demonstrated that the prevalence of diabetes is lower in survivors than in non-survivors of covid-19 patients however there was no difference in diabetes prevalence in patients requiring or not requiring icu care additionally a positive association between diabetes and disease severity was found several studies have demonstrated higher prevalence of diabetes in covid-19 patients however the effect of the prevalence of diabetes on severity of the disease needs further exploration a recent meta-analysis on the comorbidities suggested diabetes as one of the most prevalent comorbidities 86 95 ci 6-11 in covid-19 patients however no significant difference was found in diabetes between severe and non-severe group 19  another similar meta-analysis demonstrated the pooled prevalence of diabetes to be 787 95ci 657-928 20  a meta-analysis reported the proportions of diabetes in patients with covid-19 to be 97 the incidences of diabetes were about two folds higher in icusevere cases than in their non-icusevere counterparts 18  a retrospective study showed that 8554 of severe patients had diabetes or cardiovascular diseases which was significantly higher than that of the mild group 21  a case-series reported 58 covid-19 patients to have comorbid diabetes mellitus 22  although the pathophysiology involved in this comorbidity remains unexplained several hypotheses have been suggested blood glucose level is suggested to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases the immune system of diabetes patients might be altered by the abnormal blood glucose level resulting in dysregulation and reduced responses of immune components consequently these patients are susceptible to sars-cov-2 and various other types of bacteria 21  another hypothesis states that human pathogenic coronaviruses sars-cov and sarscov-2 bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung intestine kidney and blood vessels the expression of ace2 is significantly increased in diabetes patients being treated with ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii type-i receptor blockers use of thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen can also be increased ace2 consequently the increased expression of ace2 would facilitate infection with covid-19 23  the present meta-analysis showed that hypertension is lower in survivors than in non-survivors of covid-19 patients additionally a positive association of hypertension with disease severity and icu care was found a recent meta-analysis demonstrated hypertension to be the most prevalent comorbidity 177 95 ci 14-22 in covid-19 patients additionally higher risk with hypertension was found in the severe group compared to those in non-severe group or 236 95 ci 146-383 19  according to another meta-analysis the pooled prevalence of hypertension in people infected with sars-cov-2 were estimated as 1637 95ci 1015-2365 20  a meta-analysis reported the proportions of hypertension in patients with covid-19 to be 171 the incidence of hypertension were about two folds higher in icusevere cases than in their non-icusevere counterparts 18  in understanding of the disease to establish risk stratification of the patients all authors contributed significantly to this manuscript funding this research did not receive any

observational study songjiang huang jianwen wang fen liu jiacheng liu guijuan cao chongtu yang wei liu chao tu muxin zhu bin xiong   at the end of 2019 a series of unexplained pneumonia cases appeared and showed a tendency for transmission from person to person soon scientists isolated the causative pathogen a new type of  coronavirus 1 which was subsequently named by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 2 the disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization 3 as of april 19 2020 the cumulative number of confirmed cases worldwide was 2242395 and the cumulative death toll was 152551 4 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is considered to be the receptor for sars-cov-2 to enter human cells 5 ace2 is widely expressed in various organ systems of the human body including the respiratory system and the cardiovascular system 6 the enzyme can catalyze the conversion of angiotensin ii ang ii to angiotensin 17 which is a peptide that counteracts the proinflammatory prooxidation and vasoconstrictive effects of ang ii studies have shown that hypertension may be one of the most common comorbid diseases in patients with covid-19 7 a study involving 1099 covid-19 patients had a prevalence of hypertension of 234 in severe patients 8 because of the interaction between sars-cov-2 and ace2 and the role of ace2 in the pathogenesis of hypertension there are many speculations that hypertension may be involved in the pathogenesis of covid-19 however some early reports have not revealed whether there is a relationship between hypertension and disease severity therefore it remains unclear whether high blood pressure is a risk factor for covid-19 or whether blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with covid-19 is a low-risk factor to understand whether hypertension is a risk factor affecting the progress and prognosis of covid-19 this study included 310 cases of covid-19 patients admitted to wuhan jinyintan hospital and the central hospital of wuhan after the outbreak in 2020 their demographic data clinical manifestations laboratory indicators and treatment methods were collected and analyzed in this study we collected the clinical data of 310 patients diagnosed with covid-19 at wuhan jinyintan hospital and the central hospital of wuhan after the outbreak in 2020 according to the world health organizations temporary guidelines all the patients enrolled in this study were diagnosed with covid-19 in the first part of the study all patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had high blood pressure to avoid the effects of other complications the second part of the study excluded patients with complications other than hypertension and then divided the remaining patients into a hypertension group and a nonhypertension group we monitored all patients in our study and recorded the entire course of the disease and the final clinical outcome of each person the demographic data epidemiological characteristics clinical features severity of the disease laboratory tests and treatment results of the patients were obtained from the medical record system and recorded the date of onset was defined as the date of the first onset of symptoms all patients with covid-19 met the following criteria 1 epidemic history 2 fever or other respiratory symptoms 3 abnormal ct imaging of typical viral pneumonia and 4 positive sars-cov-2 rna by rt-pcr according to their medical history the patients were divided into a hypertension group and a nonhypertension group the clinical classification of patients was based mainly on the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan trial version 7 developed by the national health committee of the peoples republic of china 9 classifications could be summarized as follows 1 mild type only mild clinical symptoms with no sign of pneumonia in imaging features 2 common type complicated with fever respiratory symptoms and imaging features of pneumonia 3 severe type complicated with any of the following a respiratory distress respiratory rate  30 beatsmin b mean oxygen saturation  93 at rest or c ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen pao2fio2  300 mmhg 1 mmhg  0133 kpa and 4 critical type complicated with any of the following a respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation required b shock or c organ dysfunction and intensive care unit admission required in our research we combined both the severe type and critical type patients into the severe group using spss250 software ibm inc chicago il usa the categorical variables are expressed as frequencies percentages and the continuous variables are expressed as the mean  standard deviation or the median of the quartile interval whenever appropriate students t test or mannwhitney u test was used for continuous variables and chi-square test or fisher exact test was used for categorical variables a multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for age and sex was used in a multivariate analysis a p value  005 was considered statistically significant of the 310 patients with covid-19 the median age was 62 years interquartile range 4970 the number of women was 136 439 and the number of men was 174 561 the most common symptom of all patients was fever which was observed in 819 of the patients the frequencies of other symptoms were cough 632 dyspnea 523 expectoration 194 muscle ache 77 and diarrhea 129 whereas headache occurred in 3 cases 10 the most common complications were hypertension 365 and diabetes 155 followed by cerebrovascular diseases 68 and cardiovascular diseases 61 the number of deaths in the hospital was 58 187 a total of 155 patients 50 were in the severe group including severe type and critically ill type according to our definition compared with nonhypertensive patients hypertensive patients were older 67

also shows that patients with hypertension had significantly higher neutrophil counts 791 iqr 341798 vs 258 iqr 190692 neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio nlr 998 iqr 3611760 vs 496 iqr 1921099 alanine

partial prothrombin time aptt 234 iqr 206305 vs 293 iqr 237331 in hypertensive patients was significantly lower than that in nonhypertensive patients these data suggested that covid-19 patients with hypertension tended to show more severe inflammation and organ damage than covid-19 patients without hypertension which may lead to a poor prognosis to better explore the impact of hypertension on the progression and prognosis of covid-19 and avoid the confounding effects of other complications in the following analysis we excluded patients with complications other than hypertension and the results are shown in tables 3 and 4 compared with nonhypertensive patients hypertensive patients were older 66 iqr 5671 vs 54 iqr 3867 had a higher proportion of severe cases 646 vs 381 and had a higher proportion of icu admission 215 vs 113 however in terms of mortality and the length of hospital stay there were no significant differences between the two groups of patients in addition with regard to

nonhypertensive patients in a multivariate analysis table 5 we separately used the severity or mortality of covid-19 as dependent variables and age sex and hypertension as candidate independent variables to establish a multivariable logistic regression model the results showed that the odds ratios of hypertension were 1562 95 ci 09292625 p  0092 and 1262 95 ci 06832332 p  0458 in the analysis of severity and mortality respectively finally we discussed the effects of other complications on the prognosis of hypertensive covid-19 patients we found that most of the laboratory indexes of hypertensive covid-19 patients with other complications were not significantly different from those of hypertensive patients without other complications table 6 which suggested that the effect of other complications on the prognosis of hypertensive covid-19 patients may be limited in our study the median age of covid-19 patients was 62 years and the prevalence rate of hypertension was 365 a national survey conducted in china from october 2012 to december 2015 showed that the total prevalence of hypertension in chinas adult population 18 years old is 232 10 in addition a previous multicenter study showed that 30 of covid-19 patients with a median age of 56 had previously coexisting hypertension 2 another large sample of 1099 covid-19 cases with a median age of 47 had a prevalence of hypertension of 15 8 the higher prevalence of hypertension in our study may be explained by a higher median age in general there is not sufficient evidence to show that people with high blood pressure are more likely to be infected with covid-19 than those without hypertension our study revealed that hypertensive covid-19 patients tend to show higher mortality previous clinical studies on sars and middle east respiratory syndrome showed that hypertension is a risk factor for increased mortality in infected patients 11 12 the specific pathogenesis of hypertension that may lead to more severe covid-19 remains to be studied the imbalance of cytokines may be considered an explanation for the correlation between hypertension and severe covid-19 increasing clinical data have shown a relationship between the deterioration of covid-19 and cytokine storms 7 such as elevated levels of il-6 interleukin-7 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and tumor necrosis factor  it is worth noting that previous clinical studies have found that the increase in these cytokines is also associated with the development of hypertension 13 a notable example is that il-6 has been observed to be closely related to the poor prognosis of patients with covid-19 14 which is also one of the important cytokines regulating immune-inflammatory responses in hypertension in addition in hypertensive patients with covid-19 due to the imbalance in the renin-angiotensin system ras the nadhnadph oxidase system may be activated by excessive inflammatory reactions or a large number of cytokines 15 resulting in cell damage and vasoconstriction 16 aggravating lung damage in covid-19 and leading to a poor prognosis the pathophysiology and inflammatory disorders of hypertension may partly explain poor prognoses for covid-19 in addition the effect of antihypertensive drugs on covid-19 in patients with hypertension is controversial on the one hand the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceis can result in a decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme ace and an increase in the expression of ace2 in the lungs 17 more ace2 may mediate the invasion and infection of sars-cov-2 into lung cells resulting in viral spread and aggravation of symptoms on the other hand as a negative regulator of the ras system ace2 can catalyze the hydrolysis of ang ii to ang17 and ang17 binds to the mas receptor and plays an important role in antialveolar epithelial apoptosis lowering blood pressure and protecting the endothelium 18 by reducing the effect of ang ii and increasing the production of ang17 ace2 can induce vasodilation and an antiinflammatory response 19 which helps to reduce the degree of lung injury and prevent the emergence of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and acute lung injury a study from china involving 1128 hypertensive covid-19 patients showed that hypertensive patients who used aceis or angiotension receptor blocker arbs in hospitals had a lower risk of all-cause death than those who did not use aceisarbs 20 in addition an article from the covid-19 working group of the european society of hypertension pointed out that there is no evidence to support that ras inhibitors are harmful to covid-19 patients so there is no reason for hypertensive patients with stable conditions to stop using ras inhibitors 21 our multivariate analysis showed that after adjusting for age and sex hypertension did not show a significant correlation with increased covid-19 disease severity or mortality which was contrary to the results of a previous large-sample study 20 we speculate that the possible reasons are that the sample size of our data is small the number of end events is small and the test efficiency is insufficient at the same time the regression models used by both studies are different and the adjusted variables are also different at present there is a lack of research on hypertensive covid-19 patients especially those adjusted for age and sex and our study can be regarded as a reference overall our comparative analysis of covid-19 patients with and without hypertension showed that hypertensive patients had greater disease severity and adverse progression than nonhypertensive patients however this result may be related to the higher age in this group than in nonhypertension group in addition there were more severe symptoms greater likelihood of other complications such as diabetes more likelihood of transfer to the icu and worse laboratory indicators covid-19 patients with hypertension need additional attention to prevent adverse outcomes our study has the following limitations first the number of patients included in our survey is not enough and the effectiveness of the testing may not be sufficient in future studies we need a larger sample size of clinical data to support our conclusions second we did not analyze complications such as acute renal injury and ards because we focused on analyzing the risks associated with hypertension in addition due to the retrospective nature of this study as well as the urgency of time and difficulties in collection there was a lack of the use of antihypertensive drugs in patients third because the diagnosis of hypertension was extracted from medical history data there may be a very small number of patients with hypertension which may not have been accurately recorded however these limitations will not affect the reliability of our overall results  association of hypertension with the severity and fatality of sars-cov-2 infection a meta-analysis jingqi zhang jing wu xiaohua sun hong xue jianguo shao weihua cai yang jing ming yue chen dong   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 a newly emerging acute respiratory disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets 1 compared with sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 is well capable of sustained community transmission with each case estimated to infect another 23 uninfected persons on average 2 as of 3 april 2020 approximate one million covid-19 cases and 40 000 deaths have been reported in more than 200 countriesregions around the world 3 therefore it is urgently needed to identify the risk factors associated with the severity and fatality of sars-cov-2 infection recently several clinical studies have noticed that hypertension was one of the most common comorbidities in patients with sars-cov-2 infection 46 for example in one cohort of 191 patients from wuhan china zhou et al reported that about half of the patients had different comorbidities with hypertension being the most common 30 7 in a cohort of 138 hospitalised patients with covid-19 wang et al observed that hypertension 312 diabetes 101 cardiovascular disease 145 and malignancy 172 were the most common coexisting medical conditions 8 in addition an analysis of an outpatient and inpatient cohort of 1099 patients with covid-19 showed that 15 of the patients had a history of hypertension 9 however published articles with different study designs and populations usually yield different estimates and effect sizes therefore a comprehensive and systematic analysis is necessary because of this variability as one of the most important public health problems in the 21st century hypertension affects more than one billion individuals worldwide 10 however the influence of hypertension on sars-cov-2 infection remains unclear therefore we conducted the present meta-analysis to evaluate the associations of hypertension with the severity and fatality of sars-cov-2 infection this assessment might be helpful to further understand the characteristics of sars-cov-2 infection in hypertensive patients this meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma statement 11 articles published up to 20 march 2020 in pubmed elsevier science direct web of science wiley online library and cnki were considered for this review we searched the medical subject heading mesh terms of 2019-ncov ncip covid-19 or sars-cov-2 and hypertension additionally we performed manual searches on the references of selected articles to avoid omission to be included in this meta-analysis the study had to 1 covid-19 cases diagnosed according to the new coronavirus infected pneumonia diagnosis and treatment program 5th version 12 all of the included covid-19 cases should be laboratory confirmed hospitalised patients on the basis of positive qrt-pcr results for sars-cov-2 in swab samples 2 clinical features definite disease severity or fatality according to the new coronavirus infected pneumonia diagnosis and treatment program 5th version 12 3 parameters clear information about hypertension 4 study population at least included 10 cases case reports reviews meta-analysis articles letters comments editorials expert opinions studies without adequate information and the articles published in languages other than english and chinese were excluded the detail retrieval process was shown in figure 1
 the types of covid-19 severity was determined according to the new coronavirus infected pneumonia diagnosis and treatment program 5th version 12 briefly the criteria for disease severity determination were as follows 1 mild cases the clinical symptoms were mild and there was no sign of pneumonia on imaging 2 moderate cases only showing fever and respiratory symptoms with radiological findings of pneumonia 3 severe cases for adults respiratory distress 30 breathsmin  oxygen saturation 93 at rest  arterial partial pressure of oxygen pao2fraction of inspired oxygen fio2 300 mmhg 4 critical cases  respiratory failure and requiring mechanical ventilation  shock  with other organ failure that requires icu care in this study hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmhg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmhg or use of antihypertensive medications or a self-reported history of hypertension 13 titles abstracts and full texts were screened independently by two reviewers in the first step jingqi zhang and jing wu discrepancies in data interpretation were resolved by discussion with a third author chen dong when necessary data extracted from the selected studies included the first authors name publication date average age type of study design and severity of covid-19 in hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients all reviewers performed a quality control check between the final data used in the meta-analysis and the original publications to prevent extraction errors the quality of each included article was assessed using the newcastle-ottawa scale nos based on the following dimensions 14 covid-19 cases selection comparability and outcomes of disease severity or fatality the cases selection contained four items 1 the representativeness of the cases 2 the appropriate determination of severe cases 3 the appropriate determination of non-severe cases 4 the appropriate determination of hypertension comparability contained one item which was to consider the comparability between patients with and without hypertension when designing and statistical analysis the lowest quality of the literature was 0 and the highest quality was 9 stars assessment scores of 03 points 46 points and 79 points were considered as poor fair and good studies respectively simultaneously the quality of each included study was further evaluated using strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology strobe 2007 version checklist in this study in this study the mildmoderate and severecritical covid-19 cases were classified into non-severe and severe groups respectively forest plots were used to illustrate the severity and fatality of sars-cov-2 infection in hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients which were described by pooled odds ratio pooled or 95 confidence intervals ci the magnitude of heterogeneity between-study was tested using i2 statistics i2 values of 25 50 and 75 represented low moderate and high degrees of heterogeneity respectively if there was no evidence of between-studies heterogeneity i2  50 a fixed-effects model was used to calculate the combined or otherwise a random-effects model was selected 15 sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding studies successively furthermore subgroup analysis was performed according to age 50 or 50 years in this study the possibility of publication bias was evaluated by using the visual inspection of a funnel plot and eggers test a p value of eggers test 010 was considered as an indication of potential publication bias all analysis was performed using the package of meta in r software version 363 and significance was defined as p  005 with the use of a two-sided test unless otherwise specified a total of 929 articles were obtained by the electronic and manual search of these duplicated articles were excluded at the first stage n  314 then 175 studies were removed after screening titles and abstracts in addition 17 studies were excluded after thoroughly reviewing the full texts due to the following reasons studies without available data n  6 patients were not classified into severe severecritical and non-severe mildmoderate groups n  6 and case reports or other study design n  5 finally 18 studies recorded with 4505 patients were included in this analysis figure 1 summarised the flow diagram of the studies selection as the results shown in table s1 all included patients were from china including hubei 7 8 1623 jiangxi 24 beijing 25 henan 26 chongqing 27 28 anhui 29 and china cdc 5 9 among of them 12 studies analysed the severity of covid-19 in hypertensive patients 8 9 1620 2428 significant associations between hypertension and covid-19 severity were reported in five studies 8 9 18 19 24 additionally among studies analysed the fatality of sars-cov-2 infection in hypertensive patients 5 7 2123 29 three studies reported that hypertensive patients carried higher risk of covid-19 fatality 5 7 22 all included studies were retrospective studies as the results shown in table s1 the methodological qualities of the included studies were similar nine studies had a moderate risk of participant comparability and confounding variables 8 9 1619 22 23 25 six seven and five studies had 6 7 and 8 points of assessment score in this analysis respectively in addition no significant difference was observed between the results obtained from nos and strobe analysis table s2 twelve studies with 2389 covid-19 patients 674 severe cases were included for the disease severity analysis as shown in table 1 and figure 2a the severity rate of sars-cov-2 infection in hypertensive patients was much higher than in non-hypertensive cases 3758 vs 1973 pooled or 227 95 ci 180286 there was no considerable heterogeneity observed between study i2  8 p-heterogeneity  036 when the individual study was excluded from the analysis one-at-a-time the pooled ors ranged from 211 95 ci 166269 when the study by wang dw et al 8 was excluded to 253 95 ci 194331 when the study by cheng kb et al 18 was excluded fig 2b there was neither evidence of publication bias with eggers test p  013 nor asymmetry indicated by the funnel plot fig s1a

 as severity of illness was significantly correlated to age in covid-19 cases we performed a subgroup analysis to evaluate the effects of hypertension on the covid-19 severity in different age groups as the results shown the pooled ors of covid-19 severity for hypertensive patients vs non-hypertensive cases was 221 95 ci 158310 and 232 95 ci 170317 in age 50 years and 50 years patients respectively fig 3 no considerable heterogeneity was detected between studies within each group
 six studies with 151 deaths among 2116 covid-19 patients were included in this meta-analysis as shown in table 2 and figure 4a the fatality rate of sars-cov-2 infection in hypertensive patients was 1772 which was much higher than in non-hypertensive cases 422 pooled analysis showed that hypertensive patients carried a nearly 348-fold higher risk of dying from covid-19 95 ci 172708 with a moderate heterogeneity between-study i2  56 p-heterogeneity  004 sensitivity analysis showed that the exclusion of any single study one-at-a-time did not alter the direction or statistical difference fig 4b similarly eggers test did not suggest the existence of potential publication bias p  067 fig s1b

 similarly stratified analysis results further suggested the pooled ors of covid-19 mortality for hypertensive patients vs non-hypertensive cases were 643 95 ci 3401217 and 266 95 ci 127557 in age 50 years and 50 years patients respectively fig 5 no significant heterogeneity was presented between studies within each subgroup
 in this study we reported that the overall rates of severity and fatality were 2821 and 714 in the covid-19 patients from the included literatures respectively moreover hypertensive patients with sars-cov-2 infection were shown to have 227- and 348-fold higher risks of severity and fatality compared to the covid-19 cases without hypertension respectively sensitivity analysis with exclusion of studies one by one did not change the results materially suggesting that each included study might not have a particularly strong influence on the results indeed the chronic conditions influencing the severity of sars-cov-2 such as hypertension diabetes and obesity have also been addressed in other respiratory illnesses such as mers influenza and etc for example alqahtani et al reported that hypertension and diabetes mellitus were prevalent in about 50 of cases of mers moreover hypertension showed significant association with fatality from mers-cov infection or 37 95 ci 20269 30 in addition compared to subjects without hypertension severe pandemic influenza occurred significantly more often in those who had hypertension or 149 95 ci 110201 31 currently the exact mechanism of hypertension involvement in severe covid-19 remains unclear one potential explanation is the direct injury mediated via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 similar to sars-cov a chinese study recently indicated that sars-cov-2 infection was caused by binding of the viral surface spike protein to ace2 receptor following activation of the spike protein 32 ace2 is a monocarboxy peptidase best known for cleaving several peptides within the reninangiotensin system 33 since its discovery in 2000 ace2 has been considered as a protective factor against increases in blood pressure therefore it is rational to hypothesise that the binding of sars-cov-2 to ace2 can reduce the physiological function of ace2 and then lead to acute adverse outcomes of hypertension such as multi-organ dysfunction 34 besides severale studies have indicated that ace2 played a critical role in acute lung disease especially acute respiratory distress syndrome 3537 in addition to the heart and lung ace2 could be expressed in the intestinal epithelium vascular endothelium brain liver and kidneys 38 providing a potential mechanism for the severity symptoms and multi-organ dysfunction that can be seen with severe sars-cov-2 infection the epidemiological data of sars-cov-2 infection suggested that severe covid-19 cases were more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension 5 7 9 indicating that age was an important risk factor of severity and fatality of covid-19 for example the china cdc recently reported that patients aged 80 years had the highest case fatality rate 148 among different age groups 39 herein we observed that hypertension was significantly associated with the severity and fatality in sars-cov-2 infection in both age 50 years and 50 years groups suggesting that hypertension could independently increase the risk of disease severity and predict poor outcomes of sars-cov-2 infection although our present results implied that patients aged 50 years had more fatalities of covid-19 compared to those patients 50 years we could not conclude that younger patients are more likely to die of hypertension than older patients because of the paucity of related data indeed further subgroup analysis did not show a significant difference in covid-19 fatality between patients with and without hypertension in the group consisted of studies with small sample size references 21 23 and 29 pooled or 282 95 ci 0203915 fig s3 however these results should be carefully interpreted because of the wide confidence interval therefore more studies are needed to characterize the impacts of hypertension on the covid-19 severity and fatality in future our study has several limitations firstly publication bias is inevitable in any meta-analysis and some relevant articles might be missed as we only included english- and chinese-written studies secondly we could not address the potential impact of anti-hypertension medicines although most hypertensive cases might be treated thus it would underestimate the true difference in severity and fatality of sars-cov-2 infection between patients with and without hypertension thirdly the estimate found in this study was derived from hospitalised cases this might introduce a bias in disease severity and fatality in addition the overlap of cases could not be completely avoided because the patients in references 5 and 9 were collected from the china cdc which did not provide the exact hospital information for this reason the pooled estimate would never represent the actual pooled outcome data however remove references 5 and 9 from our analysis which had the largest sample size did not alter the direction or statistical difference of the present results fourthly the sample size included in this meta-analysis was relatively small thus it would introduce bias in the results last due to most of the included studies were retrospective studies there may be a bias regarding collecting medical information in a retrospective manner therefore caution should be considered to interpret findings in summary the current results provided further evidence that hypertension could significantly increase the risks of severity and fatality of sars-cov-2 infection therefore it is necessary to establish awareness programmes implement effective preventive policies to improve the outcomes of sars-cov-2 infection in persons with hypertension which should be helpful for the reduction in the global burden of the disease  understanding the current status of patients with pulmonary hypertension during covid-19 outbreak a small-scale national survey from china hongmei zhou gangcheng zhang xiaoxian deng bowen jin qiu qiu menghuan yan xi wang xuan zheng   pulmonary hypertension ph is a chronic and progressive lung disease caused by multiple differing etiologies increasing pulmonary vascular resistance led to overloading of the right ventricle and eventually death1 ph is characterized by a mean pulmonary artery pressure mpap  25 mmhg at rest in addition to the treatment of relieving symptoms targeted therapy aiming to improve heart function extended three-year survival of pulmonary arterial hypertension pah from 39 to 7523 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first reported in wuhan china in last december4 studies observed severe damage in the lung which raised the hypothesis that ph patients might be more vulnerable than others5 subsequently the whole country was placed in lockdown to prevent the spread of the disease which potentially could compromise ph patient care all these factors made ph patients a potentially vulnerable group hereby we designed a questionnaire for ph patients to understand their disease condition mental condition medication supplement and requirements in medical care during covid-19 outbreak the survey would provide general information for future medical care and support to ph patients in such conditions the study was conducted by experts from congenital heart disease center at wuhan asia heart hospital in wuhan in collaboration with other ph centers and unofficial patients groups patients diagnosed with ph and their families were considered for the survey ph was defined as mpap  25 mmhg at rest all diagnosis was made according to right heart catheter examination a small-scale national online survey was performed ph patients and one of their family members were invited to participate in the survey via quick response qr code all answers were listed in non-medical descriptions and reviewed by unprofessional individuals for better understanding no personal information was included the study protocol and questionnaire were reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of wuhan asia heart hospital 2020-s-002 participants were given informed consent during the survey the questionnaire was designed by experts on ph in wuhan asia heart hospital wuhan china to understand the status of ph patients during covid-19 outbreak in china the questions were designed to cover the following issues 1 basic clinical information of the patients including age gender medical history of ph and current heart function 2 physical and mental conditions associated with covid-19 and 3 details of the medications they were using and requirements for medical care if any questions were designed in single choice and multiple choices yes or no were offered for most questions and answers other than choices were required to fill the questionnaire is still open for recruitment questionnaire in supplement here we present the preliminary data from the first respondents baseline characteristics are presented as number for categorical data and mean  standard deviation or median with interquartile range as appropriate for continuous data percentage is applied for illustrating constitution comparison was made between variables using students t-test or wilcoxon signed-rank test for continuous variables regarding their distributions and with the 2 test for categorical variables a p-value of  005 was considered as statistically significant all statistical analyses were performed with spss 230 ibm corp armonk ny over 300 individuals were invited to participate in this survey a total of 120 ph patients and 23 family members from 16 provinces responded from 1 march 2020 to 11 march 2020 all questionnaires were included in final analysis a total of 648 n  87 participants were from hubei among which 299 n  26 were from wuhan 133 n  19 were from henan 70 n  10 from anhui and 189 n  27 came from other 13 provinces as shown in fig 1 both patients and their family members completed the survey in 13 families however we failed to identify them due to the design table 1 shows general information of the participants overall participants were aged 323  115 years a total of 61 patients suffered ph more than seven years three family participants did not know ph history of their relatives possibly due to the different etiology6 chd-pah contributed most in ph groups 79 658 in patients 13 565 in family participants p  0001

 a total of 986 n  141 participants were in home quarantine during covid-19 outbreak table 1 shows the majority of participants 121 846 felt not much change on disease progress surprisingly most patients were with less severe symptoms as 469 n  67 participants proclaimed new york heart association heart functional class i and 44 308 were class ii a total of 833 n  100 patients and 913 n  21 family participants reported the disease progression was the same as before fatigue and less active was more reported in patients 20 vs 0 p  0026 however cough was common in both patients and family participants 58 vs 130 p  0203 as shown in fig 2 symptoms in others included not sleeping well chest pain aching pain in limbs and catching a cold but recovered there were three 25 patients hospitalized during covid-19 outbreak two of them were because of heart failure and one was due to pneumonia none of the family participants reported death of patients actually three patients passed away by 11 march 2020 one of the patients died due to an unexpected fall and unable to go to hospital during outbreak two died from worsening of pah all deaths were reported by family privately and not included in the survey
 fever is an important symptom indicating covid-19 in our survey 50 n  6 patients had fever with highest temperature of 398 one patient was confirmed sars-cov-2 infection and two patients reported covid-19 related symptoms cough in their families all family participants denied covid-19 related symptoms in either themselves or patients bosentan ambrisentan tadalafil and sildenafil were most commonly used medications for target therapy as shown in fig 3 specifically ambrisentan was preferred in 575 n  69 patients and 609 n  14 family participants a total of 216 n  26 patients and 261 n  6 family participants chose chinese generic ambrisentan because of the lower price in chinese generic medication there were 17 patients enrolling in clinical trial and using macitentan for free patients were more sensitive to the shortage of medications than family participants 62 517 vs 4 174 p  0003 there were 266 participants 29 in patients 9 in family participants who thought they had enough medications by the time of survey when it was at least 40 days after national lockdown as shown in fig 4a a total of 400 n  48 patients were able to buy more medications with great effort however 242 n  29 discontinued one or more medications there were 10 70 patients changing their medications without consulting their doctors as shown in fig 4a two of which previously took macitentan a total of 100 participants 699 thought they had medications shortage during covid-19 outbreak as shown in fig 4b
 over 200 patients n  29 and family participants n  6 had panic but most of them 89 622 thought protection was important as shown in fig 5a though 483 n  58 patients and 391 n  9 family participants felt bad due to the disease more than 70 85 in patients 18 in family participants participants still kept optimistic at the same time as shown in fig 5b

 both ph patients and their families requested further medical care despite of a lack of clear clinical worsening according to our survey a total of 117 n  14 patients and 261 n  6 family participants would like to contact their doctors during covid-19 outbreak 617 n  74 patients would go to the hospital for follow-up immediately after public transportation was available eight of whom preferred hospitalization and 609 n  14 family participants would ask their relatives with ph go to the hospital as soon as possible which was similar to patients additionally 739 n  17 family participants would also encourage patients to be more positive the outbreak of covid-19 changed most peoples life in last winter specifically patients with chronic diseases might suffer from the high risk of covid-19 and uncontrolled existing diseases at the same time ph patients require sustained medical care similar to other chronic diseases any interruption in medications may result in clinical worsening and death however their living condition during covid-19 was unknown our small-scale national survey brought an insight to this group the results of the questionnaire indicated that the incidence of covid-19 was not higher in ph patients according to our survey regardless of incidental cough and fever in our patients only one patient was confirmed sars-cov-2 infection medication insufficiency was the most common problem in our patients as nearly 70 participants implied their medications shortage during covid-19 outbreak a total of 242 patients discontinued medications and 70 patients changed their medications without consulting their doctor a total of 986 participants stayed at home during outbreak and most of them were not depressed by either ph or covid-19 according to our survey however further requirements in medical care might significantly increase due to the high desire of follow-up even hospitalization from both patients and their families when covid-19 outbreak is over in early studies covid-19 patients often stayed in wuhan for a while or had a history of exposure to confirmed cases family cluster was also observed in several cases7 there were 182 n  26 participants from wuhan in our study which might be the result of hospital location and one of the patients groups were from hubei none of them reported covid-19 neither in patients nor in family participants person-to-person transmission is confirmed in covid-198 and lockdown in wuhan began in 24 january 2020 to prevent further spread of this infectious disease a total of 986 of our patients and their families were in home quarantine during covid-19 outbreak which might be a key factor that prevented our patients being infected previous studies showed 3251 patients with covid-19 had existing diseases such as diabetes hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases males were more vulnerable mean age of the patients were 4955 years from different study cohort911 our participants were 33 years old at mean age which was much younger than previous covid-19 patients our study cohort consisted of 80 females which was quite different from the proportion of covid-19 in addition most of our patients were chd-pah and maintained a fairly well heart function therefore the younger age more females different etiology and better cardiac function in our ph patients might result in a lower incidence of covid-19 similar to any other chronic diseases ph patients have to take life-time medications and most of them had higher medication adherence12 bosentan was first used in pah in 200213 and it significantly improved six-minute walk distance and heart function since then targeted treatment has extended more than half of patients life to three or even five years14 combination therapy recommended in recent years has further reduced adverse events and slowed down the ph progression31517 in our study patients took ambrisentan more than bosentan partly due to the lower price in chinese generic medication a total of 17 patients were taking macitentan for free treprostinil was used in very few patients because of the high price and inconvenience of intravenous application18 luckily 400 of patients were able to continue their medications with great effort during the national lockdown different from other cardiovascular diseases ph target medications are expensive and unavailable in small cities which might result in the shortage of medications in our ph patients the lockdown in cities additionally prevented patients from getting supplement nearly 30 of patients either discontinued their medications or changed without consultation we have tried to help some of our patients to buy medications however shutdown of most public transportations made the process very difficult we could hardly predict the prognosis of those who changed their treatment for less than 40 days an interruption of treatment around three days might be tolerated19 but clinical worsening might happen due to the discontinuation of medications20 patients preferred clinic visiting to consult doctors for any modification our patients showed higher desire to contact their doctors even though we had provided online consultation before the survey mental condition of ph patients has aroused attentions in recent years their concerns about the invasive examination disease progression and social interactions may directly impact their tolerance to treatment21 the outbreak of covid-19 brought an unexpected crisis first in wuhan then spread to other cities surprisingly our ph patients and their families were mostly not panicking during the outbreak they were overall positive and optimistic even though there were shortages on their medications the reasons for such response might be as follows first most ph patients stayed at home which was familiar and comfort for them second there were not many clinical worsening in our patients their disease condition was mostly constant during the outbreak which maintained their optimism third we the doctors were active in patients groups including being available for consultation online and offering assistance for medication supplement all these might be helpful to reduce their anxiety our results provided preliminary view in living condition of ph patients during covid-19 in china however several limitations in our study need to be addressed first of all there were only 120 ph patients participating in the survey the small-scale survey might give us some general information which also might bring bias in some aspects the results might highlight chd-pah due to that chd-pah contributed most in the study population further study should try to include more patients to get more details the questionnaire was designed to generate the information from both patients and their family members however we failed to match patients with their family members from the beginning studies could avoid such mistakes and focus on patients more second the survey was started 35 days after wuhan lockdown and lasted 10 days most ph patients might be still stable in such a short time studies conducted later or longer might observe more clinical worsening and anxiety in patients and their families although no death was reported in our survey three patients passed away based on our knowledge neither patients nor their families would participate in the survey if they were in critical condition therefore our results might be more optimistic than real world follow-up to the real mortality has been initialed third there were many uncertainties in online survey we involved a question to estimate whether participants were seriously taking the survey the result showed 867 patients and 910 family participants went through the survey carefully which indicated there might be misunderstanding and incorrect answers our small-scale national survey first investigated the living condition of ph patients during covid-19 as the disease is spreading all over the world doctors should be aware that ph patients could be invulnerable to covid-19 if they are in good protection sustaining medical care including medication supplement is important for ph patients at this time covid-19 might impact ph patients psychologically other than physically higher hospitalization even death might been seen when the outbreak is over  journal pre-proof clinical value of immune-inflammatory parameters to assess the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 zhe zhu ting cai lingyan fan kehong lou xin hua zuoan huang

were independent risk factors for assessing the severity of covid-19 the risk model established upon il-6 crp and hypertension had the highest predictability in this study besides il-6 played a pivotal role in the severity of covid-19 and had a potential value for monitoring the process of severe cases  since december 2019 an unexperienced pneumonia emerged in wuhan china and soon spread globally guo et al 2020  wu et al 2020  this pneumonia was verified to be caused by a novel coronavirus and named as coronavirus disease 2019 by the world health organization who based on phylogeny taxonomy and established practice this novel coronavirus was designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by the coronavirus study group csg gorbalenya et al 2020  similar to the former two pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov at the beginning of the 21st century cui et al 2019  sars-cov-2 is likely originated from bat zhou peng et al 2020  have the ability to spread from person to person chan et al 2020  cause pneumonia and severe respiratory syndrome chen n et al

severity of covid-19 is crucial for delay or halt the progression of the disease previous studies have revealed that patients with old age and underlying diseases are more likely to be aggravated wang d et al 2020  wang z et al 2020  and aberrant immune-inflammatory response and cytokine storm may played an important role in the disease progression zhou yonggang et al 2020  therefore a retrospective study was performed to compare the clinical features immune-inflammatory parameters and cytokines between the severe and non-severe groups and tried to establish a predict model for assessing the severe cases in hwa pj-nbey-ky-2020-061-01 and a written informed consent was obtained from all enrolled patients throat-swab nasopharynx-swab and sputum specimens from all suspected

fibrinogen sialic acid sa c-reaction protein crp il-6 interleukin-10 il-10 and interferon- ifn- in the severe group were significantly higher than those in the non-severe group p005 while lymphocyte lymphocyte count and platelet count were significantly lower in the severe group when compared with the non-severe group p005 there were no significant differences in ctni and nt-probnp between the severe and non-severe groups as for the arterial blood gas parameters higher levels of po 2 and pco 2 were found in the non-severe group p005 while ph and lactate showed no differences between the two groups the result of multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the high level of peripheral blood cytokine il-6 crp and hypertension were independent risk factors for assessing the severity of covid-19 with odd ratios  figure 1  the baseline il-6 was positively correlated with neutrophil r0398  the dynamic changes of il-6 were analyzed in 45 non-severe cases and 12 severe cases the level of il-6 in the severe group was significantly higher than non-severe group at baseline and 5-10 days after disease onset but dropped gradually day-by-day and reached a level equal to

a cause for deleterious consequence during sars-cov-2 infection zhou yonggang et al 2020  in consist with the previous studies liu jing et al 2020  cytokine il-6 il-10 and ifn- in the severe group were significantly higher than those in the non-severe group especially for il-6 and it was recognized as an independent risk factor by using multivariate logistic regression analysis with or of 1090 95 ci 1040-1147 as mentioned above il-6 had the highest auroc among the inflammation parameters in this study so we further analyzed their correlations it was found that il-6 was significantly correlated with other inflammation parameters and a most close relationship was observed between il-6 and il-10 r0638 p0001 il-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine the increased of il-10 maybe reflect a self-protection during cytokine storm the level of il-10 was also directly related to the degree of inflammation chousterman et al 2017  and high il-10 was associated with immunosuppression in sepsis hotchkiss et al 2013  il-6 plays a key role in cytokine storm owing to its pleiotropic property gupta et al 2020  apart from its robust proinflammatory function it induces a variety of in line with prior studies our study also demonstrated that severe cases were older and more likely to have underlying diseases wang d et al 2020  wang z et al 2020  however apart from hypertension the number of patients with and without diabetes cardiovascular disease hepatic disease chronic lung disease and cancer an evaluation version of novapdf was used to create this pdf file purchase a license to

number in hypertension is sufficient to make a certain comparison additionally the level of il-6 in patients with hypertension was higher than those without hypertension in this study demonstrated a severe inflammation lesion in the hypertension patients hypertension patients are always associated with immune activation resulted in immune system impaired norlander et al 2018  therefore we speculated that the abnormal immune function of hypertension patients may played a role in the covid-19 progression intriguingly angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace-2 played a protect role in hypertension povlsen et al 2020  while sars-cov-2 use ace-2 to enter target cells and may reduce ace-2 expression just like sars-cov do kuba et al 2005  which was likely to carry a burden to those weakness patients and aggravate the disease eventually in this study the existing of hypertension severed as an independent risk factor for the severity of covid-19 it reminded us to take specially care of these high-risk patients to prevent the development of disease ctni and nt-probnp are two biomarkers for cardiac dysfunction the baseline level of ctni in the most patients with covid-19 was below 003 ngml no significant difference was found between the severe and non-severe groups so did the level of nt-probnp it was consistent with the study by peng et al in which tests were performed on admission peng et al 2020  however chen et al found the elevated ctni and nt-probnp during hospitalization were significantly correlated with the critical disease status chen chen et al 2020

markers dynamically the value of them deserve further investigation a blood gas analysis can measures the level of oxygen carbon dioxide lactate and ph in the blood which is helpful to show how well the lungs are working a previous study has indicated that higher level of lactate and lower levels of po 2 and pco 2 were found in the death patients with covid-19 peng et al 2020  the present study also showed lower levels of po 2 and pco 2 in the severe group but ph and lactate showed no differences between the two groups however only few patients in the non-severe group performed blood gas analyses and partial patients received oxygen therapy before blood gas analysis thus making it difficult to explore their role in the present study however this study has some limitations first il-6 is not a routine laboratory test which would limit its usage second the sample size included in this study is relatively small especially of those in severe group third it is a retrospective single-center study the effectiveness of this model has not been validated by us and others forth some laboratory analyses eg blood gas analysis were performed on partial patients therefore a prospective multi-center study with a larger sample size is warranted our study demonstrated that high level of peripheral blood cytokine il-6 crp and the existence of hypertension were independent

sars-cov-2 along with the highly infectious capacity of the virus the mortality rates have been reported to range from 1 to 51 it has been reported that patients with covid-19 and hypertension may have an increased risk for adverse outcomes in unadjusted epidemiological studies summarizing the characteristics of the covid-19 epidemic in china despite limited sample sizes previous studies have reported that hypertension had a hazard ratio hr of 170 95 confidence interval ci 092314 to 305 95 ci 157592 for mortality respectively23 however neither of these previous studies has adjusted for confounding factors for example age which is emerging as the strongest predictor of covid-19-related death34 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is required for viral entry of sars-cov-25 ace2 is widely expressed in the human body with expression found in the gastrointestinal tract heart and kidney and alveolar cells in the lungs67 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceis and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs are the two types of reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas inhibitors widely used for treating hypertension and heart and renal failure there are reports in animal models8 and humans9 suggesting that the expression of ace2 may be increased after treatment with an acei or arb some reports incriminated only arbs10 which might augment patients susceptibility to viral host cell entry and propagation11 although the effects of aceis or arbs on ace2 in humans are still inconclusive previous findings have led to a growing concern that aceis or arbs may increase or decrease mortality in patients with covid-191213 therefore evidence of the impact of these medications in patients with covid-19 is urgently needed here we investigated 2877 consecutive patients admitted to huo shen shan hospital which is a hospital dedicated solely to the treatment of covid-19 in wuhan china we tested the hypothesis that treatment of hypertension especially with raas inhibitors might impact on the mortality of patients with covid-19 this is a retrospective observational study comparing the association of both hypertensive status and antihypertensive treatment class with mortality among hospitalized patients with covid-19 all patients admitted to huo shen shan hospital wuhan china from 5 february to 15 march 2020 with confirmed covid-19 were included in this study huo shen shan hospital was opened by the government on 5 february 2020 and assigned to treat exclusively covid-19 patients patients with covid-19 included in this study were diagnosed according to world health organization interim guidance and diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia from the the national health commission of china1415 in brief clinical manifestations of covid-19 are defined as the development of fever andor respiratory symptoms computed tomography ct imaging showing characteristics consistent with covid-19 or normal or decreased white blood cell wbc count and normal or decreased lymphocyte count in the early stage of the disease patients with a suspicious epidemiological history ie contact with novel coronavirus-infected people or patients from wuhan who have fever or respiratory symptoms plus any two clinical manifestations or no clear epidemiological history but with all three clinical manifestations were considered as possible covid-19 case patients who were considered as possible covid-19 cases with or without laboratory confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection were admitted to the huo shen shan hospital the confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection was defined as suspect cases with one of the following serological findings i real-time fluorescent reverse transcriptionpcr rtpcr positive for new coronavirus nucleic acid ii viral gene sequence highly homologous to known new coronaviruses and iii sars-cov-2-specific igm or igg are detected in serum or sars-cov-2-specific igg is detectable or reaches a titration of at least a four-fold increase during convalescence compared with the acute phase this study was approved by the national health commission of china and the institutional review board at huo shen shan hospital wuhan china written informed consent was waived by the ethics committee of the designated hospital for patients with emerging infectious diseases patients demographic characteristics and clinical data symptoms comorbidities laboratory findings and outcomes during hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records by two investigators rz and yc all data were independently reviewed and entered into the computer database by two analysts cg and yc the primary endpoint was all-cause mortality during hospitalization other endpoints included the time elapsed between onset of symptoms and discharge the rates of use of invasive mechanical ventilation and the severity of covid-19 the severity of covid-19 was categorized as mild severe or critical mild included non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia cases severe was characterized by dyspnoea respiratory frequency 30min blood oxygen saturation 93 pao2fio2 ratio 300 andor lung infiltrates 50 within 2448 h critical cases were defined as respiratory failure requiring mechanic ventilation septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunctionfailure116 the final date of follow-up was 1 april 2020 and the median duration of follow-up hospitalization was 21 1232 days the diagnosis of hypertension was given by the patients physician prior to the infection with sars-cov-2 these data were collected from patients documented medical files eg the diagnosed patients with antihypertensive drugs and blood pressure 14090 mmhg upon admission were still identified as with a history of hypertension there was no formal committee to adjudicate the status of hypertension however these diagnoses were rechecked by two individual investigators rz and yc during data collection using office systolic blood pressure 140 mmhg andor diastolic blood pressure values 90 mmhg17 as the criteria 
figure 1 shows the flow chart of the study the antihypertensive regimens were in principle unchanged during hospitalization whenever the patients had previous prescriptions before admission discontinuation or alteration of the antihypertensive treatment during hospitalization was at the physicians discretion those who required antihypertensive medication during hospitalization with no prior prescription or those who had discontinued the medications prior to admission were treated with calcium channel blockers ccbs or diuretics the cohorts of without antihypertensive and with antihypertensive treatments as well as the cohorts of raas inhibitors aceiarbs and non-raas inhibitors beta-blockers ccbs or diuretics  were stratified at the time of their admission and according to their pre-admission medications there were 15 patients no death events taking spirolactone but were categorized in the non-raas inhibitors group in the analysis patients were included in the raas inhibitor cohort whenever at least one raas inhibitor an acei or arb was prescribed disregarding whether or not they were treated with a beta-blocker ccb or diuretics nevertheless a sensitivity analysis was performed by including patients who were treated solely with one medication supplementary material online table s3

conflict of interest none declared  association of hypertension diabetes stroke cancer kidney disease and high-cholesterol with covid-19 disease severity and fatality a systematic review nazar zaki hany alashwal sahar ibrahim   the recent outbreak of the novel covid-19 disease and its rapid worldwide spread poses a global health emergency the novel virus is thought to belong to the same family as middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus but it is unique in its own right 1 researchers around the globe are investigating several risk factors that may contribute to the severity of covid-19 the world health organization who indicated that elderly individuals as well as those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of developing severe covid-19 disease 2 as of today june 14th 2020 more than 7800 million people are infected by the virus and more than 430500 have lost their lives most of the deaths are believed to be associated with the existence of comorbidities generally patients with compromised immune systems are considered to be particularly vulnerable 3 several research works have targeted the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients infected with covid-19 however the risk factors for severity and mortality have not been sufficiently investigated 4 identifying major risk factors and taking corresponding clinical measures could contribute massively to saving lives most of the previous studies have identified comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes mellitus stroke cancer kidney issues and high cholesterol among the high-risk factors thus this paper represents a systematic review of the literature to shed light on the effects of these pre-existing conditions on covid-19 disease severity additionally as no method currently exists that can determine the level of risk these comorbidities pose this paper serves the purpose of achieving the only reasonable option to draw lessons from earlier experiences and practices a search was conducted on the freely available covid-19 open research dataset cord-19 5 cord-19 is a resource consisting of 128000 scholarly articles including over 59000 articles with full text related to covid-19 sars-cov-2 and coronaviruses the dataset is frequently updated when new research appears in peer-reviewed publications and archive services became available to screen every article in the dataset we developed a search engine in addition to the bm25 search index 6 bm25 is a retrieval function that ranks a set of documents based on the query terms appearing in each document regardless of their proximity within the document all papers are indexed by simply applying a preprocessing function to clean and tokenize the abstracts once all documents were indexed we created document vectors by loading optimized cached json tokens followed by applying a document similarity index using annoy 7 for more details of the

coronavirussars-cov-2ncovcovid-19 disease severity mortality icu the search terms are repeated for all the comorbidities considered in this paper diabetes is one of the most serious comorbidities linked to the severity of all three well-known human pathogenic coronavirus infections including sars-cov 2 patients with diabetes have an increased risk of severe complications including adult respiratory distress syndrome ards and multi-organ failure depending on the global region 2050 of covid-19 pandemic patients had diabetes which emphasizes the importance of the link between covid-19 and diabetes 8 according to gupta et al 9 individuals with diabetes are at risk of infections especially influenza and pneumonia patients with diabetes are severely affected when they contract respiratory viruses therefore diabetes was seen as an important risk factor for mortality in patients infected with pandemic influenza a 2009 h1n1 sars coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus merscov 10 11 12 several studies show that among the covid-19 patients there was also a noticeable percentage of patients suffering from diabetes mellitus dm yang et al 13 found that among the 32 non-survivors from a group of 52 covid-19 patients 22 were diabetes patients additionally out of 1099 patients with confirmed covid-19 from autonomous regions in china 173 had severe disease with comorbidities in which 162 were dm 14 zhang et al 15 analyzed data for 140 patients who were admitted to hospitals in wuhan china with confirmed covid-19 cases 121 of these patients had diabetes moreover zhang et al 16 reviewed 258 confirmed covid-19 patients who were hospitalized in wuhan china the authors indicated that patients with diabetes had significantly higher leukocyte and neutrophil counts as well as higher levels of fasting blood glucose serum creatinine urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme mb at admission compared to those without diabetes the cox proportional hazard model showed that diabetes adjusted hazard ratio ahr  364 95 ci 1091221 and fasting blood glucose ahr  119 95 ci 108131 were associated with the fatality of covid-19 adjusting for potential confounders the authors concluded that dm is associated with greater disease severity and therefore recommended that primary and secondary prevention strategies are needed for covid-19 patients with diabetes bloomgarden et al 17 stated that mortality rates from pneumonia among patients with diabetes in hong kong age  75 exceed mortality rates in this age group from cardiovascular disease and cancer 18 similar evidence of risk amid persons with diabetes has been reported for the two earlier cov infections sars in 2002 1920 and mers in 2012 21 furthermore diabetes was present in 423 of 26 fatalities due to covid-19 in a study from wuhan china 22 huang et al 23 investigated 41 hospital-admitted patients identified as having a laboratory-confirmed 2019-ncov infection however these cases are only a small proportion of the patients affected a report of 72314 cases with 44672 confirmed covid-19 cases published by the chinese centre for disease control and prevention showed an increased mortality rate in people with diabetes 23 overall and 73 in patients with diabetes 24 bello-chavolla oy 25 predicted mortality due to sars-cov-2 and developed a mechanistic score relating to obesity and diabetes to covid-19 outcomes in data from mexico among 71103 subjects the authors observed 15529 subjects with sars-cov-2 and 1434 deaths from sars-cov-2 or other causes risk factors for lethality in covid-19 included early-onset diabetes obesity advanced age immunosuppression and ckd the authors used stratified points the score of diabetes was 1 which indicated mild risk out of the 137 deaths from sars-cov-2 276 had diabetes a total of 174 patients confirmed with covid19 were studied by guo et al 26 the authors found that 24 patients with no other comorbidities except diabetes were at higher risk of severe pneumonia the release of tissue injuryrelated enzymes excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism the authors recommended that diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for rapid progression and poor prognosis of covid19 the authors described a mortality rate of covid-19 amongst diabetic patients without other comorbidities of about 16 the above-mentioned studies are summarized in table 1
 it is apparent that individuals with diabetes are at an increased risk for covid-19 infection and medical complications including death suggestions are made on the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and covid-19 and its management no definite conclusions can be made based on current limited evidence and data 9 further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted 27 furthermore the article by guo et al 28 has left several relevant questions to be addressed does the association between covid19 and diabetes differ by different types of diabetes do antidiabetic drugs have an impact on disease progression is the impact of aging the same in diabetics as is in those without diabetes while the results of this study should be read in the light of some limitations such as the small sample size and the large age difference between study groups when patients with other comorbidities were excluded it still provides relevant insights that could inform about how covid-19 interacts with preexisting conditions 29 according to a few recently published results mainly chinese cohort patients with cancer are more vulnerable to covid-19 complications however how susceptible cancer patients are to infection with covid-19 has yet to be established liang et al 30 collected and analyzed 2007 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions in china all cases were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 the number of covid-19 cases with a history of cancer is 18 1 95 ci 061165 out of 1590 covid-19 cases which according to 2015 cancer epidemiology statistics seems to be higher than the incidence of cancer in the overall chinese population 029 per 100000 people lung cancer was the most frequent type 28 compared with patients without cancer patients with cancer were relatively older had no significant differences in sex other baseline symptoms other comorbidities or baseline severity of x-ray most importantly patients with cancer were observed to have a higher risk of severe events compared to patients without cancer 39 vs 8 of 1572 patients fishers exact p  00003 the authors concluded that patients with cancer might have a higher risk of covid-19 than individuals without cancer additionally they showed that patients with cancer had poorer outcomes from covid-19 providing a timely reminder to physicians that cancer patients require intensive care while infected zhang et al 31 regarded cancer patients as a highly vulnerable group in the current covid-19 pandemic the authors included 28 cancer patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 from 3 designated hospitals in wuhan china from jan 2020 to feb 26 2020 the authors mentioned that cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the covid-19 infection in addition yu et al 32 reviewed the medical records including demographic clinical and treatment data of 1524 patients in wuhan china from dec 30 2019 to feb 17 2020 outcomes of covid-19 among patients with cancer were reported the authors estimated the infection rate of sars-cov-2 in patients with cancer from a single institution to be 079 12 of 1524 patients 95 ci 0312 this was higher than the cumulative incidence of all diagnosed covid-19 cases that were reported in the city of wuhan over the same time 037 41152 of 11081000 cases data cutoff on february 17 2020 of the 1524 patients with cancer who were screened 228 had non-small-cell lung carcinoma nsclc the authors stated that patients with nsclc older than 60 years had a higher incidence of covid-19 than those aged 60 years or younger 43 vs 18 in table 2
 we summarize the details of the three mentioned case studies in these mentioned studies lung cancer was most frequently observed and the covid-19 cases analyzed were all from hospitals in china however according to moujaess et al 33 such reports could lead many oncologists to change their daily practice in cancer care without solid evidence and recommendations the data presented should be carefully interpreted not only because of the small sample but also because cancer patients in this cohort mentioned in ref 30 for instance had a significantly older median age than their control 631 vs 487 years as well as a more significant history of smoking suggesting that these two factors might be associated with the poor covid-19 outcomes than the cancer history itself moreover these results should be interpreted with caution in the absence of adjustment to the prevalence of the different comorbidities in the chinese population 33 also xia et al 34 commented on the mentioned studies and highlighted reasons to be cautious suggesting that current evidence remains insufficient to explain a conclusive association between cancer and covid-19 though one effect that has risen concern is due to the number of covid-19 patients surpassing hospital and healthcare capacity cancer patients may be overlooked resulting in negative consequences in their treatments high blood pressure hypertension is one of the most common conditions in severe covid-19 patients 35 in this section we review several studies that looked at the relationship between hypertension and the severity of covid-19 the relationship between high blood pressure and increased risk of pneumonia was a subject of a study that analyzed uk biobank data of 107310 hypertension patients with 3 of patients developing pneumonia afterward 36 the data analysis shows that the risk of respiratory disease is significantly higher in patients with hypertension patients with hypertension were also found to be at higher risk of acute respiratory disease and chronic lower respiratory disease independent of age sex smoking status and bmi generalizing these results to covid-19 is plausible and led to many studies that focus on hypertension as a strong indication of covid-19 severity several recent studies have investigated the variability in covid-19 disease severity in patients with hypertension and its medicinal therapy in ref 37 the authors reported that among 3017 hospitalized covid-19 patients 53 were diagnosed with hypertension furthermore the mortality rates among patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors acei for hypertension treatment 27 p  0001 as well as for patients on angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs 33 p  012 were lower compared to other anti-hypertensive agents 39 therefore these results support the continuation of acei and arb therapy for covid-19 hypertensive patients these results are supported by another study 38 where 126 covid-19 patients with hypertension were retrospectively grouped into arbsaceis n  43 and non-arbsaceis n  83 according to their antihypertensive medications a group of covid-19 patients without hypertension were then randomly selected to match the previous group based on age and sex the results of this study show that the arbsaceis group had a lower proportion of critical patients 93 vs 229 p  0061 and a lower death rate 47 vs 133 p  0216 however these differences are not statistically significant similarly liu et al 39 investigated the disease severity in patients with hypertension who used acei arb ccb and beta-blockers bb compared to patients who did not take any hypertension medication considering only 46 elderly patients age  65 the results show that patients who took arb have a significantly lower risk of developing a severe disease compared to patients who took no drugs however although patients who took acei ccb and bb also had a lower risk of developing severe disease there was no statistical significance compared to patients who took no drugs this could be due to the limited number of patients on these drugs compared to arb in another study 40 the authors argued based on their retrospective investigation of different hypertension drugs that calcium channel blockers ccbs show significant efficacy on covid-19 patients they also conducted in vitro experiments to examine the efficacy of ccbs and other hypertension drugs on blocking sars-cov-2 replication in cells the results show that only ccbs block virus replication however the blocking mechanism is not apparent therefore further investigations of ccbs efficacy on post-entry virus replication in vitro and clinically are needed although the studies cited above show hypertension medications are beneficial for covid-19 patients a recent retrospective observational study 41 found that patients with hypertension who took aceiarb drugs have a higher risk of developing a severe case of covid-19 p  0064 however this is not a statistically significant difference and may be due to the limited number of patients with hypertension 75 out of 274 covid-19 patients also the group of patients with hypertension were older and had more comorbidities such as chronic renal insufficiency cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular disease than patients without hypertension interestingly another study 42 hypothesizes that hypertension treatment with acei and arbs which results in an upregulation of ace2 may increase the risk of developing severe covid-19 this is based on a structural study suggesting that sars-cov-2 uses ace2 as its receptor 43 it was also noted that ccb treatment of hypertension does not lead to an upregulation of ace2 which in turn makes it a safe treatment of hypertension in covid-19 patients however this theory is not supported by the previously cited retrospective studies on covid-19 patients who took acei and arbs 37 besides sanchis-gomar et al 44 noted that several health organizations have recommended the continued use of aceis and arbs for treating hypertension in covid-19 patients they also found based on their review study that there are no significant differences between aceis and arbs for managing hypertension with arbs being a more favorable option for severe cases of covid-19 we also reviewed several articles that employed systematic reviews and meta-analysis of published studies on the effects of hypertension on covid-19 disease severity in ref 45 systematic reviews show that hypertension is one of the major comorbidities of fatality covid-19 cases similarly zuin et al 46 carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis that show covid-19 patients with hypertension have a significantly higher mortality risk however it is noted that further studies of other comorbidities either linked or not linked to hypertension are needed also roncon et al 47 looked at the rate of icu admission of covid-19 patients with hypertension they found that among the 1382 patients mean age  515 years 5774 males patients with hypertension had a significantly increased risk of icu admission or  254 95 ci 183354 p  00001 the above-mentioned cases are summarized in table 3
 hypertension like diabetes has been proven to be linked to a significantly higher risk of respiratory infection making it a solid indicator of covid-19 severity additionally systematic reviews indicate hypertension to be common comorbidity in covid-19 death cases as well as be linked to significantly higher mortality risk and increased incidence of icu admission although it should be noted that further studies of other comorbidities connected to hypertension are necessary nonetheless it is evident that many patients with the virus also suffer from hypertension and as a result the comorbidity as well as its medicinal therapies on covid-19 have been observed it is also found that hypertension treatment should be continued to lower the severity risk some researchers recommended ccbs treatment and others found there are no significant differences in using aceis arbs or ccbs however there seems to be a general agreement with most health organizations who recommended hypertension treatment to be continued in covid-19 patients 44 cholesterol level alteration has been found to occur during a viral infection such as hiv and hepatitis c virus hcv 48 the mechanism of alteration involves the virus binding to the scavenger receptor b type 1 sr-b1 that facilitates the selective uptake of high-density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol and other lipid components of receptor-bound hdl particles including free cholesterol fc and triglycerides tg 49 also it has been found that membrane cholesterol is an important component to facilitate viral entry into host cells 50 the role of cholesterol in viral infection was investigated even before the current pandemic of sars-cov-2 ren et al 51 found that cholesterol depletion from the cellular membrane significantly impaired the efficiency of viral infection however this study was carried out in vitro on cells from swine testicles st and baby hamster kidney cells bhk21 wei et al 49 studied the cholesterol metabolism of covid-19 patients compared to the normal reference population in general they found that fc hdl and ldl cholesterol level is significantly low for covid-19 patients compare to the reference population tg levels were also lower but not at a significant level moreover cholesterol metabolism of mild moderate severe and critical covid-19 patients was also presented and discussed the levels of hdl-c were significantly lower in patients with severe and critical disease than in patients with moderate or mild disease in another study 52 hdl cholesterol levels along with serum albumin levels were used as predictors for the severity of covid-19 disease the study investigated the differences in clinical features between mild and severe covid-19 patients other features studied included hypoproteinemia hypoalbuminemia and decreased apoa1 patients were grouped into two types mild and severe and those in critical condition were not included it was also noted that patients with severe disease were significantly older median age 58 compared to patients with mild disease median age 37 their results show that patients with severe disease have significantly lower hdl cholesterol they also observed increased levels of albumin and hdl cholesterol in patients who were at the late stage of recovering from covid-19 another recent study 53 looked at the serum cholesterol level in patients with covid-19 in wenzhou china the laboratory test results show that patients had significantly low fc hdl-cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol levels compared to healthy control moreover they investigated the cholesterol levels in two categories of patients primary infection cases being those who had been in wuhan and secondary infection cases being those who had never been in wuhan but were infected by person-to-person transmission they reported that hdl-cholesterol in the primary infection group was significantly lower than in the secondary infection group similar to the results in ref 52 the cholesterol levels of fc hdl and ldl were improving as patients recovered the inverse correlation between hdl cholesterol level and severity of covid-19 is also highlighted in ref 54 the author argued that taking statin drug therapy for cholesterol may increase covid-19 infections statins are drugs used to lower cholesterol and protect against a heart attack and stroke taking statins results in very low or no production of endogenous cholesterol which leads to the upregulation of ldl in the cell membrane this as stated earlier is found to be an important component to facilitate viral entry into host cells overview of articles investigating cholesterol levels in covid-19 patients is summarized in table 4
 cholesterol has previously been investigated concerning many viral infections typically there is a selective uptake of cholesterol as viruses bind to the cellular membrane which ultimately enables severe infection therefore analyses have been conducted on the connection between covid-19 and cholesterol most publications indicated that fc hdl and ldl cholesterol levels were significantly low in patients with a viral infection compared to the control these studies explained the ability of sars-cov-2 virus to use serum cholesterol for its entry into host cells therefore low serum cholesterol level can be used as an early predictor of covid-19 severity in patients also observing improvement in serum cholesterol levels may indicate the improvement of conditions in patients it is also worth noting that statin drugs for cholesterol may contribute to the severity of covid-19 disease by inhibiting endogenous cholesterol leading to the upregulation of ldl this leads to higher membrane cholesterol levels that enhance the ability of sars-cov-2 to enter host cells apart from fever and respiratory complications acute kidney injury has been observed in some patients with covid-19 to investigate the possible cause of kidney damage in covid-19 patients lin et al 55 used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data as well as an independent unpublished kidney single-cell rna-seq data generated in-house to evaluate ace2 gene expressions in all cell types of healthy kidneys and bladders the results showed the enriched expression of all subtypes of proximal tubule cells of the kidney and low but detectable levels of expression in bladder epithelial cells these results indicated the urinary system is a potential route for covid-19 infection along with the respiratory system and digestion system the findings suggested the kidney abnormalities of sars and covid-19 patients may be due to proximal tubule cell damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury beyond that laboratory tests of viruses and related indicators in urine may be needed in some special patients of covid-19 as for the novel coronavirus a recent study reported that the human kidney is a specific target for sars-cov-2 infection 56 the authors examined the viral nucleocapsid protein in situ in the kidney post-mortem and found that sars-cov-2 antigens accumulated in kidney tubules suggesting that sars-cov-2 infects the human kidney directly inducing aki and contributing to viral spreading in the body 57 alberici et al 58 describe 20 kidney transplant recipients median age 59 years 80 male with sars-cov2 induced pneumonia all patients presented with fever but only one complained of difficulty in breathing overall 5 kidney transplant recipients died after a median period of 15 days from symptom onset these preliminary findings describe a rapid clinical deterioration associated with chest radiographic deterioration and escalating oxygen requirement in renal transplant recipients with sars-cov2 pneumonia thus in this limited cohort of long-term kidney transplant patients sars-cov-2 induced pneumonia is characterized by a high risk of progression and significant mortality wang et al 59 conducted a study on one male patient age 49 with a history of close contact with a confirmed covid-19 case type 2 diabetes for 20 years and hypertension for 10 years the patient underwent comprehensive treatment for covid-19 organ transplant patients with covid-19 infection might have poorer prognosis because of their systemic immunosuppressive state however this severe case was cured even without discontinuing or reducing his immunosuppressant therapy this immunosuppressed case might help physicians to establish optimal treatment strategies for similar severe cases whether covid-19 causes significant acute kidney injury aki remains controversial zhou et al 60 retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics urine and blood routine tests as well as other laboratory parameters of 178 hospitalized covid-19 patients in wuhan china a total of 5 28 patients showed increased blood urea nitrogen bun indicating a few cases with kidney dysfunction however among the 83 466 patients with no history of kidney disease who received routine urine test upon hospitalization 45 542 patients displayed abnormality in urinalyses such as proteinuria hematuria and leukocyturia and none of the patients were recorded to have acute kidney injury aki throughout the study meanwhile the patients with abnormal urinalysis typically displayed worse disease progression that was reflected through laboratory parameter presentations including markers of liver injury inflammation and coagulation the authors concluded that urinalysis is better in unveiling potential kidney impairment of covid-19 patients than blood chemistry tests additionally urinalysis could be used to reflect and predict disease severity cheng et al 61 determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury aki in patients with covid-19 and evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with covid-19 the authors studied a cohort of 701 patients with covid-19 in wuhan during 2020 of whom 113 161 died in hospitals during the study period aki occurred in 51 of patients kaplan-meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk of in-hospital death thus the authors believed that the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of aki during hospitalization in patients with covid-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality hence clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe covid-19 overview of articles investigating kidney disease among covid-19 patients is summarized in table 5
 in addition to the multiple complications observed acute kidney injury has also been detected in covid-19 patients results indicated the urinary system respiratory system and digestion system as potential routes for the covid-19 infection one study indicating the human kidney to be a specific target of the virus findings propose kidney abnormalities in covid-19 patients may be due to proximal tubule cell damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury additionally in one study sars-cov-2 antigens were seen to accumulate in kidney tubules implying the direct impact on the kidney leading to aki induction and viral spread within the body there have also been studies describing a rapid clinical deterioration escalating oxygen requirement high risk of progression and significant mortality in kidney transplant patients similarly the incidence of kidney disease on admission as well as the development of aki is correlated with fatality in covid-19 patients however if covid-19 causes acute kidney injury remains uncertain many authors concluded that clinicians must still try to increase their awareness of kidney issues in patients with severe infection and a urinalysis may be used to predict the extent of disease severity acute stroke remains a medical emergency even during the covid-19 pandemic avula et al 62 investigated 4 patients with covid-19 that also presented acute stroke all 4 patients had radiographic evidence of stroke and pcr-confirmed covid-19 infection the authors elucidated the clinical characteristics imaging findings and the clinical course they warned that covid-19 patients can present with cerebrovascular accidents and should use appropriate personal protective equipment in every suspected patient further studies are urgently needed to improve the current understandings of neurological pathology in the setting of covid-19 infection klok et al 63 evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of ischemic stroke in 184 patients admitted to the icu of 3 dutch hospitals the patients were proven to have covid-19 induced pneumonia of whom 23 died 13 all patients received at least the standard doses of thromboprophylaxis the 31 incidence of thrombotic complications in icu patients with covid-19 infections is remarkably high therefore the authors recommended to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all covid-19 patients admitted to the icu lodigiani et al 64 studied 388 symptomatic patients 16 requiring icu admittance with laboratory-proven covid-19 admitted to a university hospital in milan italy the primary outcome was a thromboembolic complication including venous thromboembolism vte ischemic stroke and acute coronary syndrome acsmyocardial infarction mi the high number of arterial and in particular venous thromboembolic events diagnosed within 24 h of admission as well as the high rate of positive vte imaging tests among the few covid-19 patients tested suggest that there is an urgent need to improve specific vte diagnostic strategies as well as investigate the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory covid-19 patients mao et al 65 studied the neurologic manifestations of patients with covid-19 in wuhan china the authors collected data from 3 designated special care centers for covid-19 of the union hospital of huazhong university of science and technology in wuhan china the study included 214 mean age 727 years 407 men 589 had a non-severe infection and 88 patients 411 had a severe infection consecutive hospitalized patient with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of covid-19 however it has not been reported that patients with covid-19 had any neurologic manifestations in a note to eur neurol journal editor morelli et al 66 mentioned that between february 21 2020 first covid-19 patient recorded in italy and march 25 2020 there were only 6 admissions from the casualty department for ischemic stroke the authors suggested that the reason could be the controversial role il-6 plays in stroke although high il-6 levels have been reported to harm brain infarct volume and long-term outcome 67 in ischemic stroke there has also been experimental evidence that il-6 has a protective effect and helps in the improvement of poststroke angiogenesis 68 this could also be due to the presence of thrombocytopenia in covid-19 patients indeed what may be true for influenza pneumonia ie increased stroke risk may not be true for sarscov-2 the main limitation of the remark however is certainly the short observation period of just 1 month oxley et al 69 reported 5 4 male 1 female large-vessel stroke patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 who presented in the health system of new york city severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection was diagnosed in all five patients although the patients were having covid-19 related symptoms such as fever cough and lethargy all of them had a reduced nih stroke scalescore nihss overview of articles investigating stroke among covid-19 patients is summarized in table 6
 one study identified 364 of covid patients to have neurological symptoms mainly in patients with severe disease and several mechanisms of covid-19 that increase stroke risk have been recognized but neither has been proven as significant further studies are required to investigate the neurological pathology during covid-19 infection additionally there may be a need to improve specific vte diagnostic strategies the safety of thromboprophylaxis and further identify the role il-6 plays in ischemic stroke however the risks associated with ischemic stroke in covid-19 patients are still uncertain as with cancer patients medical resources must be allocated to target the strain covid-19 has placed on ischemic stroke care meanwhile the relationship between covid-19 and stroke must be examined further the studies reviewed in this paper have assessed the effects of diabetes cancer hypertension high cholesterol kidney issues and stroke on covid-19 severity through a thorough examination of the evidence provided in these reports inferences on the relationship between these preexisting conditions and covid-19 can be made in conclusion it can be observed that diabetes hypertension and cholesterol levels possess an apparent relation to covid-19 severity other comorbidities such as cancer kidney issues and stroke must be further evaluated to detect a strong relationship to the virus additionally treatment options must be examined further to provide optimal treatment and ensure better outcomes for patients suffering from these comorbidities however it should be noted that whether definitive measurements exist or not the care of patients as well as the research involved should be largely prioritized to tackle this deadly pandemic the authors declare that they have no competing interests  association of hypertension diabetes stroke cancer kidney disease and high-cholesterol with covid-19 disease severity and fatality a systematic review nazar zaki hany alashwal sahar ibrahim  objective to undertake a review and critical appraisal of publishedpreprint reports that offer methods of determining the effects of hypertension diabetes stroke cancer kidney issues and high-cholesterol on covid-19 disease severity  the recent outbreak of the novel covid-19 disease and its rapid worldwide spread poses a global health emergency the novel virus is thought to belong to the same family as middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus but it is unique in its own right 10  researchers around the globe are investigating several risk factors that may contribute to the severity of covid-19 the world health organization who indicated that elderly individuals as well as those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of developing severe covid-19 disease 11  as of today june 14 th  2020 more than 7800 million people are infected by the virus and more than 430500 have lost their lives most of the deaths are believed to be associated with the existence of comorbidities generally patients with compromised immune systems are considered to be particularly vulnerable 12  several research works have targeted the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients infected with covid-19 however the risk factors for severity and mortality have not been sufficiently investigated 13  identifying major risk factors and taking corresponding clinical measures could contribute massively to saving lives most of the previous studies have identified comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes mellitus stroke cancer kidney issues and high cholesterol among the high-risk factors thus this paper represents a systematic review of the literature to shed light on the effects of these pre-existing conditions on covid-19 disease severity additionally as no method currently exists that can determine the level of risk these comorbidities pose this paper serves the purpose of achieving the only reasonable option to draw lessons from earlier experiences and practices a search was conducted on the freely available covid-19 open research dataset cord-19 14  cord-19 is a resource consisting of 128000 scholarly articles including over 59000 articles with full text related to covid-19 sars-cov-2 and coronaviruses the dataset is frequently updated when new research appears in peer-reviewed publications and archive services became available to screen every article in the dataset we developed a search engine in addition to the bm25 search index 15  bm25 is a retrieval function that ranks a set of documents based on the query terms appearing in each document regardless of their proximity within the document all papers are indexed by simply applying a preprocessing function to clean and tokenize the abstracts once all documents were indexed we created document vectors by loading optimized cached json tokens followed by applying a document similarity index using annoy 16  annoy is a c library with python bindings to search for documents in space that are close to a given query for more details of the implantation please visit httpsgithubcomdgunningcord19 filtering of the articles was then undertaken using keywords and questions eg effects of diabetes on covidnormal coronavirussars-cov-2ncovcovid-19 disease severity mortality the search terms are repeated for all the comorbidities considered in this paper as illustrated in fig 1  a systematic approach was used to screen the full covid-19 open research dataset 14  through the systematic method 68 articles were found that scored highly on the confidence rating an additional search was run employing google scholar and pubmed to ensure every relevant article was included each of the 68 papers was read thoroughly causing 34 articles to be excluded from the list and an additional 19 articles to be manually added to the list the ultimate list of 54 articles was split into six categories with 7 articles focusing on cancer 11 on diabetes mellitus 7 on kidney issues 9 on stroke 12 on hypertension and 8 on high cholesterol diabetes is one of the most serious comorbidities linked to the severity of all three well-known human pathogenic coronavirus infections including sars-cov 2 patients with diabetes have an increased risk of severe complications including adult respiratory distress syndrome ards and multi-organ failure depending on the global region 20-50 of covid-19 pandemic patients had diabetes which emphasizes the importance of the link between covid-19 and diabetes 17  according to gupta r et al 1  individuals with diabetes are at risk of infections especially influenza and pneumonia patients with diabetes are severely affected when they contract respiratory viruses therefore diabetes was seen as an important risk factor for mortality in patients infected with pandemic influenza a 2009 h1n1 sars coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus merscov 18  19  20  several studies show that among the covid-19 patients there was also a noticeable percentage of patients suffering from diabetes mellitus dm yang x et al 21 found that among the 32 non-survivors from a group of 52 covid-19 patients median age of 597 6731 male 22 were diabetes patients additionally out of 1099 patients with confirmed covid-19 median age of 47 581 male from autonomous regions in china 173 had severe disease with comorbidities in which 162 were diabetes mellitus 22  zhang jj et al 23 analyzed data for 140 patients median age of 57 507 male who were admitted to hospitals in wuhan china with confirmed covid-19 cases 121 of these patients had diabetes 24 reviewed 258 confirmed covid-19 patients 63 with diabetes who were hospitalized at the west court of union hospital in wuhan china the patient median age was 64 and no significant difference was observed between males and females however as indicated by the authors patients with diabetes had significantly higher leukocyte and neutrophil counts as well as higher levels of fasting blood glucose serum creatinine urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme mb at admission compared to those without diabetes the cox proportional hazard model showed that diabetes adjusted hazard ratio ahr364 95 ci 109-1221 and fasting blood glucose ahr119 95 ci 108-131 were associated with the fatality of covid-19 adjusting for potential confounders the authors concluded that diabetes mellitus is associated with greater disease severity as well as a higher risk of mortality in patients with covid-19 and recommended that primary and secondary prevention strategies are needed for covid-19 patients with diabetes bloomgarden zt et al 25 stated that mortality rates from pneumonia among patients with diabetes in hong kong age  75 exceed mortality rates in this age group from cardiovascular disease and cancer 26  similar evidence of risk amid persons with diabetes has been reported for the two earlier cov infections sars in 2002 affecting more than 8000 individuals mainly in asia 27  28  and mers in 2012 affecting more than 2000 individuals mainly in saudi arabia 29  furthermore diabetes was present in 423 of 26 fatalities due to covid-19 in a study from wuhan china 30  huang c et al 31 investigated 41 hospital-admitted patients identified as having a laboratory-confirmed 2019-ncov infection most of the infected patients were men 73 the median age was 49 years and 20 had diabetes however these cases are only a small proportion of the patients affected a report of 72314 cases with 44672 confirmed covid-19 cases published by the chinese centre for disease control and prevention showed an increased mortality rate in people with diabetes 23 overall and 73 in patients with diabetes 32  bello-chavolla oy 33 predicted mortality due to sars-cov-2 and developed a mechanistic score 2 relating obesity and diabetes to covid-19 outcomes in data from mexico among 71103 subjects predominantly male the median age of 569 the authors observed 15529 subjects with sars-cov-2 and 1434 deaths from sars-cov-2 or other causes risk factors for lethality in covid-19 included early-onset diabetes obesity advanced age immunosuppression and ckd additionally it was observed that obesity mediates 455 of the effect of diabetes on covid-19 lethality the authors used stratified points according to categories of low risk 0 mild risk 1-3 141 moderate risks 4-6 high risk 7 8 9  and very high risk 10 the score of diabetes was 1 out of the 137 deaths from sars-cov-2 276 had diabetes a total of 174 patients median age of 59 437 male confirmed with covid-19 were studied by guo w et al 34  demographic data medical history symptoms signs laboratory findings chest computed tomographies ct as well as the treatment measures were collected and analyzed the authors found that 24 covid-19 patients with no other comorbidities except diabetes were at higher risk of severe pneumonia the release of tissue injuryrelated enzymes excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism the authors recommended that diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for rapid progression and poor prognosis of covid-19 extensive care should be administered to patients with diabetes in case of rapid deterioration the authors described a mortality rate of covid-19 amongst diabetic patients without other comorbidities of about 16 the above-mentioned studies are summarized in table 1  according to a few recently published results mainly chinese cohort patients with cancer are more vulnerable to covid-19 complications however how susceptible cancer patients are to infection with covid-19 has yet to be established liang w et al 6 collected and analyzed 2007 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions in china all cases were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 a total of 417 cases were excluded because of insufficient records of previous disease history the number of covid-19 cases with a history of cancer is 18 1 95 ci 061-165 out of 1590 covid-19 cases which according to 2015 cancer epidemiology statistics seems to be higher than the incidence of cancer in the overall chinese population 28583 029 per 100000 people lung cancer was the most frequent type five 28 of the 18 patients compared with patients without cancer patients with cancer were older mean age 631 years had no significant differences in sex other baseline symptoms other comorbidities or baseline severity of x-ray most importantly patients with cancer were observed to have a higher risk of severe events compared to patients without cancer seven 39 of 18 patients vs 124 8 of 1572 patients fishers exact p00003 the authors concluded that patients with cancer might have a higher risk of covid-19 than individuals without cancer additionally they showed that patients with cancer had poorer outcomes from covid-19 providing a timely reminder to physicians that cancer patients require intensive care while infected diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for rapid progression and poor prognosis of covid-19 na -not available  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

current covid-19 pandemic the authors included 28 cancer patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 from 3 designated hospitals in wuhan china from jan 2020 to 26 feb 2020 the median age of the patients was 65 607 were males and 25 had lung cancer the authors mentioned that cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the covid-19 infection in addition yu j et al 39 reviewed the medical records including demographic clinical and treatment data of 1524 patients with cancer who were admitted to zhongnan hospital of wuhan university china from dec 30 2019 to feb 17 2020 outcomes of covid-19 among patients with cancer were reported the authors estimated the infection rate of sars-cov-2 in patients with cancer from a single institution to be 079 12 of 1524 patients 95 ci 03-12 this was higher than the cumulative incidence of all diagnosed covid-19 cases that were reported in the city of wuhan over the same time 037 41 152 of 11 081 000 cases data cutoff on february 17 2020 the median age of infected patients was 66 years seven of 12 583 patients had non-small cell lung carcinoma nsclc five 417 were being treated with either chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy n  3 or radiotherapy n  2 three patients 250 developed sars and one patient required intensive-level care by march 10 2020 6 patients 500 were discharged whereas 3 deaths 250 were recorded of the 1524 patients with cancer who were screened 228 had nsclc the authors stated that patients with nsclc older than 60 years had a higher incidence of covid-19 than those aged 60 years or younger 43 vs 18 in table 2  we summarize the details of the three mentioned case studies  high blood pressure hypertension is one of the most common conditions in severe covid-19 patients 8  in this section we review several studies that looked at the relationship between hypertension and the severity of covid-19 the relationship between high blood pressure and increased risk of pneumonia was a subject of a study that analyzed uk biobank data of 107310 hypertension patients with 3 of patients developing pneumonia afterward 9  the data analysis shows that the risk of respiratory disease is significantly higher in patients with hypertension patients with hypertension were also found to be at higher risk of acute respiratory disease and chronic lower respiratory disease independent of age sex smoking status and bmi generalizing these results to covid-19 is plausible and led to many studies that focus on hypertension as a strong indication of covid-19 severity several recent studies have investigated the variability in covid-19 disease severity in patients with hypertension and its medicinal therapy in 40  the authors reported that among 3017 hospitalized covid-19 patients 53 were diagnosed with hypertension furthermore the mortality rates among patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors acei for hypertension treatment 27 p0001 as well as for patients on angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs 33 p012 were lower compared to other anti-hypertensive agents 39 therefore these results support the continuation of acei and arb therapy for covid-19 hypertensive patients these results are supported by another study 41  where 126 covid-19 patients with hypertension were retrospectively grouped into arbsaceis n43 and non-arbsaceis n83 according to their antihypertensive medications a group of covid-19 patients without hypertension were then randomly selected to match the previous group based on age and sex the results of this study show that the arbsaceis group had a lower proportion of critical patients 93 vs 229 p0061 and a lower death rate 47 vs 133 p0216 however these differences are not statistically significant similarly liu et al 42  investigated the disease severity in patients with hypertension who used acei arb ccb and beta-blockers bb compared to patients who did not take any hypertension medication considering only 46 elderly patients age  65 the results show that patients who took arb have a significantly lower risk of developing a severe disease compared to patients who took no drugs however although patients who took acei ccb and bb also had a lower risk of developing severe disease there was no statistical significance compared to patients who took no drugs this could be due to the limited number of patients on these drugs compared to arb in another study 43  the authors argued based on their retrospective investigation of different hypertension drugs that calcium channel blockers ccbs show significant efficacy on covid-19 patients they also conducted in vitro experiments to examine the efficacy of ccbs and other hypertension drugs on blocking sars-cov-2 replication in cells the results show that only ccbs block virus replication however the blocking mechanism is not apparent therefore further investigations of ccbs efficacy on post-entry virus replication in vitro and clinically are needed although the studies cited above show hypertension medications are beneficial for covid-19 patients a recent retrospective observational study 44 found that patients with hypertension who took aceiarb drugs have a higher risk of developing a severe case of covid-19 p  0064 however this is not a statistically significant difference and may be due to the limited number of patients with hypertension 75 out of 274 covid-19 patients also the group of patients with hypertension were older and had more comorbidities such as chronic renal insufficiency cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular disease than patients without hypertension interestingly another study 45 hypothesizes that hypertension treatment with acei and arbs which results in an upregulation of ace2 may increase the risk of developing severe covid-19 this is based on a structural study suggesting that sars-cov-2 uses ace2 as its receptor 46  it was also noted that ccb treatment of hypertension does not lead to an upregulation of ace2 which in turn makes it a safe treatment of hypertension in covid-19 patients however this theory is not supported by the previously cited retrospective studies on covid-19 patients  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 19 2020  who took acei and arbs 40  besides sanchis-gomar et al 47  noted that several health organizations have recommended the continued use of aceis and arbs for treating hypertension in covid-19 patients they also found based on their review study that there are no significant differences between aceis and arbs for managing hypertension with arbs being a more favorable option for severe cases of covid-19 we also reviewed several articles that employed systematic reviews and meta-analysis of published studies on the effects of hypertension on covid-19 disease severity in 48  systematic reviews show that hypertension is one of the major comorbidities of fatality covid-19 cases similarly zuin et al 49 carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis that show covid-19 patients with hypertension have a significantly higher mortality risk however it is noted that further studies of other comorbidities either linked or not linked to hypertension are needed also roncon et al 50 looked at the rate of icu admission of covid-19 patients with hypertension they found that among the 1382 patients mean age  515 years 5774 males patients with hypertension had a significantly increased risk of icu admission or254 95 ci 183 -354 p00001 the above-mentioned cases are summarized in table 3   cholesterol level alteration has been found to occur during a viral infection such as hiv and hepatitis c virus hcv 51  the mechanism of alteration involves the virus binding to the scavenger receptor b type 1 sr-b1 that facilitates the selective uptake of high-density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol and other lipid components of receptor-bound hdl particles including free cholesterol fc and triglycerides tg 52  also it has been found that membrane cholesterol is an important component to facilitate viral entry into host cells 53  the role of cholesterol in viral infection was investigated even before the current pandemic of sars-cov-2 ren et al 54  found that cholesterol depletion from the cellular membrane significantly impaired the efficiency of viral infection wei et al 52 studied the cholesterol metabolism of covid-19 patients compared to the normal reference population in general they found that fc hdl and ldl cholesterol level is significantly low for covid-19 patients compare to the reference population tg levels were also lower but not at a significant level moreover cholesterol metabolism of mild moderate severe and critical covid-19 patients was also presented and discussed the levels of hdl-c were significantly lower in patients with the severe and critical disease than in patients with moderate or mild disease in another study 55  hdl cholesterol levels along with serum albumin levels were used as predictors for the severity of covid-19 disease the study investigated the differences in clinical features between mild and severe covid-19 patients other features studied included hypoproteinemia hypoalbuminemia and decreased apoa1  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for

included it was also noted that patients with severe disease were significantly older median age 58 compared to patients with mild disease median age 37 their results show that patients with severe disease have significantly lower hdl cholesterol they also observed increased levels of albumin and hdl cholesterol in patients who were at the late stage of recovering from covid-19 another recent study 56  looked at the serum cholesterol level in patients with covid-19 in wenzhou china the laboratory test results show that patients had significantly low fc hdl-cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol levels compared to healthy control moreover they investigated the cholesterol levels in two categories of patients primary infection cases being those who had been in wuhan and secondary infection cases being those who had never been in wuhan but were infected by person-to-person transmission they reported that hdl-cholesterol in the primary infection group was significantly lower than in the secondary infection group similar to the results in 55  the cholesterol levels of fc hdl and ldl were improving as patients recovered the inverse correlation between hdl cholesterol level and severity of covid-19 is also highlighted in 57  the author argued that taking statin drug therapy for cholesterol may increase covid-19 infections statins are drugs used to lower cholesterol and protect against a heart attack and stroke taking statins results in very low or no production of endogenous cholesterol which leads to the upregulation of ldl in the cell membrane this as stated earlier is found to be an important component to facilitate viral entry into host cells overview of articles investigating cholesterol levels in covid-19 patients is summarized in table 4   apart from fever and respiratory complications acute kidney injury has been observed in some patients with covid-19 to investigate the possible cause of kidney damage in covid-19 patients lin w at al 58 used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data as well as an independent unpublished kidney single-cell rna-seq data generated in-house to evaluate ace2 gene expressions in all cell types of healthy kidneys and bladders the results showed the enriched expression of all subtypes of proximal tubule cells of the kidney and low but detectable levels of expression in bladder epithelial cells these results indicated the urinary system is a potential route for covid-19 infection along with the respiratory system and digestion system the findings suggested the  cc-by-nc 40 international license it

abnormalities of sars and covid-19 patients may be due to proximal tubule cell damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury beyond that laboratory tests of viruses and related indicators in urine may be needed in some special patients of covid-19 as for the novel coronavirus a recent study reported that the human kidney is a specific target for sars-cov-2 infection 59  the authors examined the viral nucleocapsid protein in situ in the kidney post-mortem and found that sars-cov-2 antigens accumulated in kidney tubules suggesting that sars-cov-2 infects the human kidney directly inducing aki and contributing to viral spreading in the body 60  alberici f et al 61 describe 20 kidney transplant recipients median age 59 years 80 male with sars-cov2 induced pneumonia all patients presented with fever but only one complained of difficulty in breathing overall 5 kidney transplant recipients died after a median period of 15 days from symptom onset these preliminary findings describe a rapid clinical deterioration associated with chest radiographic deterioration and escalating oxygen requirement in renal transplant recipients with sars-cov2 pneumonia thus in this limited cohort of long-term kidney transplant patients sars-cov-2 induced pneumonia is characterized by a high risk of progression and significant mortality wang j et al 62 conducted a study on one male patient age 49 with a history of close contact with a confirmed covid-19 case type 2 diabetes for 20 years and hypertension for 10 years the patient underwent comprehensive treatment for covid-19 organ transplant patients with covid-19 infection might have poorer prognosis because of their systemic immunosuppressive state however this severe case was cured even without discontinuing or reducing his immunosuppressant therapy this immunosuppressed case might help physicians to establish optimal treatment strategies for similar severe cases whether covid-19 causes significant acute kidney injury aki remains controversial zhou h et al 63 retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics urine and blood routine tests as well as other laboratory parameters of 178 hospitalized covid-19 patients in wuhan china no patient presented increased serum creatinine scr and 5 28 patients showed increased blood urea nitrogen bun indicating a few cases with kidney dysfunction however among the 83 466 patients with no history of kidney disease who received routine urine test upon hospitalization 45 542 patients displayed abnormality in urinalyses such as proteinuria hematuria and leukocyturia and none of the patients were recorded to have acute kidney injury aki throughout the study meanwhile the patients with abnormal urinalysis typically displayed worse disease progression that was reflected through laboratory parameter presentations including markers of liver injury inflammation and coagulation the authors concluded that urinalysis is better in unveiling potential kidney impairment of covid-19 patients than blood chemistry tests additionally urinalysis could be used to reflect and predict disease severity cheng y et al 64 determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury aki in patients with covid-19 and evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with covid-19 the authors studied a cohort of 701 patients median age of 63 5235 male with covid-19 in wuhan during 2020 of whom 113 161 died in hospitals during the study period aki occurred in 51 of patients kaplan-meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk of in-hospital death thus the authors believed that the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of aki during hospitalization in patients with covid-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality hence clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe covid-19 acute stroke remains a medical emergency even during the covid-19 pandemic avula a et al 65 investigated 4 patients with covid-19 that also presented acute stroke all 4 patients table 5  had

pneumonia ie increased stroke risk may not be true for sarscov-2 the main limitation of the remark however is certainly the short observation period of just 1 month oxley tj et al 72 reported 5 4 male 1 female large-vessel stroke patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 mean age is 404 all patients are younger than 50 years who presented in the health system of new york city severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection was diagnosed in all five patients although the patients were having covid-19 related symptoms such as fever cough and lethargy all of them had a reduced nih stroke scalescore nihss the studies reviewed in this paper have assessed the effects of diabetes cancer hypertension high cholesterol kidney issues and stroke on covid-19 severity through a thorough examination of the evidence provided in these reports inferences on the relationship between these preexisting conditions and covid-19 can be madeit is apparent that individuals with diabetes are at an increased risk for covid-19 infection and medical complications including death suggestions are made on the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and covid-19 and its management no definite conclusions can be made based on current limited evidence and data 1  further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted 2  furthermore the article by guo et al 3 has left several relevant questions to be addressed does the association between covid-19 and diabetes differ by different types of diabetes do antidiabetic drugs have an impact on disease progression is the impact of aging the same in diabetics as is in those without diabetes while the results of this study should be read in the light of some limitations such as the small sample size and the large age difference between study groups when patients with other comorbidities were excluded it still provides relevant insights that could inform about how covid-19 interacts with preexisting conditions 4  a few recently published reports provided results suggesting that cancer patients are susceptible to covid-19 complications in these studies lung cancer was most frequently observed and the covid-19 cases analyzed were all from hospitals in china however according to moujaess e et al 5  such reports could lead many oncologists to change their daily practice in cancer care without solid evidence and recommendations the data presented should be carefully interpreted not only because of the small sample but also because cancer patients in this cohort mentioned in 6 for instance had a significantly older median age than their control 631 vs 487 years as well as a more significant history of smoking suggesting that these two factors might be associated with the poor covid-19 outcomes than the cancer history itself moreover these results should be interpreted with caution in the absence of adjustment to the prevalence of the different comorbidities in the chinese population 5  also xia y et al 7 commented on the mentioned studies and highlighted reasons to be cautious suggesting that current evidence remains insufficient to explain a conclusive association between cancer and covid-19 though one effect that has risen concern is due to the number of covid-19 patients surpassing hospital and healthcare capacity cancer patients may be overlooked resulting in negative consequences in their treatments hypertension like diabetes has been proven to be linked to a significantly higher risk of respiratory infection making it a solid indicator of covid-19 severity additionally systematic reviews indicate hypertension to be common comorbidity in covid-19 death cases as well as be linked to significantly higher mortality risk and increased incidence of icu admission although it should be noted that further studies of other comorbidities connected to hypertension are necessary nonetheless it is evident that many patients with the virus also suffer from hypertension and as a result the comorbidity as well as its medicinal therapies on covid-19 have been observed it is also found that hypertension treatment should be continued to lower the severity risk some researchers recommended ccbs treatment and others found there are no significant differences in using aceis arbs or ccbs however there seems to be a general agreement with most health organizations who recommended hypertension treatment to be continued in covid-19 patients 47  cholesterol has previously been investigated concerning many viral infections typically there is a selective uptake of cholesterol as viruses bind to the cellular membrane which ultimately enables severe infection therefore analyses have been conducted on the connection between covid-19 and cholesterol most publications indicated that fc hdl and ldl cholesterol levels were significantly low in patients with a viral infection compared to the control these studies explained the ability of sars-cov-2 virus to use serum cholesterol for its entry into host cells therefore low serum cholesterol level can be used as an early predictor of covid-19 severity in patients also observing improvement in serum cholesterol levels may indicate the improvement of conditions in patients it is also worth noting that statin drugs for cholesterol may contribute to the severity of covid-19 disease by inhibiting endogenous cholesterol leading to the upregulation of ldl this leads to higher membrane cholesterol levels that enhance the ability of sars-cov-2 to enter host cells in addition to the multiple complications observed acute kidney injury has also been detected in covid-19 patients results indicated the urinary system respiratory system and digestion system as potential routes for the covid-19 infection one study indicating the human kidney to be a specific target of the virus findings propose kidney abnormalities in covid-19 patients may be due to proximal tubule cell damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury additionally in one study sars-cov-2 antigens were seen to accumulate in kidney tubules implying the direct impact on the kidney leading to aki induction and viral spread within the body there have also been studies describing a rapid clinical deterioration escalating oxygen requirement high risk of progression and significant mortality in kidney transplant patients similarly the incidence of kidney disease on admission as well as the development of aki is correlated with fatality in covid-19 patients however if covid-19 causes acute kidney injury remains uncertain many authors concluded that clinicians must still try to increase their awareness of kidney issues in patients with severe infection and a urinalysis may be used to predict the extent of disease severity one study identified 364 of covid patients to have neurological symptoms mainly in patients with severe disease and several mechanisms of covid-19 that increase stroke risk have been recognized but neither has been proven as significant further studies are required to investigate the neurological pathology during covid-19 infection additionally there may be a need to improve specific vte diagnostic strategies the safety of thromboprophylaxis and further identify the role il-6 plays in ischemic stroke however the risks associated with ischemic stroke in covid-19 patients are still uncertain as with cancer patients medical resources must be allocated to target the strain covid-19 has placed on ischemic stroke care meanwhile the relationship between covid-19 and stroke must be examined further  prevalence of comorbidities and its effects in patients infected with sars-cov-2 a systematic review and meta-analysis jing yang ya zheng xi gou ke pu zhaofeng chen qinghong guo rui ji haojia wang yuping wang yongning zhou   in december 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin has been reported in wuhan china only a few days later chinese health authorities confirmed that this cluster was associated with coronavirus hui et al 2020 and the disease caused by it was named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by who confirmed by comparative homology analysis covid-19 is closely associated with bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-like coronavirus bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 with 88 identity but is far away from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov about 79 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov about 50 lu et al 2020 a total of 77 658 confirmed cases including 9 162 with severe illnesses and 2 663 deaths had been reported as of february 25 2020 by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china huang et al firstly reported the clinical features of 41 confirmed patients and indicated 13 32 of them had underlying diseases huang et al 2020 including cardiovascular disease diabetes hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subsequently wang et al reported findings from 138 cases of covid-19 the results suggested that 64 464 of them had comorbidities importantly the patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit icu had a higher number of comorbidities 722 than those not admitted to the icu 373 this suggested that comorbidities maybe risk factors for adverse outcomes wang et al 2020 assessing the prevalence of these chronic diseases are the basis for mitigating complications in patients infected with sars-cov-2 however the effort was hampered by the limited number of cases to get more convincing results we will provide a systematic evaluation and detail which will not only estimate the prevalence of comorbidities in all patients but also assess the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients the results may aid in patient management while helping to develop policies for prevention and response to covid-19 and its critical outcomes a systematic search was conducted on studies published from january 1 2019 to february 25 2020 in pubmed embase and web of science databases records were managed by endnote x90 software to exclude duplicates according to the indices of the various databases we use the search term 2019 novel coronavirus and covid-19 and comorbidities clinical characteristics epidemiological without any language restriction to identify missing studies we checked the reference list for each selected paper eligible were those that described the epidemiological clinical features of covid-19 and the prevalence of chronic diseases in infected patients studies that were a duplicate publications b reviews editorials case reports letters and family-based studies or c only have childrens cases were excluded the steps of the literature search are shown in figure 1
 the two investigators j yang and yp wang who performed the literature search also independently extracted the data from included studies disagreements were resolved with a third investigator yn zhou or by consensus we extracted the following variables author date age gender number of participants in severe and non-severe and the prevalence of clinical symptoms such as fever cough fatigue and dyspnea together with comorbidities including hypertension diabetes respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease all calculations were performed by stata mp version 130 stata corporation college station tx usa the odds ratios ors was used to describe the risk of different comorbidities in severe patients compared with non-severe patients owing to heterogeneity within and between studies random-effect models were used to estimate the average effect and its precision which would give a more conservative estimate of the 95 confidence intervals cis the i2 statistic and cochrans q test were used to assess statistical heterogeneity search terms initially found a total of 108 articles after we removed duplicates checked the title and abstract and reviewed full-text eight studies remained for analysis but we found that the population in one of the eight studies overlapped with populations in others and it was not entirely in line with the purpose of our research so we excluded this article the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team 2020 seven studies guan et al 2020 huang et al 2020 k liu et al 2020 y liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 j zhang et al 2020 m zhang et al 2020 eventually met the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria as of february 25 2020 a total of 1 576 participants were included in our meta-analysis as presented in table 1
 the median age was 496 years and 890 565 were men the results of this meta-analysis showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever 913 95 ci 8697 followed by cough 677 95 ci 5976 fatigue 510 95 ci 3468 and dyspnea 304 95 ci 2140 however the i2 varying from 849 to 964 in the evaluates of the clinical features showed significant statistical heterogeneity p  0000 the comorbidities included hypertension diabetes respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease as shown in figure 2
inserts a b c d the most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension 211 95 ci 130272 and diabetes 97 95 ci 72122 followed by cardiovascular disease 84 95 ci 38138 and respiratory system disease 15 95 ci 0921 in analysis by the proportion of comorbidities significant heterogeneities were observed for estimates of hypertension and cardiovascular disease p  0000 but not for diabetes p  0209 and respiratory system disease p  0872 with i2 indexes ranging from 0 to 862 in figure 3
 we analyzed comorbidities between severe group and non-severe group higher risk of hypertension or 236 95 ci 146383 respiratory system disease or 246 95 ci 176344 and cardiovascular disease or 342 95 ci 188622 were observed in the severe group they showed low heterogeneity with i2 from 0 to 393  however there was not statistically significant difference in diabetes or 207 95 ci 089-482 the meta-analysis was based on data from 7 studies with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 all cases were from hospitals in china the results observed males took a larger amount than females statistics showed about 890686 in the covid-19 patients the results consisted with that the chinese center for disease control and prevention china cdc reported the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team 2020 mers-cov and sars-cov have also been found that males are more likely to be infected than females badawi and ryoo 2016 channappanavar et al 2017 it is customary to think women are less likely to be affected by many bacteria and viruses than are men partly because of their more robust innate and adaptive immune responses jaillon et al 2019 elderly people and severe patients are more susceptible to sars-cov-2 which may be associated with a higher frequency of comorbidities zhang et al 2020a a meta-analysis of the comorbidities suggested that hypertension was prevalent in approximately 211 of the patients diabetes cardiovascular disease and respiratory system disease were present in 97 84 and 15 of the cases respectively hypertension and diabetes mellitus consistent with the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in china were 232 hu et al 2019 and 109 liu et al 2019 in adults a recent study about influenza illness suggested that compared to patients with no comorbidities the risk of death for severe patients was higher in those who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or 149 95 ci 110201 and in those who had cardiovascular disease or 292 95 ci 176486 or hypertension or 149 95 ci 110210 mertz et al 2013 the comorbidities had also been noted to have similar effects in other respiratory illnesses such as mers badawi and ryoo 2016 in our study the associations were also observed in hypertension cardiovascular disease and respiratory system disease groups overall the severe patients were older wang et al 2020 and had more significant number of comorbid conditions than those who were non-severe these results may suggest that age and comorbidities are risk factors for critical patients diseases such as hypertension diabetes respiratory system disease cardiovascular disease and their susceptibility conditions may be linked to the pathogenesis of covid-19 chronic diseases share several standard features with infectious disorders such as the proinflammatory state and the attenuation of the innate immune response for instance diabetes occurs in part because the accumulation of activated innate immune cells in metabolic tissues leads to the release of inflammatory mediators especially il-1 and tnf which promote systemic insulin resistance and -cell damage odegaard and chawla 2012 additionally metabolic disorders may lead to low immune function by impairing macrophage and lymphocyte function dooley and chaisson 2009 which may make individuals more susceptible to disease complications badawi and ryoo 2016 recently guo et al 2019 retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of patients with viral pneumonia and found that the absolute count levels of cd3t cells cd3cd8 t cells and cd3cd4 t cells in the deceased group were significantly lower than those in the survival group suggesting that the levels of various inflammatory factors in the deceased group were higher than those in the survival group a prospective case control study about seasonal influenza was conducted by hong et al 2014 their results showed that diabetes and chronic cardiovascular disease were significantly related to development of complications and diabetes was an independent risk factor for severe seasonal influenza or 363 95 ci 1151151 p  002 furthermore a study analyzed the risk factors for patients with mers-cov infection finding diabetes smoking and heart disease were also significantly associated with mers-cov illness alraddadi et al 2016 limitations of this meta-analysis should be addressed first high heterogeneity statistics could be found this may relate to the study designs and large variation among studies in the sample size 9 to 1 099 patients second different lengths of follow-up may miss the events leading to heterogeneity some patients in the included studies are still in hospital third because only a few studies compared the comorbidities of severe and non-severe patients we did not conduct sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis if causality exists between chronic diseases and severe covid-19 patients it will help the health sector guide vulnerable populations and assess the risk of deterioration lau et al 2013 followed up the fiu vaccinations of 91 605 people with diabetes the results showed that the flu vaccine could decrease the incidence of influenza and pneumonia in people with diabetes aged 65 years by 43 and diabetes in elderly people 65 years by 55 the symptoms of covid-19 are similar to those of influenza e g fever cough or fatigue and the covid-19 outbreaks occured during a year of a high prevalence of respiratory diseases caused by influenza respiratory syncytial virus and other respiratory viruses vaccines can still be useful in preventing flu and will reduce possible confusion with the sars-cov-2 infection patel and jernigan 2020 the people with hypertension diabetes respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease should be included in influenza and future sars-cov-2 vaccination recommendations given the limited level of evidence more adequately powered studies should be conducted to prove the association the prevalence of chronic diseases is increasing year by year and targeted public health vaccination interventions must be adopted to better protect people with chronic diseases from infection with sars-cov-2 and other respiratory viruses the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work the study does not require ethical approval because the meta-analysis is based on published research and the original data are anonymous  comorbidities in covid-19 outcomes in hypertensive cohort and controversies with renin angiotensin system blockers awadhesh singh kumar ritesh gupta anoop misra   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has been declared as a pandemic by word health organization on march 11 2020 as soon as it satisfied the epidemiological criteria infection in more than 100000 people in 100 countries 1 as of march 27 2020 world has witnessed more than half a million cases of covid-19 with more than 24000 deaths 2 this suggests the magnitude of its spread across the world since it was first reported on december 31 2019 from wuhan hubei province in china emerging data suggests that older covid-19 patients with other comorbid conditions such as diabetes hypertension cardiac and pulmonary disease are in particular more susceptible compared to general populations and have higher mortality therefore it is necessary to re-look into these subgroups of covid-19 patients with associated co-morbidities in this review article we have collated all the available evidence that has emerged so far on outcomes and comorbidities in patients with covid-19 here we have focused on outcomes in patients of covid-19 with hypertension and analyzed the controversies surrounding the use of renin-angiotensin system blockers rasb we have systematically searched the pubmed medical database up till march 27 2020 using mesh key words that include covid-19 coronavirus hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease angiotensin receptor blockers angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors we have retrieved all the available literature published in english language on covid-19 that reported the outcomes in different co-morbidities the association of hypertension and diabetes in patients with covid-19 is not unexpected given the rising prevalence of both of these chronic diseases globally interestingly in the pooled data from the ten chinese studies n  2209 that have reported the characteristics of comorbidities in patients with covid-19 associations of hypertension diabetes and presence of established cardiovascular disease cvd are larger varying from 15 to 30 average 21 520 average 11 and 240 average 7 respectively table 1
 established cvd was also present in nearly 43 in italian study of 355 patients with covid-19 table summarizes the prevalence of these comorbidities in all available studies to-date in patients with covid-19 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 while consistent association of hypertension in patients with covid-19 across all these studies is unique the concern which needs a serious attention is the increase in mortality two chinese studies have worked in this direction to-date in 191 patients with covid-19 zhou et al found hypertension to have an odds ratio or of 305 95 ci 157 to 592 p  0006 diabetes with or of 285 95 ci 135 to 605 p  0001 whereas presence of coronary artery disease had an or of 2140 95 ci 464 to 9876 p  00001 for in-hospital mortality in an univariate analysis 8 however the association between these disorders and covid-19 mortality were no longer significant after a multivariate regression analysis similarly in an analysis of 201 patients with covid-19 wu et al found hypertension to have a hazard ratio hr of 182 95 ci 113 to 295 p  001 for acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and 170 95 ci 092 to 314 p  009 for death the diabetic patients had a hr of 234 95 ci 135 to 405 p  0002 for ards and hr of 158 95 ci 080 to 313 p  019 for death in a bivariate cox regression analysis 11 it should be noted however that neither of these studies were adjusted for all confounding variables nevertheless a study of 187 patients with covid-19 guo et al reported nearly a twice increase in mortality in patients with established cvd and raised troponin t tnt compared to patients without cvd and raised tnt 694 vs 375 respectively 14 the chinese center for disease control and prevention in a summary report of covid-19 reported a case fatality rate cfr of 23 1023 deaths among 44672 confirmed cases however cfr was elevated to 60 for hypertension 73 for diabetes and 105 for presence of cvd 15 unsurprisingly based on the above findings researchers have recently proposed that the course of treatment and prognosis of covid-19 should be stratified based on the absence or presence of co-morbidities in to type a b and c type a denotes covid-19 patients with pneumonia but without comorbidities type b denotes covid-19 pneumonia and comorbidities whereas type c denotes covid-19 patients with multi-organ dysfunction 16 nonetheless it still remains unclear whether these increased association of hypertension with covid-19 and heightened risk of mortality is directly related to hypertension or other associated comorbidities or anti-hypertensive treatment there has been a growing concern that this association with hypertension and or cvd may be confounded by the treatment with certain antihypertensive medications such as rasb although a recent paper has proposed to stop rasb and suggested to replace it with the calcium channel blocker while treating hypertension in patients with covid-19 17 this hypothesis has been questioned by several other colleagues 18 19 20 21 22 the entry of coronavirus into the cell is facilitated by the spike s protein before attachment to the receptor on host cell the s protein needs to be primed by a serine protease named tmprss2 the s proteins of different coronaviruses may utilise different receptors mers utilises cd26 while sars cov and sars cov2 utilise angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 23 the efficiency of the interaction between s-protein and ace-2 may be a key determinant of the transmissibility of the virus viral replication and the severity of disease in theory this efficiency could be influenced by changes or amino acid substitutions in either the viral s-protein or the ace-2 receptor on host cella
changes in s-protein molecular studies and the elucidation of the atomic and crystal structure of ace-2s protein interface of sars cov have provided important insights 24 the major outbreak of sars cov occurred in 20022003 with a minor localised outbreak with mild symptoms in 20032004 it was observed that the s-protein of sars cov in the 20022003 outbreak bound to ace-2 receptor much more efficiently than that of sars cov in the 20032004 outbreak consistent with the absence of human-to-human transmission during the latter outbreak several molecular changes in the s-protein influence the binding with human ace-2 for example the substitution of threonine by serine at position 487 in s protein reduces the binding 25 similarly asparagine at position 479 increased the binding affinity 26 methylation at position 487 has also been shown to influence binding recently s-protein of sars cov2 has been shown to be similar to that of sars cov barring a few gains of function mutations the most important of these is a glutamine at position 493 at the receptor binding domain which explains its increased transmissibility compared to sars cov 27b
changes in ace-2 receptor with regard to mers-cov which employs cd26 dpp-4 as its receptor for cellular entry there are naturally-occurring polymorphisms in dpp4 that impact cellular entry of mers-cov and might thus modulate mers development in infected patients 28 there is a possibility that similar variations or polymorphisms in ace-2 could affect the viral entry and disease course polymorphisms of ace-2 gene have been identified however there is no evidence that they affect susceptibility to or severity of sars cov2 infection 29 a recent study found differential ace-2 gene expression in human lung tissue with no racialgender differences but a higher gene expression in lungs of smokers compared to non-smokers which could explain the higher risk of infection in smokers 30
 the role of ace-2 on vascular bed is opposite to that of angiotensin converting enzyme ace ace converts angiotensin i to angiotensin ii which is a vasoconstrictor ace-2 converts angiotensin ii to angiotensin 17 which causes vasodilatation after binding to the mas receptor in the vascular bed 31 downregulation of ace-2 was observed in animal models of lung injury induced by sars cov 32 recombinant ace-2 improved pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation in animals with lung injury indicating that ace-2 may be the main determinant of lung injury caused by sars cov 33 however there is lack of human data except a small study in 10 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome which showed that recombinant ace-2 was well tolerated and led to an increase in angiotensin 17 34 there has been considerable interest regarding the role of ras blockers in covid-19 infection both benefit and harm have been postulated figure 1 illustrates the interactions between the effect of rasb and covid-19 fig 1
a
rationale and evidence for harm there is evidence that ace-2 expression increases with the use of ace inhibitors and arb especially in heart and kidney 3536 this has raised a theoretical concern that by increasing ace-2 expression aceis and arbs could facilitate the entry of virus into the host cell and increase the chances of infection or its severity 17 also there is increased ace-2 expression in elderly 37 to what extent this predisposes the elderly to infection with sarscov2 is not known in a study of 187 patients with covid-19 guo et al reported an increased trend in mortality with those receiving rasb compared to those not receiving mortality was 368 6 of 19 and 256 43 of 168 in patients with or without rasb respectively 14 indeed increased association and heightened mortality with covid-19 have been observed consistently across the studies in elderly hypertensive diabetics and known cvd however it is not exactly known whether it has any causal relation with the use of rasb or these subgroups are more on rasb due to these illness compared to the rest of population moreover there is no solid evidence to back this concern either in covid-19 or in infection by other coronavirusesb
rationale and evidence for benefit as discussed above increasing ace-2 levels in coronavirus infection could reduce lung injury in an experimental study with mice kuba et al found that losartan showed significantly diminished lung injury and pulmonary edema after acid aspiration-induced acute lung injury with addition of sars-cov spike protein compared to placebo 32 similarly severe lung injury and pulmonary edema were prevented by both recombinant human ace-2 infusions or losartan in ace2-knockout mice 38 mice with coronavirus induced lung injury showed improvement when treated with losartan 39 moreover a retrospective analysis found reduced rates of death and endotracheal intubation in patients with viral pneumonia who were continued on ace inhibitors 40 treatment with arbs was reported to reduce mortality in ebola virus infection 41 the exact mechanism of apparent benefit of these drugs in coronavirus infection is not yet clear however there could be several explanations 42iincreased ace-2 expression may not result in more viral entry into the cell because of the limited availability of the serine protease tmprss2 camostat mesylate which is a tmprss2 inhibitor has been shown to inhibit cellular entry of sars cov2 and could be a potential therapeutic option 43iiincreased ace-2 expression on the cell membrane may also lead to increased soluble ace-2 in blood which may actually bind to most of sars cov2 and prevent its interaction with the membrane bound receptoriiiras blockers increase angiotensin ii which is a substrate for ace-2 the interaction of ace-2 with angiotensin ii could induce a conformational change in the receptor binding domain of ace-2 limiting its ability to bind with sars cov2 44ivace-2 receptors are present at a much higher density in lung tissue of children and young adults compared to older individuals thus the upregulation of ace-2 receptors by the use of rasb over time in older people may emulate ace expression in young people it is also possible that having more ace-2 receptors and increased ace-2 functions will likely produce more angiotensin 17 that might provide resilience against target-mediated destruction and development of pulmonary failure in patients with covid-19 22 this postulated positive effects on lung can be also protective during overwhelming infection with covid-19vindiscriminate discontinuation of rasb in patients with heart failure may also lead to readmission to hospital and increase in mortality 45
 collectively relationship between ras activity and use of rasb in sars cov2 infection is very scarce the only indirect evidence of ras activation in covid-19 is high incidence of hypokalaemia 46 with regards to the use of rasb a retrospective analysis of 112 covid-19 hospitalised patients with cardiovascular disease in wuhan there was no significant difference in the proportion of aceiarb medication between non-survivors and survivors 47 however a study of 187 patient reported by guo et al there was a trend of increase in mortality in patients with covid-19 receiving rasb 368 compared to those not receiving 256 14 covid-19 is increasingly associated with comorbidities that include hypertension and diabetes special care is required in patients with covid-19 with associated comorbidities given the heightened risk of in-hospital death in view of lack of robust evidence for either benefit or harm and with bulk of the experimental evidence in favour of benefit it is reasonable for patients to continue using ace inhibitors and arb as recommended by the european society of cardiology hypertension canada the canadian cardiovascular society uk renal association the international society of hypertension and european society of hypertension and american heart association 48 49 50 future studies reporting the outcome stratified on the basis of different anti-hypertensive agents in covid-19 may further enlighten us in this regard we hereby declare that we have no conflict of interest related to this article  covid-19 hypertension and cardiovascular diseases should we change the therapy marijana tadic cesare cuspidi giuseppe mancia raffaella delloro guido grassi   the prevalence of hypertension ranged from 45 in non-critically ill patients to 30 in older patients with covid-19 whereas the prevalence of cvd was significantly lower and varied from 1 to 18 table 1
 it is expected that the prevalence was significantly higher in older patients and those with other comorbidities such as diabetes and kidney impairment one should notice that different studies used various definitions of cvd some included coronary heart disease and heart failure whereas others also included cerebrovascular disease therefore one should be cautious in the interpretation of these results meta-analyses confirmed considerable prevalence of hypertension and cvd among patients with covid-19 20 21 22 23 24 table 2
 this indicated the importance of hypertension and cvd in covid-19 patients and raised the question about susceptibility of cvd and hypertensive patients to sars-cov-2 nevertheless other risk factors such as smoking and obesity should not be underestimated and in most studies the effect of obesity is not possible to be estimated due to the lack of data a limited number of studies provided follow-up data which is the consequence of rapid publication and large interest of healthcare professionals around the world in all information regarding covid-19 table 3
 most of these investigations confirmed a significantly higher percentage of hypertension and cvd among patients with the adverse outcome however only few studies performed an adequate multivariate analysis including several risk factors with the adjustment for possible confounding factors guan et al included 1590 patients and reported that those with hypertension diabetes copd and malignancy were more likely to reach the composite endpoints admission to intensive care unit or invasive ventilation or death after adjusting for age and smoking status 5 patients with 2 comorbidities had a significantly increased risk of the adverse outcome in a small study by wu et al hypertension and diabetes were predictors of the acute respiratory distress syndrome ards but not the lethal outcome in covid-19 patients 12 a recently published study that involved 1012 patients with covid-19 demonstrated that cvd but not hypertension was more prevalent in patients with aggravation of disease comparing with those who did not experience deterioration of covid-19 7 however the analysis of the predictors of disease deterioration was not performed another investigation revealed that the incidence of all comorbidities was higher in the covid-19 patients with a severe and critical clinical course than in the patients with a moderately severe clinical course 9 chen et al reported that hypertension cvd and diabetes were more prevalent among the covid-19 patients with the lethal outcome comparing to the survivors 11 table 3 however there was a large difference in age and sex distribution between the groups and the authors did not investigate the effect of comorbidities on the outcome in this population 11 zhou et al reported that hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease chronic renal disease and copd were more frequent among non-survivors than survivors 15 the authors found that hypertension diabetes and coronary heart disease were predictors of mortality in covid-19 patients nevertheless after adjustment for age none of these comorbidities remained significant predictors of mortality ace2 has gained a widespread interest as the cellular receptor of sars-cov-2 cause of the covid-19 pandemic ace2 is a master regulator of raas and both reduced or increased function of ace2 can induce systemic and pulmonary hypertension heart failure myocardial infarction and diabetic cardiovascular complications 30 ace2 is highly expressed in the heart lungs kidney and gastrointestinal tract and it plays an important role in several cardiovascular and immune pathways the binding affinity of the novel coronavirus with ace2 appears to be stronger than the virus that causes sars which may explain the significantly higher global influence of covid-19 than the initial sars potential therapeutic strategies may include preventing the binding of human ace2 and sars-cov-2 in the post-mortem autopsy of the heart tissues from the patients with sars about 30 had a detectable viral sars-cov genome and their myocardium was characterized by increased myocardial fibrosis inflammation and reduced myocardial ace2 expression 3132 these patients had a much more aggressive disease associated with earlier mortality these data are still not available in covid-19 patients but the studies that investigated cardiac injury by elevation of cardiac enzymes showed that the prevalence of cardiac injury is frequent and more prevalent among patients with the lethal outcome 1013 chen et al recently revealed that human cardiac pericytes have high expression of ace2 which could be the target cell of sars-cov-2 33 the virus-induced pericytes damage can provoke capillary endothelial cells dysfunction and further microvascular dysfunction patients with heart failure disease at baseline demonstrated elevated ace2 expression at both mrna and protein levels which further increases the risk of heart attack and the critically ill condition in patients infected by this coronavirus 33 the biological effects of ace2 are focused on the formation of angiotensin-17 from angiotensin ii ace2 unlike ace does not convert angiotensin i to angiotensin ii nor do ace inhibitors block its activity which is crucial for understanding of its biological properties and the effect of raas inhibitors the influence of raas inhibitors on ace2 activity and expression is known from animal and human studies the large confusion and panic regarding usage of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors acei and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arb erupted for two reasons i confusion between ace and ace2 inhibitors and ii some studies reported a significantly higher percentage of raas inhibitors usage among covid-19 patients with the lethal outcome ace and ace2 are two different enzymes with two different active sites and any effect of acei on ace2 activity must therefore be an indirect one through their corresponding substrates sars-cov-2 binding is unlikely to have any relationship with ace or acei nevertheless there are limited data that aceis affect the expression of ace2 in the heart and the kidney 34 on the other hand there is more evidence that arbs modify ace2 expression 3536 upregulation has been primarily found in the cardiac tissue and in the renal vasculature however the results are inconsistent require high arbs dosages and vary according to arb and the organ additionally most investigations measured blood ace2 activity that reveals the soluble ace2 protein circulating at very low levels which is not the same as membrane-bound ace2 if arbs upregulated membrane-bound ace2 it is reasonable to hypothesize that this would be the consequence of at1 receptor blockade aceis would have a similar effect as arbs even though there are only limited data about acei-induced upregulation of ace2 however the currently available data are mostly obtained in animal studies and could not be directly applied to humans therefore there is no sufficient evidence that arbs or aceis could facilitate sars-cov-2 entry and cause covid-19 in the recent state-of-art review sanchis-gomar et al suggested that arbs might be a better treatment option in covid-19 patients at higher risk of severe forms of disease due to the equal efficacy but fewer side effects than aceis 37 nevertheless the existing studies that included a large number of patients did not give advantage to any group of medications within raas inhibitors feng et al investigated 476 patients with covid-19 and reported a significantly higher usage of arbs in hypertensive patients with moderate covid-19 disease than those with a severe and critical course of disease 9 there was no difference in usage of aceis between covid-19 patients with different severity of disease there are no data regarding the association between raas inhibitors and the outcome however the investigators studied the use of raas inhibitors only in hypertensive patients but not in the patients with other indications for acei and arb heart failure diabetes renal impairment moreover the number of patients who were taking aceis and arbs was very low 7 and 24 respectively 9 interestingly the percentage of arbs was significantly higher than aceis guo et al included only 187 patients with covid-19 and their use of raas inhibitors was significantly higher in the patients with detected cardiac injury than in the patients without this injury 211 vs 59 13 underlying diseases such as hypertension coronary artery disease cardiomyopathy and chronic renal disease were also significantly more prevalent in the patients with cardiac injury 13 these comorbidities may have largely contributed to cardiac injury in these patients but these diseases are also the reason for taking raas inhibitors this explains the higher prevalence of raas inhibitors in covid-19 patients with cardiac injury defined by the elevated serum level of troponin there was a great confusion in the social media and among healthcare professionals after these preliminary studies due to uncertainties whether aceis and arbs should be switched to another antihypertensive medications several large studies therefore concentrated on the effect of aceiarb on morbidity and mortality in covid-19 patients and they obtained encouraging results li et al included 1178 patients with covid-19 out of which 362 had hypertension and reported that aceisarbs are not associated with the severity or mortality of covid-19 patients 38 a recent large study from italy that involved 6272 patients with covid-19 and 30759 non-covid patients showed that the use of aceis and arbs was more frequent among the covid-19 patients than in the control group due to the higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease 39 nevertheless there was no association between aceiarb use and the risk of covid-19 39 an american study that included 5894 patients with covid-19 found no association between any single medication class including raas inhibitors and the positive test for covid-19 40 mehra et al involved 8910 patients with covid-19 from 169 hospitals in asia europe and north america and revealed no association between the use of aceiarb and the increased in-hospital mortality 41 a study that investigated covid-19 patients with hypertension treated with raas inhibitors showed that the patients receiving acei or arb therapy had a lower rate of severe diseases and a trend toward a lower level of il-6 in peripheral blood 29 moreover acei or arb treatment increased the level of cd3 and cd8 t cell in peripheral blood and reduced the peak viral load compared to other antihypertensive drugs these findings were the first evidence which supports the benefit of aceis or arbs in covid-19 patients with hypertension because they can potentially improve clinical outcomes in these patients the authors hypothesized that raas inhibitors did not directly inhibit the viral replication but had an indirect antiviral role by regulation of the immune function and inhibition of the inflammatory response nevertheless the potential mechanisms need to be clarified in the future large human studies a large study that included 1128 hypertensive patients with covid-19 showed that inpatient use of aceiarb after adjustment for age gender and comorbidities was related with lower all-cause mortality compared with aceiarb non-users 42 further analysis revealed that the use of raas inhibitors was also associated with reduced mortality in covid-19 patients with hypertension in comparison to the use of other antihypertensive drugs 42 raas inhibitors have an important role in the treatment of heart failure and renal impairment particularly with albuminuria not only in hypertension withdrawing these medications or switching therapy would have uncertain benefits but definitely many disadvantages such as uncontrolled hypertension cardiac decompensation and renal function impairment which could potentially induce more complications in patients with covid-19 than the infection of sars-cov-2 itself this is why several specialty societies recommended that covid-19 patients continue therapy with raas inhibitors 43 44 45 46 this is in agreement with the latest studies that did not find any association between raas inhibitors and increased morbidity andor mortality in the covid-19 patients it is important to discuss evident limitations of the available data one of the most important limitations is the self-reporting of comorbidities on hospital admission which can cause significant underestimation of comorbidities because of the lack of awareness andor the lack of diagnostic testing the follow-up period was short and some patients remained in hospital when the data were being analyzed meaning that the actual outcome is unknown which can interfere with the published results obesity was not reported in any of these studies and the influence of bmi could not be investigated or included in the adjustment which would be of great importance the data about the therapy at baseline and during the therapy are poor which is an important potentially confounding factor in evaluation of hypertension and cvd as independent predictors of susceptibility to sars-cov-2 or the outcome of covid-19 the investigations that reported negative association between raas inhibitors and covid-19 included only a limited number of covid-19 patients which is an additional limitation for reaching statistical significance the prevalence of hypertension and cvd is clinically relevant in patients with covid-19 and particularly in the elderly the impact of hypertension and cvd on the outcome is still uncertain there are some concerns that raas inhibitors particularly arbs can affect the expression of ace2 based on animal models however there is no clinical evidence that raas inhibitors should be restricted or temporarily discontinued in covid-19 patients large longitudinal studies with the comprehensive analysis of all cv risk factors and possible confounders as well as the evaluation of the treatment on progression and the prognosis of covid-19 are warranted 4445 the paper covid-19 and cardiovascular diseases should we change therapy has not been submitted elsewhere it is not under review or published previously there is no possible conflict of interest  sars-cov-2 covid 19 infection in hypertensive patients and in patients with cardiac disease alexander muacevic john adler r ivan cancarevic bilal malik haider   the sars-cov-2 virus a newly discovered member of the coronavirus family was first described at the end of 2019 in wuhan china as the third severe respiratory syndrome caused by a coronavirus 1 due to its easy spread via droplets and direct contact it quickly spread globally leading the world health organization to declare it a public health emergency 2 most countries around the world are taking measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus as the main mechanism of fighting the disease 2 some of those measures have had a significant impact on peoples lives many countries have imposed travel restrictions 3-4 leaving millions of people having to change travel plans the psychological and economic impact of mandatory isolation following possible exposure to the virus is another matter of concern 5-7 clinically the disease presents after an incubation period of between 2 and 14 days 8 the cdc reports that the most common symptoms are fever cough and shortness of breath while dyspnea chest pain confusion and cyanosis represent alarm symptoms that should prompt people to seek medical attention 8 the largest meta-analysis available at the time of writing this article reports that fever and cough are the presenting symptoms in 89 and 72 of patients respectively 9 fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequently reported 10 hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most commonly reported comorbidities 10-12 older individuals and those with comorbidities were more likely to develop end-organ damage requiring icu admission 11 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards acute kidney injury aki and cardiac injury were all reported in severe cases with ards being the most common 11 leukopenia and less commonly eosinopenia were the most typical laboratory findings while bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacities in the lungs were the most common radiologic abnormalities 10-12 c-reactive protein d-dimer and procalcitonin levels were elevated especially in cases of severe disease 12 
at the time of this writing no clear guidelines on treating sars-cov-2 infections have been published and most clinicians seem to be treating them in a manner similar to that of seasonal flu the purpose of this article is to look at the impact the sars-cov-2 infection is having on hypertensive patients considering the extremely high prevalence of hypertension in society and the fact that hypertension is among the most frequent comorbidities of patients with severe cases of sars-cov-2 infections we believe it is important to look more deeply into the relationship between the two conditions the role of angiotensin converting enzyme the angiotensin converting enzyme ace enzyme is an essential component of human metabolism and its dysregulation is associated with a number of different clinical conditions including hypertension many studies were done to assess the potential role of ace in ards development multiple animal models have shown a protective effect of ace ii against ards development 13-15 sars-cov-2 similarly to sars-cov uses the ace ii receptor to invade the alveolar epithelium and can be considered a potential target for future anti-covid-19 therapies 13 16 cardiovascular pathology and ace inhibitorsangiotensin receptor ar blockers lead to increased ace ii levels potentially increasing the risk of sars-cov-2 infections as pointed out by hanff et al 17 there is also some evidence that sars-cov-2 can lead to the downregulation of ace ii and toxic accumulation of angiotensin ii 17 it should also be noted that ace ii is expressed in other organs and tissues as well the fact that ace is expressed in the gut heart and kidney and that sars-cov infections can be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and the virus can often be isolated from the stool cardiac damage and aki speaks in favor of there being a strong correlation between ace expression and covid infection 18 overall the exact role of ace enzyme and angiotensin in lung injury in general as well as in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 covid 19 infections is not clear if the models are true and ace ii does have a protective role against ards and ards is the feared complication of covid 19 it would be reasonable to assume ace ii would have a protective effect against covid 19 as the ace ii receptor is used by the virus to infect the alveolar epithelium it raises the issue of whether the availability of the receptor is associated with the severity of clinical findings moreover a large percentage of the population is treated with ace inhibitors and arbs whether those treatments are associated with a change in outcomes of covid 19 infections is currently debated while we recognize the difficulties of performing basic science research especially on animal models in light of the current epidemic we agree with hanff et al and would strongly encourage scientists to keep researching the possible connection between ace receptor angiotensin and ards ace inhibitorsar blockers the ace inhibitors and ar blockers are currently among the most frequently prescribed medications in the western world they are most commonly used in patients suffering from hypertension congestive heart failure and proteinuria most commonly due to diabetes mellitus they act by reducing the activity of the renin-angiotensin system ras if the ras plays a significant role in sars-cov-19 pathogenesis and ards development it would be reasonable to assume that patients treated with ace inhibitorsar blockers would be impacted the animal models suggest that the administration of ace inhibitors and ar blockers leads to an elevated number of ace ii receptors in the pulmonary circulation 19
marin reported that many patients from latin america and spain were intending to discontinue taking their ace inhibitorsar blockers due to fear of the infection 20 despite some animal models showing a potential association between ace inhibition and worsening lung injuries due to sars-cov there has been no clinical evidence to support such an association 21 the european society of cardiology recommends not discontinuing either of the drugs as the potential risks associated with uncontrolled hypertension seem to outweigh the risks of ace inhibition worsening the covid 19 infection 22 danser et al reached the same conclusion 23 french health minister claimed that the use of anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen could worsen covid 19 symptoms 24 although ace ii levels can be increased by the use of nsaids the evidence for an association with the severity of covid 19 symptoms is weak 25 fang et al do however recommend monitoring patients who are taking any of the controversial drugs and when possible choosing alternative treatments 25 despite that most health authorities including the nhs suggest using paracetamolacetaminophen instead as a precautionary measure 26 the overall impact of ace inhibition on sars-cov-19 covid 19 pathogenesis is at this point of time difficult to establish the belief that an association between the two exists is mostly based on animal models while the clinical evidence for such association is lacking despite the lack of clinical evidence it appears to be the case that a number of patients plan on discontinuing their long-term therapies believing that this would decrease their risk of contracting andor dying from covid 19 the evidence for a relationship between nsaid use and more severe sars-cov-19 infections is also weak although a possible pathophysiologic link can be hypothesized in this case however many health authorities recommend against using nsaids until further evidence comes to light we believe that a lot more basic science research into the pathophysiology of both coronavirus infections and ards development in general is needed before clearer patterns emerge at this point it may be reasonable to avoid starting new patients on nsaids and ace inhibitorsarbs if it can be avoided when it comes to patients who require those treatments for other conditions discontinuation of them is unlikely to benefit patients as the evidence for exacerbations of their comorbidities is stronger than the evidence for the covid 19 disease severity hypertension and covid 19 there have been news reports and expert opinions on patients with hypertension presenting with more severe cases of covid 19 moreover hypertension was among the most frequently reported comorbidities of those patients 10-12 it should be taken into account however that hypertension is among the most prevalent chronic conditions in the western world affecting millions of people fang et al point out that the association between diabetes and hypertension and covid 19 infections is likely due to their association with ace ii enzyme 25 li et al reported a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities among covid 19 patients treated in the icu compared to those who did not require icu treatment 27 they also reported that over 8 of those infected by sars-cov-2 developed cardiac injury 27 chen et al have also reported a similar association 28 the elevated troponin levels seen in icu patients also pointed towards the development of myocardial injury 28 the odds ratio of developing a severe case compared to a nonsevere case for hypertensive patients was 236 with a 95 confidence interval between 146 and 383 29 none of the studies analyzed age as a potential confounder considering that the prevalence of hypertension rises with age and older patients are in general more likely to suffer serious complications of infectious diseases that was addressed by the international society of hypertension who point out that there is no evidence that patients with hypertension are overrepresented among those with severe sars-cov-2 infections when adjusted for age 30 it is difficult to assess the impact hypertension has on the outcome of patients infected by sars-cov-2 multiple studies point to a significant association between hypertension and adverse outcomes however the number of potential confounders the main of which is age is vast the previously mentioned association between antihypertensives and severe covid 19 presentations also needs to be taken into account the number of studies that have been published so far is insufficient to properly address all those questions we hope that as more case reports and review articles become available in the literature a clearer pattern will emerge the outcomes of patients with uncontrolled hypertension should be compared to those of normotensive controls of similar baseline characteristics the outcomes of hypertensive patients managed with ace inhibitorsar blockers should be compared to those of hypertensive patients managed with calcium channel antagonists coronary artery disease congestive heart failure and covid 19 besides hypertension other cardiovascular comorbidities were also frequently reported in patients with severe cases of covid 19 considering the significant associations between hypertension and cardiac disease a correlation would be expected moreover there is a significant association between heart failure and pulmonary disease particularly pulmonary hypertension the possible consequences of even mild cardiac damage would be expected to be more significant among patients with pre-existing cardiac disease as li et al reported the cardio-cerebrovascular disease was among the most prevalent comorbidities among patients with severe cases of covid 19 second only to hypertension 171 and 164 respectively 27 zhou et al reported that coronary disease was the third most prevalent comorbidity after hypertension and diabetes 31 chen et al also found that previous history of coronary disease was an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes 28 the proposed mechanism of such findings is that pericytes with high ace ii expression might be the cells targeted by sars-cov-2 32 pericyte injury could then lead to endothelial dysfunction 32 patients with pre-existing heart failure are more likely to have elevated ace ii expression due to the pathophysiology of chf which could then increase the risk of infection 32 he et al found the mortality of critically ill patients infected by sars-cov-2 who develop cardiac injury to be as high as 60 33 they also found an elevation in n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide levels usually a biomarker for congestive heart failure associated with the myocardial injury caused by covid 19 considered together these studies point to an association between pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities and adverse outcomes following sars-cov-2 infections the most likely contributing factor to such finding is the observed myocardial damage in a subset of covid 19 patients which patients with pre-existing heart disease are less likely to recover from moreover the increased expression of ace ii with congestive heart failure could explain the increased susceptibility to the virus the ability to address myocardial damage in the icu may prove to be the most important prognostic factor for those patients considering the lack of currently approved treatments aimed at the virus itself it is especially important to ensure that people with such comorbidities are not exposed to it in the first place more research is needed into the exact impact of sars-cov-2 on the cardiovascular system in order to develop both protective and potentially curative strategies covid 19 caused by sars-cov-19 has been the most talked-about disease of the first half of 2020 the elderly and those suffering from chronic conditions are most at risk for adverse outcomes hypertension was the most frequently reported comorbidity among patients with severe infections followed by diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases possibly related to their expression of ace ii facilitating viral entry into cells the relationship between ace inhibitorar blocker use and the incidence of severe covid-19 has been conflicting and at present where most authorities do not recommend discontinuing long-term ace inhibitorar blocker treatments a concern remains that some patients may be inclined to stop taking the prescribed medicines out of fear another point of contention has been the use of nsaids and a number of public health authorities have released statements claiming no evidence of such association existed nevertheless most recommended choosing alternative drugs if possible pending further investigation into nsaids finally the available evidence clearly points to a correlation between pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities and adverse outcomes with sars-cov-2 infections as severe cases are associated with myocardial damage considering the very high prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases it is important to continue researching the association between these conditions and covid-19  the use of adjuvant therapy in preventing progression to severe pneumonia in

severe pneumonia although fewer hypertensive patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers aceiarb therapy developed severe pneumonia in contrast with those on non-aceiarb that hypertension without receiving aceiarb therapy was an independent risk factor odds ratio or 207 95 ci 107 to 400 for developing severe pneumonia irrespective of age besides none of patients treated with chloroquine developed severe pneumonia though without significance difference 120 95 ci -35 to 300 by propensity score matching conclusions and relevance hypertensive patients on acei or arb may be protective from severe pneumonia in covid-19 and hence these therapies should not be ceased unless there is a strong indication or further epidemiological evidence though none of the current antiviral and immunoregulation therapy showed benefit in preventing covid-19 progression chloroquine deserved further investigation the world has witnessed the rapid escalation of 2019 coronavirus disease  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 now becoming a global pandemic 1 while many patients may be asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms reports so far have identified the elderly and patients with chronic comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease to be at higher risk of progression to severe covid-19 pneumonia characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome ards andor multiorgan failure 2 3 4 these severe patients require more intensive medical resource utilization and have worse prognosis with a case fatality rate about 20 times higher than that of non-severe patients 5 6 while the implementation of effective prevention measures is essential there clearly exists an urgent need for interventions to modulate disease progression in the face of an increasing number of infected individuals which have overwhelmed the capacity of hospital systems in some countries while there is no specific therapy for covid-19 current progress with investigational therapies includes the development and trial of a coronavirus vaccine and interrogation of several orphan drugs in randomized control trials rcts 7 this includes remdesivir which has garnered the most interest in an ongoing adaptive rct and other nucleotide analogues including ritonavir favipiravir and galidesvir 8 a recently published open-label rct showed no benefit of the protease inhibitors lopinavirritonavir in reducing clinical severity or mortality associated with covid-19 despite in vitro evidence of activity against sars-cov-2 9 other drugs of interest include antiviral therapy pegylated interferon-alpha arbidol and immunomodulators hydroxychloroquine are also under investigation and results are eagerly monitored 10 11  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  inhibition of the spike glycoprotein s-protein may also be a viable target and has recently garnered increasing interest -particularly the potential interactions with angiotensinogen converting enzyme 2 ace2 it is proposed that the binding of the sars-cov-2 s-protein to the functional receptor ace2 results in proteolytic cleavage by type ii transmembrane serine proteases tmprss2 12 13 14 there has been considerable interest and debate regarding the risk of severe covid-19 pneumonia in patients on angiotensinogen converting enzyme inhibitors acei or angiotensin receptor blocker arb therapy presumably through the modulation of ace2 expression 4 15 16 the role of acei and arb in covid-19 infection remains controversial -as the data is not adjusted for confounding factors of age and other comorbidities to definitively show that acei or arb are independently associated with worse outcomes -and of course this does not show causality either 17 hence various independent medical societies have put out position statements that recognize the potential risks but given the current quality of evidence recommend against inappropriate cessation or switch from aceiarb therapy for hypertension given its proven benefits 18 19 therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the role of several adjuvant treatments

this study we described the use of several adjuvant treatments in preventing severe pneumonia development in covid-19 patients hypertensive patients who received aceiarb therapy had a lower risk of developing severe pneumonia compared with those on non-aceiarb antihypertensive therapy which suggested that aceiarb therapy may be protective from severe pulmonary injury for hypertensive patients however these results should be interpreted with caution owing to potential bias and residual confounders in this observational study consistent with earlier reports and clinical experience around the world our cohort confirmed that  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  that older age and hypertension without aceiarb therapy were independently associated with developing severe pneumonia in covid-19 2 3 22 the association between age and severe pneumonia may be attributed to the accumulation of medical comorbidities with age or decline in immune function over time given the close collinearity between age and hypertension our study adjusted for age by multivariate regression analysis and revealed that hypertension remained an independent risk factor for disease progression irrespective of age for patients without receiving aceiarb therapy our study examined the controversial topic of covid-19 and aceiarb therapy in hypertensive patients we found that hypertensive patients on aceiarb therapy were less likely to develop severe pneumonia although we acknowledged that the analysis was conducted in limited sample size -with only 16 of 82 patients on acei arb therapy the dynamic profile of laboratory and radiological findings further showed that in patient on aceiarb therapy lactose dehydrogenase and ct lung score were lower in than those on non-aceiarb therapy at about 3 days after admission together these findings were suggestive that acei arb therapy may be protective in hypertensive patients with covid-19 covid-19 patients with hypertension may endure worse outcomes due to decreased ace2 levels ace2 an important component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas is highly expressed in both the lung and myocardium and converts angiotensin ii aii into angiotensin 1-7 which can downregulate ace and directly cause vasodilatation 23 24 25 downregulation of ace2 level has also been shown in hypertensive animal models although there has been limited success in translational confirmation in human studies 26 27 none the less this may be exacerbated by the further reduction in available ace2 following coronavirus infection both sars-cov and  cc-by-nc-nd 40

preprint  sars-cov-2 can gain entry into the host cell through binding of the s-protein to the membrane-bound ace2 aminopeptidase which then is cleaved by serine proteases to allow for membrane fusion and invasion 1428 following infection there is a reduction in pulmonary ace2 either through internalization with viral entry andor downregulation of ace2 enzyme during this process hence this may exacerbate the lower baseline ace2 function in hypertensive patients to lead to the accumulation of aii and reduced angiotensin 1-7 and subsequently worse immune-related cytolysis and lung injury which was validated by the linear association between elevated plasma aii level and viral load or lung injury in covid-19 patients 29 the use of acei or arb likely promotes feedback upregulation of ace2 expression in hypertension although there are animal and human studies which have also found either no effect or downregulation of ace2 level in the setting of diabetes hypertension or cardiovascular disease with or without acearb therapy 25 30 31 32 33 nonetheless this may explain our finding that aceiarb therapy can be protective in sars-cov-2 infection further evidence that would support this come from earlier studies in which aceistatins were protective in severe pneumonia recombinant ace2 protected mice from lung injury following sars-cov infection and raas blockade reduced acute lung injury in rats injected with sars-cov s-protein 34 35 currently there is still no specific treatment for covid-19 except for supportive care in our cohort 942 of non-severe patients received nonspecial antiviral therapy from just after admission the combination protocol and medication dose varied in different hospitals however our results did not support any single or combined antiviral treatments to limit the progression of covid-19 in addition none of 25 patients treated with chloroquine developed severe pneumonia though without statistical significance this is unfortunately limited by the degree of heterogeneity  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  in our cohort and relatively small size chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal ph required for viruscell fusion as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of coronavirus which has been confirmed to inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro 36 37 38 a recent open label non randomized clinical trial reported that hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin is significantly associated with viral load reductiondisappearance in covid-19 patients 39 even so more rcts to assess the therapeutic effects of chloroquine on covid-19 need to be conducted there were several limitations in this study first our study was conducted by retrospective data analysis second some cases had incomplete laboratory test results given the variation in the clinical management among different hospitals all data generation was clinically driven and not systematic third because most patients had recovered and discharged at the time of data cutoff and only 2 patients died during admission the impact of adjuvant treatment on the clinical outcomes cannot be analyzed forth there were limited hypertensive patients who received acei or arb therapy so we cannot analyze the effect of aeci and arb respectively a larger cohort study of covid-19 patients with hypertension from other cities in china and other countries would help to further validate the potential protective effect of aeciarb therapy covid-19 is a fast-evolving global pandemic with high mortality from severe pneumonia ards and multiorgan failure with the highest risk in the elderly and patients with underlying hypertension the current adjuvant antiviral and immunoregulation therapies have not yet proven

alanbaei jehad abubaker fahd al-mulla bosso  m thanaraj ta abu-farha m  alanbaei  m abubaker al-mulla j thangavel thanaraj alphonse  the mechanism for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 39 infection requires the binding of the virus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 40 receptor well-known for its role in counteracting ace ace2 is involved in modulating blood 41 pressure and establishing blood pressure homeostasis recently a critical debatable question 42  coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an ongoing pandemic of acute respiratory 59 disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the 60 mortality rates as well as the infectious capacity of the virus ranging from 1 to 5 has 61 raised a major concern worldwide older people with comorbid conditions such as pulmonary 62 disease cardiac disease kidney disease diabetes and hypertension are associated with higher 63 mortality rates 1 according to recent literature reports it is now well accepted that 64 hypertension is associated with increased mortality rates in covid-19 patients the mechanism for sars-cov-2 infection necessitates the binding of the virus to the 70 membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor and internalization 71 of the complex by the host cell figure 1  apart from its role as a receptor for sars-cov-2 and 72 for both the sars-cov and the related human respiratory coronavirus nl63 ace2 is well-73 known for its role in hypertension ace2 modulates blood pressure and maintains blood 74 pressure homeostasis through negatively regulating the renin-angiotensin system ras 45 75 angiotensin-converting enzyme ace and its homolog ace2 are two key enzymes involved in 76 the synthesis of bioactive components of the ras 6 ace2 exerts its functions through cleaving 77 either angiotensin i or angiotensin ii into the inactive peptides angiotensin 1-9 and 78 angiotensin 1-7 respectively figure 1  angiotensin 1-9 gets further metabolized into 79 angiotensin 1-7 angiotensin 1-7 is a vasodilator hence ace2 counteracts the 80 vasoconstrictor effects of the ace-angiotensin ii axis the mechanism by which ace2 81 antagonizes the effects of angiotensin ii is either by cleaving the precursor angiotensin i which 82 reduces ang ii synthesis in tissues or by directly hydrolyzing angiotensin ii and reducing its 83 levels in plasma 84 both ace and ace2 are endothelium-bound carboxypeptidases that can be cleaved by 85 different metalloproteases located on the cell surface and released in a soluble form contrary 86 to ace which is widely expressed in many tissues and organs ace2s high expression is confined 87 to the endothelial cells of the arteries arterioles and venules of the heart and kidney 4 88 therefore ace2 has been a potential therapeutic target in treating hypertension as well as 89 cardiac dysfunctions several animal studies carried out on diet-induced hypertension rat 90 models have established a link between increased blood pressure and reduced mrna 91 expression and protein levels of ace2 data showed that low levels of ace2 can lead to elevated 92 levels of ang ii and consequently hypertension 4 animal studies have suggested that 93 angiotensin-converting-enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers arbs may 94 upregulate ace2 expression thus increasing the availability of target molecules for sars-cov-2 95 the leeds family study by rice et al 2006  is one of the first studies to demonstrate 96 the link of ace2 polymorphisms and inheritance of hypertension and levels of circulating 97 ace2 7 several genetic association studies have examined the relationship between ace2 98 genetic variants and the risk of developing hypertension in different ethnic populations table  99 1 8 one of the highly reported variants is rs2285666 ag genotype at this variant is protective 100 as it poses a lower risk to develop hypertension in females 910 in contrast aa genotype as 101 opposed to aggg at the same snp rs2285666 has been reported to be associated with a 102 higher risk of hypertension in different ethnic populations 11-13 other highly reported variants 103 known to be associated with high risk to develop hypertension are rs2106809 with tt genotype 104 and rs879922 with c allele 1014-18 however the european population study revealed the 105 absence of an association between rs879922 and high blood pressure 19 there are concerns on whether medical management of hypertension involving the use of 112 inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas such as aceis and arbs have a 113 favorable impact on people infected with sars-cov-2 or a deleterious one mainly because acei 114 and arb therapies can modulate the expression of ace2 the concern is that the use of aceis 115 and arbs will increase the expression of ace2 and increase patient susceptibility to viral host 116 cell entry and propagation as a result there has been a call for the discontinuation of 117 aceiarb usage prophylactically and in the context of suspected covid-19 cases 118 in this review we shed light on the current debate about ace2 role in the mortality 119 associated with covid-19 cases with hypertension and weigh on the current argument about 120 the usage or discontinuation of aceiarb hypertensive medication finally we explore the role 121 of ace2 genetic variants in the predisposition for hypertension and the response to however a critical question that remains unanswered is whether this 129 association is solely attributed to the pathogenesis of hypertension or to the associated 130 comorbidity or therapy in this section we review recent findings regarding the role of 131 antihypertensive medications which have been at the center of a considerable debate namely 132 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceis and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs the 133 main question has been whether they have a favorable impact on the people infected with 134 sars-cov-2 or a deleterious one mainly since acei and arb therapies can modulate the 135 expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 that has been identified as a receptor 136 for sars-cov2 the concern is that the use of aceis and arbs will increase the expression of 137 ace2 and increase patient susceptibility to viral host cell entry and propagation as a result 138 there has been a call for the discontinuation of aceisarbs usage prophylactically and in the 139 on the other hand other groups have been suggesting the opposite where increased 141 ace2 can act as a vasodilator antioxidant and anti-inflammatory this is since ace2 primarily 142 acts to counterpoise the effect of ace as ace produces angiotensin ii from angiotensin i ace2 143 generates angiotensin 1-9 from angiotensin i or angiotensin 1-7 from angiotensin ii that none of these medications aceis arbs beta-blockers calcium-channel blockers or 168 thiazide diuretics was associated with increased infectivity to sars-cov-2 or increased covid-169 19 severity the study predefined a 10 difference as a substantial difference even though the 170 study was powered to detect as low as a 6 difference it is worth mentioning that the data 171 pointed to a modest decrease in the likelihood of testing positive for sars-cov-2 but not the 172 severity in patients taking beta-blockers that was slightly significant in an analysis that included insurance or health care access in propensity scores 23 nonetheless both the studies 176 highlighted that aceis and arbs as well as other antihypertensive drugs were safe to use 23 their data showed that treatment with ace-inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of 188 rapidly deteriorating severe disease there was a lesser rate of death or transfer to the icu 189 within 7 days in patients on an ace-inhibitor an odds ratio of 029 ci 010-075 p001 was 190 observed after adjusting for age gender several comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes 191 mellitus ischemic heart disease and heart failure they concluded that among hospitalized table 2  215 while two of the variants namely rs112171234 and rs75979613 downregulate the expression 216 of ace2 the others upregulate the eqtl variants are from the following genes the intergenic 217 region of ace2 bmx fancb the intergenic region of mospd2 asb9 ace2 the intergenic 218 region of ca5bp1 ca5b and cltrn almost all these variants are common variants minor 219 allele frequency  5 in one or the other population raising the possibility that genetic 220 regulation of ace2 expression can be more widespread however none of these variants is 221 associated with hypertension in any of the global studies ruling out the possibility of a common 222 genetic mechanism for the onset of hypertension and sars-cov-2 infection even at the level of 223 genes which harbor these eqtl variants none other than ace2 is known to be directly 224 involved in the onset of hypertension and the covid-19 however it requires further studies to 225 examine whether these genes are contributing to more extensive pathways regulating 226 hypertension or covid-19 disease 227 in several trials covid-19 patients who already were taking these drugs are being 308 randomized to continue or to stop them furthermore we must consider the higher rate of 309 cardiac injury and adverse outcomes in hypertensive patients during the covid-19 pandemic 310 undeniably the loss of aceisarbs cardiopulmonary protective effects could be damaging 311 additionally based on genetic analysis the eqtl variants regulating the expression of ace2 312 gene are not so far shown to be associated with hypertension however the ace2 313 polymorphisms associated with hypertension or with the efficacy of acei or arb could have the 314 potential to alter the binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein with ace2 receptor moreover it 315 requires further studies involving large cohorts to evaluate the genetic association of the 316 above-mentioned eqtl variants and the gene loci with hypertension traits and to evaluate the 317 involvement of the above-mentioned gene loci that affect the efficacy of acei and arb in sars-318 cov-2 infection and proliferation hence aceisarbs chronic therapy should not be 319 discontinued in hypertensive patients with covid-19 moreover in the absence of adequate 320 follow-up visits changing aceisarbs with another anti-hypertensive therapy could lead to 321 inadequate control of blood pressure thus as recommended by several medical associations 322 and in light of more scientific evidence supporting their beneficialnon-harmful impact 323 aceisarbs should be continued in covid-19 patients   effect of hypertension on outcomes of adult inpatients with covid-19 in wuhan china a propensity scorematching analysis qing yang ying zhou xinrong wang shan gao yang xiao weiming zhang yi hu yafei wang   in december 2019 a pneumonia caused by an unknown pathogen broke out in wuhan city the capital of hubei province china in january 2020 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was identified as the pathogen underlying the disease sars-cov-2 forms a unique clade of the sarbecovirus subgroup of the orthocoronavirus subfamily having emerged as the seventh coronavirus that can infect human beings 1  as of march 23 2020 the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 has surpassed 300000 globally resulting in more than 14000 deaths 2  previous studies have shown that patients with underlying comorbidities can have worse outcomes and some laboratory indicators are also associated with mortality 3 4  some studies have shown that hypertension is a risk factor for patients with severe covid-19 5  there have been more patients with hypertension among those who have died than among survivors however the effect of hypertension on outcomes of covid-19 patients is not completely clear or uniform therefore we designed this study to investigate the effect of hypertension on the outcomes of these patients using the propensity scorematching psm method to eliminate the influence of other confounding factors this single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted at the central hospital of wuhan a tertiary teaching hospital that is responsible for the treatment for patients of covid-19 as assigned by the chinese government all participants included in the study were local residents of wuhan who were hospitalized at central hospital of wuhan from january 1 to february 29 2020 relevant laboratory examinations common-pathogen detection and chest computed-tomography ct scanning were conducted each patient also underwent the sars-cov-2 nucleic-acid swab test with some patients testing positive and others negative the immaturity of the methods and an incorrect sampling method used for sars-cov-2 nucleic-acid detection might have contributed to false-negative results high-resolution ct scans with a scan layer thickness of 5 mm and reconstruction of a 1- to 15-mm thick layer are recommended for radiological examination of covid-19 patients the included patients were clinically diagnosed with covid-19 according to the world health organization whos interim guidelines 6  for patients who were suspected to have the illness two senior respiratory doctors made a joint diagnosis we divided the participants in our study into two groups survivors and non-survivors critically ill patients were defined as those who had the following clinical signs fever or suspected respiratory infection plus one or more of the following respiratory rate  30 breathsmin severe respiratory distress or oxygen saturation spo2  90 on room air patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards sepsis or septic shock were also included patients with other viral bacterial or fungal infections on admission and those with missing data were excluded participants with hypertension in the study had been previously diagnosed with same by a clinician and regularly took oral antihypertensive medications over a long period of time the outcomes observed in the study were either in-hospital death or discharge from the hospital this study was approved by the ethics committee of wuhan central hospital as it was a retrospective study and did not require protection of patients privacy we were exempted from obtaining informed consent we reviewed electronic medical records from which we obtained chronic comorbidities demographic data laboratory examination results and chest ct images data on counts or levels of white blood cells wbcs lymphocytes l neutrophils n alanine transaminase alt aspartate aminotransferase ast serum albumin alb serum creatinine scr blood urea nitrogen bun d-dimer and c-reactive protein crp were included diagnoses of hypertension came from the electronic medical records system length of hospital stay was obtained from discharge records from which we also learned the patients outcome scores on the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii apache ii had been calculated for critically ill patients within 24 h of admission we obtained dosage and duration of hormone use from physician medication order entry systems the physicians had acquired these data via an examination on the first day after admission all data were checked by another researcher to ascertain their accuracy continuous variables were presented as means standard deviation sd and compared using t tests if they were normally distributed or described using medians interquartile ranges iqrs if they were not the mannwhitney u test was used for comparisons we expressed descriptive data as number  for categorical variables and compared them via chi-square test or fishers exact test we used the kaplanmeier km method to evaluate the relationships between variables and outcome and cox proportional-hazard model cphm analysis to clarify the effects of each factor on outcome a two-sided  value of  005 was considered to be statistically significant we analyzed all data using ssps software version 220 ibm corp armonk new york us after performing statistical analysis as described above we conducted psm analysis to minimize the effect of selection bias and to control for potential confounding factors psm analysis attempts to compare outcomes between patients who have similar distributions of all covariates measured thus enabling further clarification of variables effects on outcome matching was performed using a 11 matching protocol without replacement greedy-matching algorithm with caliper width  02 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score we further adjusted for the comparative risks of outcomes in the matched cohort using a cphm a total of 226 patients with covid-19 were enrolled in our analysis from january 1 to february 29 2020 of these 111 4912 tested positive for sars-cov-2 nucleic acids non-survivors accounted for 2212 of all participants the basic characteristics of the study population are shown in table 1 non-survivors tended to be older and to have chronic comorbidities such as hypertension type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm and coronary heart disease chd however there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd between the two groups compared with survivors non-survivors had significantly higher serum n counts and higher levels of crp ast scr bun and d-dimer serum alb levels and l counts of non-survivors were lower than those of survivors the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes nl was significantly higher in non-survivors in addition no significant differences in sex alt levels or time from onset to admission were apparent
 before the multivariate cox regression analysis we performed km analysis to screen out the appropriate variables in order to make the results more accurate categorical variables with statistically significant differences between the two groups were directly analyzed by km analysis and continuous variables were converted into categorical variables according to the median number before km analysis after km analysis we found that age hypertension t2dm nl crp ast alb bun and d-dimer had effects on patient outcomes table s1 in the supplementary appendix we conducted multivariate cphm analysis to further certify whether variables affected patient outcomes those that did so were incorporated into cphm analysis as were sex and scr the results demonstrated that patients with hypertension had a higher mortality risk hazard ratio hr 3317 95 ci 17096440 p  0001 fig 1 in addition elevated d-dimer levels and higher nl might also have increased patients risk of death in table 2
 the basic characteristics of critically ill patients was listed table s2 in the supplementary appendix of these patients 4762 died non-survivors were older and more non-survivors than survivors had hypertension 4545 vs 7400 p  0005 nl and d-dimer levels were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors hormone use was slightly different between the two groups all severely ill patients were treated with methylprednisolone there was no significant difference in average daily dose of methylprednisolone between the groups surprisingly methylprednisolone was used for shorter durations in patients who died than in survivors in addition non-survivors had higher apache ii scores we also conducted multivariate cphm analysis of critically ill patients hypertension increased d-dimer levels higher nl and high apache ii score all increased the risk of death table 3 especially hypertension hr 2469 95 ci 12844749 p  0007 fig 2 methylprednisolone dose and days of use had no significant effect on outcomes of covid-19 patients
 the abovementioned results indicated that hypertension had a great influence on the outcomes of patients with covid-19 to decrease the effects of other confounding factors on the relationship between hypertension and outcomes we used one-to-one psm analysis before psm patients with hypertension differed significantly from those without on most of the covariates table 4 after psm between-group differences for all covariates were eliminated in the matched group we used cphm analysis to estimate the effect of hypertension on patient outcomes the results showed that patients with hypertension had significantly higher risk of death hr 2679 95 ci 12375805 p  0012 fig 3 in addition elevated d-dimer levels hr 1025 95 ci 10111039 p  0001 and higher nl hr 1107 95 ci 10531164 p  0001 could also increase patients mortality risk
 we applied the same analysis to critically ill patients using psm we matched 31 patients with hypertension with 31 without the results of prematching and postmatching were presented in the table s3 in the supplementary appendix after cphm analysis the results were similar to those we had obtained before matching table 5 the effect of hypertension on outcomes was still significant in critically ill patients fig4
 this retrospective cohort study showed that hypertension increased levels of d-dimer and higher nl were associated with increased mortality in patients with covid-19 high apache ii score was also correlated with death in critically ill patients hypertension was the most prominent of the abovementioned risk factors in both cohorts this study is the first to report risk factors for mortality in covid-19 patients using psm analysis the results of psm were the same as those we had already obtained before psm analysis via psm analysis we provided robust evidence to support the association between hypertension and increased mortality in a study involving 191 patients with covid-19 logistic-regression analysis showed that odds of in-hospital death were higher in patients with hypertension 4  in another study conducted in january 2020 11 of 99 patients with covid-19 died and 3 of the 11 had hypertension 7  yang et al performed a systematic review and meta-analysis including 46248 covid-19 patients 5  the results showed that the pooled odds ratio or of hypertension in severe patients was 236 95 ci 146383 compared with non-severe patients indicating that hypertension might be a risk factor for severely ill patients in addition previous studies have shown that hypertension was also a factor in the prognoses of patients infected with other viruses hypertension was one predictor of ards in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome per the results of a study on clinical features and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome 8  based on the six indices of multilobular infiltration hypo-lymphocytosis bacterial coinfection smoking history hyper-tension and age guo et al created the mulbsta score system based on a multivariate logistic-regression model to predict mortality in patients with viral pneumonia within 90 days 9  the or of hypertension is 239 and its mulbsta score is 2 a study on influenza suggested that patients with hypertension suffered a significantly higher risk of death or 149 95 ci 110210 than patients who had no comorbidities 10  researchers reported the deaths of three people infected with avian-influenza h7n9 virus in shanghai in 2013 two of them had hypertension 11  the role of hypertension in covid-19 progression remains unclear our results showed that l count in the hypertensive group was significantly lower than in the non-hypertensive group and the same was true in critically ill patients we speculated that the poor outcome of the hypertension group might be associated with impairment of immune function caused by the decrease in lymphocytes consistent with our hypothesis a recent study involving 61 patients with hypertension showed a significant decrease in peripheral blood cd3 cd4 and cd8 t-cell in hypertensive patients versus healthy controls 12  additionally it has been found that some angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin ii receptor blocker drugs could significantly increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 messenger ribonucleic acid in rat hearts 13  as ace2 is the receptor of sars-cov-2 in humans the increase in ace2 messenger ribonucleic acid expression could aggravate the illness further study is needed to determine whether certain antihypertensive drugs contribute to poor clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19 finally hypertension and other chronic diseases share some common characteristics such as a proinflammatory state and attenuation of the innate immune response therefore the body cannot effectively control the virus in the early stage which leads to aggravation of illness in covid-19 patients 5 14  further study is needed on the role of hypertension in this disease in addition to hypertension we found that high d-dimer levels and high nl were associated with increased in-hospital mortality of covid-19 patients in general and of critically ill ones in particular which was consistent with previous studies nl might reflect levels of both inflammation and immune response of the human body during viral infection some studies have shown that coronaviruses consume many immune cells leading to a great reduction in lymphocytes which inhibits cellular immune function damage to t cells might be an important factor leading to deterioration of patients 7 15  neutropenia represents the aggravation of inflammatory response and cytokine storm while lymphocytes are the main immune-active cells in the body and l count is an early marker of physiological stress and systemic inflammation 3 16 17  wang et al have reported that in 33 patients with covid-19 survivors had higher n counts and lower l counts than non-survivors 16  neutrophils are proven to be related to the development of ards and progression from ards to death in patients with covid-20193 in a study by zhou et al univariate analysis showed that decreased l count was associated with in-hospital death in such patients 1  consistent with our results a recent study of 191 patients with covid-19 showed that d-dimer  1 gml was associated with fatal outcomes 1  in the other two studies including 33 and 183 patients with covid-19 d-dimer levels were significantly higher in non-survivors versus survivors 16 18  recently a bivariate cox regression analysis also suggested that higher d-dimer levels were related to the development of ards and progression from ards to death in patients with covid-19 hr 103 95 ci 101104 and hr 102 95 ci 101104 respectively 3  the mechanism of fatal outcome in patients with higher d-dimer could be that systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine responses induce the production of procoagulant factors and hemodynamic changes 1 19  in addition our study showed that a high score on the apache ii a tool for estimating disease severity and mortality in-hospital in critically ill patients was associated with increased mortality in patients with severe covid-19 patients with high apache ii scores have also been found to have higher risk of death in other studies these studies suggest that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with high apache ii scores the following shortcomings existed in our research first this was a single-center study with a limited number of cases included at this writing the epidemic has spread throughout the world a multi-center study should be carried out that includes other hospitals in wuhan other cities in china and other countries worldwide as it will yield a more comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting the outcomes of covid-19 patients second as this study was retrospective the indicators included in our study were finite the findings of chest ct viral load in the respiratory tract or circulation angiotensin ii and lymphocyte subsets could be potential indicators of outcomes of patients which should be further confirmed by more studies finally due to failure to record the classification stratification and use of antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension it is necessary to further explore whether these factors could influence patient outcomes hypertension high d-dimer levels and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio all increased mortality in patients with covid-19 with hypertension being the most prominent factors clinicians should note these findings multicenter prospective studies with large samples are needed to further validate the findings  hypertension is associated with increased mortality and

enzyme inhibitor ace-i or angiotensin-receptor blocker arb which even though
still controversial may increase susceptibility and severity of covid-194 this study was
aimed at investigating the association between hypertension and poor outcome in
patients with covid-19 pneumonia by performing a systematic review and
meta-analysis we included all research studies enrolling adult covid-19 patients with

figure 4b based on our meta-analysis hypertension was shown to be associated with increased
composite poor outcome that consists of mortality severe covid-19 ards need for
icu care and disease progression in patients with covid-19 this association was
influenced by gender but not age cardiovascular disease diabetes and copd the
association between hypertension and increased poor outcome was stronger in studies
with lower percentage of male patients it is still unclear whether hypertensive people are more likely to contract covid-19
infection however individuals with hypertension tend to more severely affected by
covid-19 with ace2 becomes a likely explanation40 ace2 a type 1 integral
membrane glycoprotein which is found in the epithelial cells of cardiac kidney
lung and intestinal tissue converts angiotensin ii to angiotensin 174041 thus the
presence of ace2 neutralizes the inflammatory effects of angiotensin ii reduces the
levels of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 enhances the anti-inflammatory and
antioxidant roles of angiotensin 17 increases the concentration of alveolar
surfactant protein d and triggers vasodilation4243 it is likely that novel
coronavirus responsible for covid-19 worked through a similar pathway as the
coronavirus that caused sars-cov where they use ace2 on the surfaces of epithelial
cells as a receptor to attach and enter the host pneumocytes4042 viral surface spike s
protein of covid-19 binds to ace2 receptor following the spike protein activation by
transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss24445 activation of the renin-angiotensin system ras in various tissues is associated
with conditions such as hypertension regular use of medications including arb and
acei upregulates ace2 expression therefore facilitating the entry of sars-cov-2
into pneumocytes which ultimately increases the severity and fatality of
infection4042 overexpression of ace2 which is supposed to provide protection
for the lungs is downregulated after viral uptake as the enzyme gets diminished
resulting in reduced angiotensin-ii degradation increased aldosterone secretion and
consequently loss of potassium via urine42 the interplay between hypertension gender and ras may be the explanation of our
result regarding the association of hypertension and outcome in a lower percentage
of male patients in hypertensive females there is greater activity of angiotensin
ii type 2 receptor at2r than angiotensin ii type i at1r which translates into
attenuation of harmful response of at1r activation46 more expression and activation
of at1r are seen in hypertensive males and hypothesized in causing vasoconstriction
pro-inflammatory response increasing oxidative stress leading to ards in severe
covid-194748 this condition provides an explanation for the higher incidence
of severe covid-19 in males compared to females oestrogen is postulated in bringing
the predisposition towards good ras in females49 although we did not have data
concerning the menopausal status of the women in the included studies the majority
of subjects included in the studies were in older age groups this could explain why
the association between hypertension and outcome was stronger in studies with a
lower percentage of male patients nevertheless this result has to be interpreted
cautiously due to the known limitations of meta-regression and is only a
hypothesis-generating finding an individual patient-level sub-group analysis
preferably with adjustment to various confounders needs to be performed to confirm
or deny this preliminary finding currently there is no scientific evidence showing that the termination of acei and
arb in patients with covid-19 infection would be beneficial and the authorities in
the field still recommend those patients to continue their regular
anti-hypertensives theoretically inhibiting the breakdown of angiotensin ii using
acei or blocking angiotensin at1r using arb could decrease inflammation
systematically and specifically in the lung heart and kidney which ultimately
reduces the potential complication of covid-19 including ards myocarditis and
acute kidney injury50 discontinuation of acei or arb in covid-19 patients with hypertension might
potentially be harmful as they continue to offer cardiovascular and renal
protection in fact the use of arb has been studied for the treatment of covid-19
and its complications studies have shown that covid-19 downregulates ace2
expression and hinders its organoprotective effect51 it is hypothesized that
unregulated angiotensin-ii activity leads to multiple organ injury5253 furthermore
ace2 has been shown to protect lungs from ards54 hence drugs that may increase
ace2 may offer protection rather than harm although ace2 is singled out as the port of entry for covid-19 it plays a
substantial anti-inflammatory role in reninangiotensinaldosterone system ras
signalling the elderly with hypertension have lower ace2 levels and higher ras
signalling which develops to extremely low ace2 levels and markedly elevated ras
signalling after covid-19 infection resulting in a likely reduced incidence of
disease but greater severity55 on the contrary younger
individuals without hypertension have higher ace2 levels and lower ras signalling
which turns to modestly low ace2 levels and modestly enhanced ras signalling after
they are infected with covid-19 resulting in a potentially increased incidence of
disease but lesser severity this supports the suggestion of continuing treatment
with ras antagonists such as aceiarb in order to prevent further lung injury due to
covid-19 including sepsis-associated lung injury55 the effect estimate for
subgroup analysis for age  55 and  55 years old differs slightly in which  55
years old was associated with slightly higher risk however because meta-regression
did not demonstrate significant differences across age groups the significance
remains uncertain and direct comparison between the older and younger patients is
needed regardless of potential benefit or harm associated with aceiarb controlling blood
pressure is important to prevent cardiovascular complications data on hypertensive
medications were lacking in the included studies hence we are unable to provide
meta-analysis or meta-regression for aceiarb hypertension was associated with increased poor outcome in patients with covid-19 and
the association was not affected by age gender presence of cardiovascular disease
diabetes or copd this designates that hypertension may act as one of the potential
prognostic factors for covid-19 severity that should be sought in the triage the label hypertension is not universal the included studies may have different
definition of hypertension the stage of hypertension and whether they are
controlled or poorly controlled were also unknown data on chronic hypertensive
medications were not adequately reported by the included studies and so cannot be
analysed such data may provide insight on the aceiarb impact on prognosis
additionally the included studies were subject to potential confounders that may
weaken or strengthen the effect estimate the result of the meta-regression has to
be interpreted cautiously due to the known limitations of such analysis most of the
articles included in the study were published at preprints servers and as such are
not yet peer reviewed majority of the studies originated from china the patients
perhaps overlapping across the reports most of the studies included were
retrospective in design hypertension was associated with increased mortality severe covid-19 ards need for
icu care and disease progression in patients with covid-19 the association was
stronger in studies with a lower percentage of male patients  asthma and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic a literature review mrio morais-almeida helena pit rita aguiar ignacio ansotegui jean bousquet   a new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection began to spread in wuhan china in early december 2019 and has rapidly spread around the globe the disease condition associated with this novel coronavirus is referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and this outbreak was declared a pandemic on march 11 2020 by the world health organization who 1 as of may 15 2020 the outbreak had reached globally 4580498 confirmed cases and 305618 deaths and only 1735657 patients had recovered 2 these numbers are much greater than those registered during the sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers pandemics which occurred in 2003 and 2013 respectively 3 despite the fact that the covid-19 mortality rate to date is lower 2 3 sars-cov-2 binds mainly to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors in host cells which are abundant in the lungs heart blood vessels and intestine and after more than a decade of research there are still no specific treatments or effective vaccines for coronavirus 3 4 5 6 covid-19 presents with respiratory symptoms from mild to severe and a significant percentage of patients develop acute respiratory disease syndrome ards these severe symptoms are associated with a true cytokine storm in particular il-6 and death can be one of the outcomes 7 old age and underlying morbidities such as cardiovascular diseases in particular hypertension and metabolic disorders obesity and diabetes have been identified as significant risk factors for covid-19 morbidity and mortality 7 8 9 however asthma and copd may not be common comorbidities 10 moreover the real impact of sars-cov-2 in asthma control is unclear results from the first epidemiologic studies of the covid-19 pandemic in china apparently did not identify asthma as a risk factor of severe covid-19 10 11 of 171 children treated at wuhan childrens hospital wuhan china 3 18 required intensive care and mechanical ventilation all of them had underlying diseases but there was no asthma reference 12 the same data was found in a cross-sectional multicenter study carried out in 10 hospitals across hubei province china including hospitalized children with covid-19 13 table 1 dong et al 14 china in a nationwide case series of 2135 pediatric patients mean age 7 years with covid-19 observed cases at the chinese center for disease control and prevention from january 16 2020 to february 8 2020 hubei province and did not report any asthma case in a survey of 140 adult patients admitted with covid-19 china the clinical characteristics and allergy status of the patients was investigated all of the patients were community-acquired cases hypertension 300 and diabetes mellitus 121 were the most common comorbidities drug hypersensitivity 114 and urticaria 14 were self-reported by several patients asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients and the authors concluded that allergic diseases and asthma were not risk factors for sars-cov-2 infection an older age and a high number of comorbidities ie cardiovascular and metabolic diseases were associated with covid-19 severity 15 the same authors studied a larger sample of 290 confirmed covid-19 adult patients who were hospitalized and they found only 1 patient with asthma 03 once again hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most frequently found comorbidities 16 in another retrospective multicenter cohort study that included 191 adult inpatients with confirmed covid-19 wuhan china 48 had at least 1 comorbid disease with hypertension being the most common followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease with no asthma reference 17 in a survey of 70 adult patients admitted with covid-19 in tongji hospital wuhan china an asthma prevalence rate of 09 was found this is markedly lower than that in the adult population in this region 64 18 in this study asthma was not identified as a risk factor for disease severity in contrast with hypertension 18 a nationwide analysis from china 19 including 1590 covid-19 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions reported an overall rate of severe cases and mortality of 160 and 32 respectively the most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension 169 followed by diabetes 82 one hundred thirty 82 patients reported having 2 or more comorbidities none of the cases had physician-diagnosed asthma after adjusting for age and smoking status copd hr  2681 95 ci 14245048 diabetes hr  159 95 ci 103245 hypertension hr  158 95 ci 107232 and malignancy hr  350 95 ci 160764 were identified as significant severity risk factors including for intensive care unit icu admission mechanical ventilation and death 19 in europe in a sample of 355 patients with covid-19 who died in italy with a mean age of 795 years it was reported that comorbidities were associated with an increased mortality risk thirty percent of patients had ischemic heart disease 355 had diabetes 203 had active cancer 245 had atrial fibrillation 68 had dementia and 96 had a history of stroke once again no reference to chronic respiratory diseases was made ie asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd 20 also in a retrospective case series of 1591 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 admitted to icu in 72 hospitals of the lombardy region in italy between february 20 and march 18 2020 68 of the patients had at least 1 comorbidity hypertension was the most common comorbidity affecting 49 of the 1043 patients with available data the second most common comorbidities were cardiovascular disease 21 and hypercholesterolemia 18 only 4 had a history of copd with no reference to patients with asthma 21 in the confidence study22 that included 100 pediatric covid-19 cases also from italy median age 33 years 58 with mild disease and only 1 with severe disease there was no reference to chronic respiratory diseases as was found in previous pediatric chinese surveys by lu et al 12 and dong et al 14 borobia et al 23 from la paz university hospital madrid spain in a sample of 2226 adult patients median age 61 years admitted to hospital who either died 207 or were discharged 793 identified that the most common comorbidity was hypertension 413 followed by other chronic cardiovascular diseases 193 and diabetes 171 asthma was identified in 52 of covid-19 patients with a lower prevalence rate of 37 in the fatal cases copd affected 69 of the population with a prevalence of 141 in the fatal cases also from spain in catalonia prieto-alhambra et al 24 analyzed a primary care database covering 6 million people including 121263 covid-19 patients both hospitalized and outpatients most common comorbidities were hypertension 243 and obesity 199 asthma was present in 68 of the patients and copd was found in 32 107 of all patients were treated with inhalers in 200 covid-19 patients hospitalized in the lausanne university hospital switzerland 25 an asthma prevalence rate of 40 was found the asthma prevalence rate was 27 in those patients who required mechanical ventilation in the usa bhatraju et al 26 seattle wa usa reported 24 patients with covid-19 admitted to the icu with a mortality rate of 50 as coexisting disorders 58 had diabetes 22 were current or former tobacco smokers 21 had chronic kidney disease and 14 had asthma corresponding to 3 cases with mild asthma who had been treated with systemic corticosteroids in the week before icu admission as outpatients for a presumed asthma exacerbation these patients were subsequently admitted to the icu with severe respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation 26 arentz et al 27 wausa described in a case series the characteristics and outcomes of 21 patients with covid-19 admitted to the icu at evergreen hospital with a mean age of 70 years range 4392 years the more common comorbidities identified were chronic kidney disease 476 congestive heart failure 429 diabetes 333 and copd 333 two patients had asthma 95 data from the usa regarding 345 cases in children 18 years showed that 23 had at least 1 comorbidity 28 chronic respiratory diseases ie asthma were the most common associated diseases although the authors did not quantify the prevalence comorbidities were more frequently present in pediatric patients who required hospitalization compared to those who were not admitted to hospital 77 vs 12 but there was no reference to asthma as a significant risk factor 28 in a sample of 377 adult covid-19 patients admitted to california usa hospitals 74 had nondiscriminated asthma or copd 29 a data analysis of patients hospitalized in 14 states of the usa with covid-19 during march 2020 n  1482 30 confirmed that hospitalization was much more frequent in adults 745 aged 50 years among patients with information on underlying conditions n  120 89 had 1 or more comorbidities the most common were hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases 775 followed by obesity 483 and diabetes mellitus 283 seventeen percent of the covid-19-positive patients had asthma and 107 had copd according the centers for disease control and prevention cdc report in admitted patients aged 1849 years obesity was the most prevalent underlying condition 590 followed by asthma 273 30 a report from 8 hospitals georgia usa

patients hospitalized with covid-19 in the new york city area ny usa 142 were treated in the icu 122 received invasive mechanical ventilation and 21 died 32 an asthma prevalence was found in 90 with no reference to asthma severitycontrol and copd was found in 54 the most common comorbidities were hypertension 566 obesity 417 and diabetes 338 32 in the ny mount sinai hospitals an 82 prevalence of asthma was found in 2199 of hospitalized patients it was not significantly different in those who died 74 33 also in ny usa in the first 1000 consecutive adult patients with a positive sars-cov-2 pcr test who presented to the emergency department or were hospitalized at new york-presbyteriancolumbia university irving medical center between march 1 and april 5 2020 an asthma prevalence of 113 was found it was also not significantly different in those that were admitted to the icu 123 34 in the isaricprospective observational cohort study35 with near real-time analysis with the participation of 166 uk hospitals 16749 covid-19 hospitalized patients were included between february 6 and april 18 2020 mostly adults the commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease 29 uncomplicated diabetes 19 non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease 19 and asthma 14 47 had no documented reported comorbidity increased age and comorbidities including obesity were associated with a higher probability of mortality 35 very recent data from the opensafely collaborative study 36 identified asthma as a significant risk factor of death from covid-19 in england uk the authors conducted a cohort study that included 17425445 adults using national primary care electronic health record data linked to in-hospital covid-19 death data from february 1 2020 to april 25 2020 an older age age was strongly associated with risk with the age group 80 years having a more than 12-fold increased risk compared to those aged 5059 years most comorbidities were associated with a higher risk of covid-19 hospital death including asthma fully adjusted hr  111 95 102120 with a greater hr for those with recent use of an oral corticosteroid ocs hr  125 95 ci 108144 36 data from the uk biobank 37 in a prospective case-control study showed an asthma prevalence of 179 in 605 covid-19 hospitalized patients most of them adults the asthma prevalence was of 135 in the control population but the disease was not identified as an independent risk factor for covid-19 hospitalizationseverity in contrast with hypertension and copd in the oldest population age 65 years included in the uk biobank 38 the same tendency of asthma prevalence was found between hospitalized covid-19 patients versus controls 182 vs 130 but again asthma was not identified as an independent risk factor for severity in a report from the middle east saudi arabia39 that included 150 hospitalized adult patients mean age 461 years it was found that 288 and 260 of the covid-19 population had hypertension and diabetes respectively the asthma prevalence was 27 and 1 patient with asthma was admitted to the icu in a study aiming to estimate the risk factors for hospitalization and death in a mexican population 40 infected with sars-cov-2 n  10554 mean age 465 years 394 hospitalized and 92 fatal cases hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity found 217 followed by obesity 2015 and diabetes 177 the asthma prevalence was 36 of this population 31 in the hospitalized patients and in 32 in the fatal cases patients with hypertension obesity and diabetes were more likely to be hospitalized and die than people without these comorbidities once again asthma was not identified as an independent risk factor for hospitalization andor mortality 40 based on the available literature there was no clear evidence that patients with asthma were at a higher risk of being infected or becoming severely ill with sars-cov-2 although recent reports from the usa and the uk suggest that asthma is much more common in children and adults with covid-19 than was previously reported in asia and in the first surveys in continental europe nevertheless the prevalence of several underlying conditions identified in us hospitalized patients with covid-19 was similar to those for hospitalized influenza patients during influenza seasons 201415 through 201819 ie regarding chronic respiratory diseases 2931 41 of particular note in the uk is the association of asthma with a higher risk of covid-19 hospital death with the hr increasing further for those who received ocs probably indicating a greater severity of disease this contrasts with previous findings in several countries where asthma and other chronic respiratory diseases have been underrepresented in hospitalized patients 36 also in the uk asthma was reported in 140 and 179 of hospitalized patients but with no increased risk of death 35 37 among school age children viral infection reportedly accounts for up to 85 of asthma exacerbations and viruses are more frequently isolated from symptomatic patients than from asymptomatic patients 42 43 even though respiratory viruses are one of the most common triggers for asthma exacerbations in all age groups not all of these viruses affect patients equally in particular the human rhinovirus was identified as the main individual contributor for asthma exacerbations with coronavirus being one of the less identified triggers of asthma exacerbations in children as well as in adults 44 a recent literature review concerning virus detection during asthma exacerbations confirmed that exacerbations were mainly associated with rhinovirus infection in all continents 45 in previous sars outbreaks patients with asthma in particular children appeared to be less susceptible to the coronavirus with a reported low rate of asthma exacerbations and a good prognosis on follow-up 10 46 in contrast during influenza epidemics asthma was associated with more severe disease including the need for mechanical ventilation not only in adults but also in children 47 the exact reasons for this remain unknown but it was confirmed during the current coronavirus pandemic 48 from the recent covid-19 literature no definite conclusions can be drawn regarding asthma control or severity similarly no information can be extrapolated about asthma phenotypes ie regarding whether asthma is allergic or not covid-19 outcomes vary from asymptomatic infection to death and it is possible that this clinical range reflects different airway levels of the sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 and the spike protein activator transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 considering that the virus cell entry also depends on s-protein priming by host cell proteases blood eosinophil levels are a well-known predictor of airway t2 inflammation 49 and the measurement of blood eosinophil levels can be used as an accessible not strong proxy for investigation of the association between airway t2 inflammation and covid-19 outcomes in early reports from china a detailed clinical investigation of hospitalized covid-19 cases suggested severe eosinopenia together with lymphopenia as a potential indicator of the diagnosis and to a worse prognosis including death 15 it was believed that low eosinophil counts in peripheral blood would be related to the sars-cov-2 infection itself however more recent studies from china and from italy have not reported eosinopenia in patients with severe covid-19 26 31 50 although the relationship between eosinophil counts and covid-19 is uncertain attention is warranted to monitor eosinophil counts among patients with asthma who are using biological therapies that lead to decreased eosinophil counts and the clinical course of covid-19 in cases infected with the sars-cov-2 51 sajuthi et al 52 studied in children the role of both t2 inflammation and viral infection in regulating the gene expression of ace2 and tmprss2 and they found a strong influence of t2 cytokine-driven inflammation on both ace2 downregulation and tmprss2 upregulation expression levels which can have clinical implications for covid-19 outcomes in contrast the authors found an equally strong positive influence of respiratory virus infections on ace2 expression 52 so at least theoretically in patients with asthma and high t2 inflammation the consequence of an interferon-dependent inflammation requires close monitoring given the enhanced risk of complications due to sars-cov-2 infection a recent study that included asthma patients from 3 different cohorts of children and adults found that ace2 receptor expression was lower in those patients with high allergic sensitization but nonatopic asthma was not associated with this reduced expression 53 these data suggest that this reduced ace2 expression may be a potential contributor among several other factors of reduced covid-19 severity in patients with respiratory allergies ie allergic asthma 53 additionally there is some early evidence coming from the severe asthma research program-3 sarp that inhaled corticosteroid therapy is also associated with reduction on ace2 and tmprss2 gene expression from sputum 54 these data stress the importance of maintain asthma controlled using the treatment according to the best practices including with inhaled steroids there is also evidence to support that taking ics may be beneficial in dealing coronavirus infections in vitro studies have shown inhibitory actions of budesonide on coronavirus hcov-229e replication and cytokine production 55 and preliminary not yet peer-reviewed data suggest that ciclesonide blocks sars-cov-2 ribonucleic acid replication 56 and inhibits its cytopathic activity 57 which may have clinical implications although gene expression for ace2 and tmprss2 did not differ in healthy and asthmatic patients it was also found that males african americans and patients with diabetes have increased expression of ace2 and tmprss2 in their sputum cells which may be associated with the poor prognosis of these patients when infected with the sars-cov-2 54 dong et al 58 very elegantly described selected cases of patients with covid-19 children and adults demonstrating the profile complexity and different clinical presentations from mild to severe cases patients with common allergic diseases such as rhinitis or atopic dermatitis did not develop distinct symptoms or had severe courses which may suggest a positive balance of type 2 immune regulation in covid-19 pathogenesis new data are emerging daily rapidly updating our understanding of this novel coronavirus but it is crucial that patients with asthma and other allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis maintain their controller medication from inhaled corticosteroids to biologics 51 59 60 including allergen immunotherapy 61 without making any dose adjustments on their own or stopping medication which may lead to a higher risk of asthma exacerbations increased ocs use and a higher probability of the need for emergency room access and hospitalization risk factors for coronavirus exposure and spread likewise it is important to maintain well-controlled rhinitis and rhinosinusitis together with other known risk factors for asthma exacerbations 62 the available data about ocs use in asthma exacerbations though limited to 3 reported cases in mild asthmatics 26 are in accordance with data from previous coronavirus outbreaks showing that systemic corticosteroids can be associated with a higher viral load 63 64 the uk data suggesting an increased death risk in patients with asthma especially in those who recently received systemic steroids 36 stress that clinicians must be cautious and recognize the differences between hypoxic respiratory failure and bronchospasm to carefully balance the need for ocs prescription 51and bronchodilators must be delivered by metered dose inhalers with spacers in order to prevent the viral spread related with nebulizer use 65 as was shown by kaye et al 66 there is evidence of increased adherence to asthma and copd pharmacologic treatment during the first months of covid-19 which is encouraging and hopefully will have a positive effect on improvement of the control of asthma and minimize the need for acute care for this inflammatory chronic respiratory disease in conclusion it is unclear whether patients with asthma are at a higher risk of developing covid-19 andor becoming severely ill future studies in all age groups are needed to provide a greater understanding of the impact of underlying asthma other allergic diseases and t2 inflammation on covid-19 susceptibility and disease outcomes the better we understand these interactions the better we will be able protect the most vulnerable people including those in

faming zhao lili zhi xiqian wang lin liu zhaohui bi yunhe zhao   during the past two decades the outbreak and prevalence of severe acute respiratory infections have been seen as one of the most serious hazards to global health both two prominent coronaviruses 2002 sars-cov and 2012 mers-cov have markedly affected humans causing 8422 and 1600 infections as well as 916 and 574 deaths respectively 1 2 in early december 2019 a series of pneumonia cases with unknown reason emerged in wuhan hubei china high-throughput sequencing from lower respiratory tract samples has revealed a novel coronavirus that was named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and also named sars-cov-2 3 as of february 17th 2020 70636 confirmed cases and 1772 death cases have been documented in china 2019-ncov also targets the respiratory tract and shares many similar clinical symptoms with sars-cov and mers-cov 3 common symptoms include fever fatigue and dry cough followed always by anorexia myalgia dyspnea and so on 48 lymphopenia and prolonged prothrombin time are also the most common characteristics 46 in addition as cardiologists we are also concerned about whether patients with cardiovascular disease are at greater risk for 2019-ncov and whether new coronavirus infections have an impact on the cardiovascular system previous studies have shown a relationship between cardiovascular metabolic diseases and sars and mers 911 a systematic analysis of 637 mers-cov cases showed that diabetes and hypertension are prevalent in about 50 of the patients and cardiac diseases are present in 30 of the cases 11 diabetes was seen as an independent predictor for mortality and morbidity in patients with sars 9 with the spread of 2019-ncov and increase of the cases more and more 2019-ncov infected individuals exhibit comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes and cardia-cerebrovascular disease in chens study of 99 cases 40 patients had cardia-cerebrovascular disease 6 and in huangs study of 41 cases 20 patients had diabetes 4 these cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities might render them more susceptible to poor prognosis given the rapid spread of 2019-ncov an updated meta-analysis with significantly larger sample sizes by integrating the published studies is urgently warranted accordingly the present analysis will not only identify the cardiovascular epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-ncov infection with greater precision but also unravel the impact of the infection on the cardiac injury preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of individual participant data the prisma-ipd statement was followed for the conduct and reporting of this meta-analysis 12 to identify all the studies illustrating the prevalence and impact of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in 2019 novel coronavirus infection in china embase and pubmed were carefully searched from december 2019 to february 2020 the following search terms or keywords were used alone or in combination novel coronavirus influenza pneumonia cardiovascular disease hypertension diabetes and cardiac injury inclusion criteria are as follows 1 comparative studies randomised controlled trials rcts or non-rcts published in english 2 study population more than ten participants were included in the study 3 study intervention patients in the studies should be confirmed to have been infected by 2019 novel coronavirus 4 parameters the comorbidities of cardiovascular metabolic diseases and the outcome of cardiac injury should be given case reports non-human studies studies without adequate information and studies written in chinese for the fear of data duplication were excluded in the present meta-analysis prevalence of comorbidities including hypertension cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes table 1 and fig 2 together with clinical outcome of cardiac injury confirmed by elevation of troponin it or the creatine kinase seen as the second choice if troponin it were not provided were extracted from the identified studies table 1 and fig 3 the primary outcome measure was to compare the prevalence of comorbidities and impact on cardiac injury in icu and non-icu cases severe and non-severe data as the second choice if icu data was not provided cochrane collaborations tool was followed to assess the risk of bias all analyses were performed using openmeta analyst version 1010 httpswwwcebmbrowneduopenmeta and revman software version 53 forest plots were used to illustrate the prevalence of the cardiovascular metabolic diseases in 2019-ncov infection severity from the selected studies as well as the impact of the 2019-ncov infection on the cardiac injury the results of the included studies were performed with fixed-effect models mantelhaenszel method 13 or random-effect models in cases of significant heterogeneity between estimates 14 we used the i2 statistics to assess the magnitude of heterogeneity 25 50 and 75 represented low moderate and high degrees of heterogeneity respectively the chosen of the proper effect model was based on the analysis results the fixed effect model was used if i2  50 and the random effect model was used if i2  50 15 after initially identifying 399 articles 111 duplicate documents were identified of the leaving trials after review of the titles and abstracts 277 documents of non-human researches reviews and studies that were not clinical trials were excluded the leaving 11 studies were carefully and detailed evaluated at last six studies were excluded because the participants of the trials did not meet the criteria we have set then one study published in medrxiv was added finally a total of six studies with 1527 patients were included 46 8 16 17 fig 1 all of the selected studies were published in 2020 with different sample patient sizes that ranged from 11 to 1099 patients table 1 summarizes the study characteristics systematic analysis of studies that described the epidemiological and clinical features of covid-19 cases and reported the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases as well as the impact on cardiac injury in the infectious disease has identified six reports with 1527 patients table 1 the majority of the cases were localized in wuhan or recent travel to wuhan or contact people from wuhan the median ages were respectively 56 49 47 555 34 and 57 years old according to the six studies the infection was diagnosed throughout the whole spectrum of age covering from new born to 92 years old in all of the studies men were more likely to be infected than women and the overall proportion of male is 578 meta-analysis for the identified studies showed that the most prevalent cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities were hypertension 171 95 ci 99244 and cardia-cerebrovascular disease 164 95 ci 66261 followed by diabetes 97 95 ci 69125 fig 2 there was a significant heterogeneity cochrans q in the estimates of comorbidities among the identified studies with an i2 index varied from 47 to 95 fig 2 we then compared the difference of the prevalence of the three diseases between severe patients and non-severe patients or icu patients vs non-icu patients according to the data in the studies for hypertension and cardia-cerebrovascular disease the heterogeneity test results were calculated as i2  47 and 26 thus the fixed-effect model was used for further analyses the results from the three included studies with a total amount of 1278 patients showed that hypertension accounted for 288 of icusevere cases but 141 of non-icusevere cases a similar pattern was found in cardia-cerebrovascular disease statistics it accounted for 167 of icusevere cases but 62 of non-icusevere cases the proportion hypertension and cardia-cerebrovascular disease were both statistically significant higher in icusevere patients compared to the non-icusevere patients hypertension rr  203 95 ci 154 268 z  504 p  000001 cardia-cerebrovascular disease rr  330 95 ci 203 536 z  481 p  000001 fig 2 for diabetes the heterogeneity test showed that i2  67 and so the random effect model was used diabetes accounted for 117 of icusevere cases but 40 of non-icusevere cases the result indicated a higher proportion of diabetes in icusevere patients but without statistical significance rr  221 95 ci 088 557 z  168 p  009 fig 2 at last we focused on the impact of the covid-19 on the cardiac injury two studies that gave clear data were statistically analyzed and the data showed that 80 95 ci 41120 patients might be suffered from an acute cardiac injury another two studies only gave the data of creatine kinase if it can be seen as a biomarker of cardiac injury the proportion might be 115 95 ci 78152 when we attempted to compare the differences of cardiac injury incidences between icusevere patients and non-icusevere patients we just included the two studies which specifically identified myocardial injury the data again showed a significant higher incidence of acute cardiac injury in icusevere patients compared to the non-icusevere patients rr  1348 95 ci 360 5047 z  386 p  00001 fig 3 the funnel plots demonstrated symmetrical distributions of the effect size of hypertension cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and cardiac injury on either side of the pooled estimate but a non-symmetrical distribution of the effect size of diabetes fig 4  coronaviruses are enveloped rna viruses which include six species that can cause diseases in humans to our knowledge 18 four viruses among them 229e oc43 nl63 and hku1 have been reported to cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals 18 however the two other strains are the infamous sars-cov and mers-cov which have been linked to fatal illness and caused plagues and large numbers of deaths 19 complete genome sequences of 2019-ncov showed that it is identified as a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the sarbecovirus subgenus of coronaviridae family the same subgenus with sars-cov 3 according to previous research on sars-cov the presence of comorbidities increased the mortality risk with cardiac disease and diabetes being the most important components to predict adverse outcomes 20 cardiac disease and diabetes increase the risk of death by twice as much as other risk factors 20 thus it is necessary for us to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac and metabolic diseases in covid-19 the present systematic analysis summarized the data from all of the five studies of covid-19 the results demonstrated that the overall proportion of hypertension cardia-cerebrovascular disease and diabetes were respectively 171 164 and 97 according to summary of the 2018 report on cardiovascular diseases in china the morbidities of the hypertension and diabetes were respectively 232 and 109 and there were about 13 million of cerebrovascular disease patients and 11 million of cardiovascular patients 21 therefore comparing the data to the report we did not find that people with hypertension and diabetes were more susceptible to 2019-ncov infection the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in people infected with the virus is about the same as in the general population even slightly lower however comparing the general population the incidence of cardia-cerebrovascular disease in patients with covid-19 is obviously much higher due to the sample size and limited time so far data collection is still incomplete and most of the studies have not analyzed comorbidities in death cases so the relationship between cardiovascular metabolic diseases and covid-19-induced death cannot be determined but what is assuredly is that patients with hypertension cardia-cerebrovascular diseases or diabetes are more likely to develop severeicu cases after 2019-ncov infection the overall proportion of hypertension cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds threefolds and twofolds respectively higher in icusevere cases than in their non-icusevere counterparts although the difference of diseases in the meta-analysis is not statistical the rr value is about 221 and we consider this might because of the sample size of included studies and the algorithm adopts the random effect model which is a more conservative approach so we speculate the result might reach statistical significance when more researches publish their data another important finding is the damage the virus did to the heart according to the present summary at least 80 patients with covid-19 suffered acute cardiac injury in chens report the first death was a 61-year old man with no previous chronic underlying disease after he was admitted by icu he had developed severe respiratory failure heart failure and sepsis and then experienced a sudden cardiac arrest on the 11th day of admission and was declared dead 6 this case reminded us that patients with a novel coronavirus might develop acute cardiac injury and further analysis indicates us that the incidence of myocardial injury is much higher in icusevere patients about 13 folds more than non-icucardiac patients and furthermore the observation also reminded us that patients with covid-19 associated with unstable angina or stemi have poor cardiac reserve lower tolerance to severe pneumonia and are more likely to develop cardiac insufficiency leading to deterioration according to the information released by shanghai health commission the first covid-19 death in shanghai was a patient 88 years old with a serious history of hypertension cardiac dysfunction the analysis of death causes suggested that the patient died of heart failure and systemic multiple organ dysfunction and in the course of its onset the 2019 ncov infection is only the inducement the pathogenesis of 2019 ncov infection-related acute myocardial injury is still unknown but according to the clinical presentation and lab data of the disease as well as the pathogenesis of sars-cov it can be speculated that 2019-ncov infection may affect the cardiovascular system through multiple mechanisms first viral infection directly causes damage to cardiomyocyte according to oudits study sars-cov viral rna was detected in 35 of autopsied human heart samples from sars-cov infected patients during the toronto sars outbreak 22 and they also confirmed that pulmonary infection with the human sars-cov in mice led to an ace2-dependent myocardial infection 22 ace2 is an important target for sars-cov 23 and molecular modelling has shown high structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of sars-cov and 2019-ncov 24 ace2 expression is highly tissue-specific mainly expressed in the cardiovascular renal and gastrointestinal systems with a small amount expressed in lung cells therefore in addition to coronaviruses causing pneumonia through ace2 receptors in lung epithelial cells we also need to pay attention to possible viral effects on myocardial tissue second hypoxaemia may be also an important reason of cardiac injury in huangs study 32 covid-19 patients had various degree of hypoxaemia and need required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support in chens study up to 76 of patients require oxygen therapy due to severe 2019-ncov infection the pneumonia may cause significant gas exchange obstruction leading to hypoxaemia which significantly reduces the energy supply by cell metabolism and increases anaerobic fermentation causing intracellular acidosis and oxygen free radicals to destroy the phospholipid layer of cell membrane meanwhile hypoxia-induced influx of calcium ions also leads to injury and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes third huangs study noted that high concentration of il-1 ifn- ip-10 and mcp-1 could be detected in patients infected with 2019-ncov which might lead to activated t-helper-1 th1 cell responses 4 furthermore they also found that icu patients had much higher concentrations of inflammatory factors than those non-icu patients suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity 4 in addition repeated floods of catecholamines due to anxiety and the side effects of medication can also lead to myocardial damage in conclusion patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of infection of 2019-ncov and it can also greatly affect the development and prognosis of pneumonia simultaneously we should pay close attention to viral infection-related heart damage in the course of disease treatment  the interplay of hypertension ace-2 and sars-cov-2 emerging data as the ariadnes thread for the labyrinth of covid-19 costas tsioufis kyriakos dimitriadis dimitrios tousoulis   none none dr william h stewart the us surgeon general during 19651969 is remembered primarily for his infamous statement it is time to close the book on infectious diseases five decades later how erroneous this statement was in 2020 humanity is facing one of the most devastating health urgencies in known modern history leading to health system collapse economies shutting down unemployment surges and thousands of deaths worldwide due to covid-19 infection1 for the cardiovascular medical community there are important issues to be clarified and in this editorial our attempt is to provide the latest evidence-based directions for the intriguing labyrinth-like associations of hypertension renin-angiotensin system and covid-19 the hype of the hypertension link to covid-19 pandemic was fueled by the initial reports from wuhan china in which hypertension was present in 30 of cases and in 48 of non-survivors2 in 138 hospitalized patients with covid-19 hypertension was observed in 31 58 in intensive units3 and the official data from the national health commission of china demonstrate that 35 of patients diagnosed with covid-19 have hypertension with the overall case fatality rate being 23 in the entire cohort but significantly higher 6 in patients with hypertension4 the only available meta-analysis from wuhan of 46248 cases supports that hypertension constitutes the most prevalent comorbidity in 17 of patients infected with the novel coronavirus5 the globality of the pandemic stresses the need for international data in italy the most current analysis shows that of 691 of the deceased patients were hypertensives and 30 used angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors aceis and 17 angiotensin receptor blockers arbs6 despite the above observations there are no robust data to suggest clearly an independent link of hypertension with increased covid-19 morbidity and mortality7 similarly in other lower respiratory track infections diabetes and heart failure are independently related to adverse outcome while hypertension per se is not7
 major pathophysiological pathways by which covid-19 causes cardiovascular and systemic complications is diffuse inflammatory response and ace-2 figure 1
 the characteristic covid-19 cytokine storm is reflected by increased il-17 il-7 il-6 interferon-c and tnfa7

8 focusing on il-6 it is associated with the outcome from the viral infection and also plays a key regulator role of immune-inflammatory response in essential hypertension7 supportive to the latter hypertension pathogenesis and progression of target organ damage is closely associated with low-grade inflammation9 and this could partially explain the fact that hypertension is the most common comorbidity in covid-19 cohorts and related to worst course of the infection7 the confounding effect however of ageing and other comorbidities like diabetes and renal dysfunction in this inflammatory link should be taken in mind with future studies urgently needed in this setting in humans the entry of the new coronavirus into the target cells is facilitated by the spike protein that is anchored to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 in parallel with cellular serine protease tmprss2 actions7 ace-2 converts angiotensin ii to angiotensin 1-7 figure 110

11 receptors of the ace-2 are expressed in the epithelial cells of lungs intestine kidneys heart and vessels and their activation causes vascular dilatation and provide renal and cardiovascular protection7

10

11 in this sense promoters of ace-2 are studied as potential antihypertensive drugs10

11 the novel coronavirus sars-cov2 by using the ace-2 consumes the enzyme and the protective actions of the latter are significantly attenuated the non-counterbalanced actions of angiotensin ii are partially responsible along with inflammation and thrombotic milieu to the covid-19 related severe complications at the level of the lungs the virus reduces the activity of the ace-2 and regionally stimulates the renin-angiotensin system with leucocytes infiltration facilitation further accelerating the progression of the inflammatory response in a relative study covid-19 patients were characterized by higher angiotensin ii levels that were closely related to the total viral load and the degree of lung injury12 recombinant ace-2 administration has been proposed as a means to reduce angiotensin ii levels and lung tissue lesions10

11 concerning the heart and vascular component of covid-19 infection dysregulation of the ace-2 related pathways are linked to cardiac muscle injury and potential hemodynamic collapse10

11
 given consideration of the above the million dollars question is about the effects of renin angiotensin blockers on ace-2 expressionaction and most importantly what is the clinical relevance of this modulation in humans in the context of covid-19 there are data from animal studies for a more consistent upregulation of ace-2 with the majority of arbs while the effect of aceis was variable7 this knowledge led to the opinion of potential susceptibility of patients on aceis and arbs to covid-19 infection13 but this is currently unjustified firstly the data in humans are scarce and only in the small intestine enterocytes upregulation of ace-2 is reported due to acei14 regarding the lungs there are zero evidence for humans and even if existed cannot directly lead to the conclusion that this upregulation can indeed facilitate viral cell entry7 if one wants to focus on pneumonia outside the covid-19 setting the use of aceis and arbs reduces the risk of infection15 and related mortality7
 in the era of covid-19 social distancing the scientific approaching by rapid and free exchange of knowledge provides the scaffold for better therapeutic answers we should be therefore thankful to the researchers for the important emerging data16 17 18 19 firstly zhang p et al conducted a retrospective multi-center study including 1128 adult patients with hypertension diagnosed with covid-19 and admitted to hospitals in the hubei province16 they showed that the incidence of the 28-day all-cause death among hypertensives who had inpatient treatment with aceisarbs is significant lower compared with aceiarb non-users 37 vs 98 p  00116 even after matching and adjusting variables in-hospital use of aceisarbs still exhibits remarkable association with reduced all-cause mortality and even more recently three simultaneous publications shed further light into the debate of renin-angiotensin therapies in the covid-19 setting 17 18 19 the work by reynolds h et al showed that among 12594 patients who were tested for covid-19 there was no association of aceisarbs with increased likelihood of a positive test or severe infection17 further insight is provided by mancia g et al focusing in 6272 cases with severe covid-1918 after adjustment for confounders there was no independent association for the use of aceisarbs with susceptibility for infection or worse clinical outcome in contrast to loop diuretics that were linked to enhanced risk18 interestingly the publication by mehra m et al included international data from 169 hospitals 11 countries in asia europe and north america for 8910 patients with covid-19 for whom discharge status was available19 there was no harmful association of either aceis or arbs with mortality but also it was demonstrated that the use of statins and aceis was linked to less in-hospital deaths19 these findings clearly support recently published recommendations by many societies regarding continuation of aceis or arbs among patients with co-existing hypertension cardiovascular disease and covid-1920

21 moreover they provide further rationale for ongoing studies with drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system for therapy of covid-19 like losartan for hospitalized ct04312009 and non-hospitalized patients nct04311117722
 there is a trending notion that there is not only a second wave of covid-19 pandemic linked to the infection per se to be worried about but also a third and maybe a more important one this third wave in the upcoming months and years is related to major events that would lead to a massive burden to the health systems because of covid-19 related postponed guideline care in major disease states among them the cardiovascular ones for hypertensive patients this is highly relevant due to the lack of regular follow-up along with destabilization of blood pressure levels due to unjustified discontinuation or modification of dosage of aceisarbs that can lead to heightened cardiovascular risk23 this outside-the- norm approach to chronic diseases might be a reaction of the public as well as of some health providers to the media-induced frenzy for the novel coronavirus attention should be paid to the latter phenomenon and the cardiovascular community has already played a key role on establishing guidance for treatment and continuity of care for high risk patients7

20 interplay with the organization of the health systems and governments is needed to sufficiently address the burden of cardiovascular emergencies and routine cases throughout the covid-19 era with clinical strength and scientific rigor the labyrinth of unanswered questions will be solved and the covid-19 outbreak will be limited concerning hypertension therapy it seems at present to be immune to covid-19 lets be optimistic and let the emerging data be our ariadnes thread  renin-angiotensin system inhibition in cardiovascular patients at the time of covid19 much ado for nothing a statement of activity from the directors of the board and the scientific directors of the italian society of hypertension guido iaccarino claudio borghi arrigo cicero f claudio ferri pietro minuz maria muiesan lorenza paolo mulatero giuseppe mul giacomo pucci massimo salvetti carmine savoia leonardo sechi alberto massimo volpe guido grassi   the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome sars due to coronavirus 2 cov-2 infection pandemic and subsequent spread of the disease called covid-19 brought back to discussion a topic already highlighted during the sars-cov-1 and coronavirus-related sars known as the middle east respiratory distress syndrome mers of 2002 and 2013 during those outbreaks it was observed a particularly elevated incidence of cardiovascular disease among patients who were also characterized by being elderly and in particular during the mers prevalently male 1 2 another main topic of the discussion is the role of the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace 2 indeed this carboxypeptidase has been identified as a functional receptor for the spike protein of the coronaviruses outer membrane including sars-cov-2 3 ace2 is strongly expressed in the epithelium of different organs such as the kidney heart and lungs ace2 shares a large affinity to the amino peptidase ace that is target to the ace inhibitors a class of antihypertensive drugs ace inhibitors represent the most used class of cardiovascular agents in the world for the treatment of epidemic cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension and heart failure although not directly inhibited by ace inhibitors ace2 is affected by chronic treatment with this class of drugs which leads to an increase in ace2 expression in several tissues 4 interestingly this feature is also shared by another class of drugs the angiotensin receptor-1 blockers arbs whose chronic administration is as well able to increase the level of expression of ace2 and also its activity as assessed by the circulating levels of the ace2 product angiotensin 17 5 these findings support the concern that the treatment with renin-angiotensin system ras inhibitors could make covid-19 symptoms more severe due to increased expression of ace2 remarkably both issues have been re-proposed in the occurrence of the present epidemic of covid-19 in particular the issue of the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases among covid-19 patients is proposed by observational data obtained in chinese 6 and italian patients 7 in this context we still lack the analysis of the confounding effects of age on the apparent association between cardiovascular disease covid-19 infection and clinical severity indeed the observed prevalence of male and elderly patients observed especially in the italian covid-19 population is a confounding factor that needs to be corrected for before any conclusive association is drawn this concern has been expressed by many 810 similarly the ace2 upregulation argument has never been demonstrated in humans indeed while there is conflicting evidence from animal studies that arbs probably not ace inhibitors may upregulate membrane-bound ace2 in tissue-specific manners eg heart but not kidney these data cannot be extrapolated to humans and are not sufficient to support facilitation of sars-cov-2 entry 9 in particular it has never been demonstrated that the ace2 upregulation in the human lung occurs upon ras inhibition and even less that this causes a worsening of the covid-19 disease furthermore it can also be speculated that ace2 upregulation is protective indeed it has been shown that the binding of coronavirus to ace2 leads to the downregulation of ace2 11 which in turn causes an aceace2 imbalance and to the excessive production of angiotensin ii by the related ace enzyme this excess of angiotensin ii stimulates angiotensin ii receptor type 1 at1r and might cause an increase in pulmonary vascular permeability and lung damage 12 therefore according to this hypothesis the upregulation of ace2 caused by the chronic intake of at1r and ace inhibitors could be protective through two mechanisms first by blocking the increased production of angiotensin 17 which has been advocated as a possible mechanism of protection for the lung second by reducing the production of angiotensin ii it removes a cause of lung damage 13 in this context of uncertainty there are advocates within the scientific community raising their voices for the cessation of ace inhibitors and arbs among patients taking these drugs that is claimed for both the prevention of the infection and the attenuation of the symptoms in case of infection these speculative claims are then taken over by the laical press starting a word of mouth that sustains panic behaviors among the general population the italian society of hypertension siia therefore takes a clear and firm position in line with statements by other international societies see table 1 siia states the following itemsthere is no evidence to associate hypertension or other cvds with covid-19 disease if hypertension was a predisposing factor for coronavirus infection there should be more hypertensives among covid-19 patients than observed in the general population to date there is no evidence that people with hypertension are overrepresented among those infected with covid-19there is no clinical evidence in humans that associates the intake of ace inhibitors or arbs with covid-19 disease at present we can neither say that they improve nor say they worsen the susceptibility to coronavirus infectionthere are no clinical data in patients that can confirm the harmful effect not even the protective one of ace inhibitors and arb in the context of the covid-19 epidemic furthermore siia reiterates that subsequent points 
aacute suspension without medical control of cardiovascular therapy and specifically of antihypertensive treatment increases the occurrence of acute events including hypertensive emergencies heart failure decompensation heart attacks and strokebthe favorable effects of ace inhibitors and arbs on the control of the progression of cvds in general and in particular of hypertensive patients have been confirmed for many years and for this reason ras inhibitors represent central agents for the management of cardiovascular conditions that cannot be easily substituted 10cin hypertensive patients with covid-19 or at risk of covid-19 infection ace inhibitors and arbs treatment should be maintained according to the recommendations contained in the 2018 escesh guidelines 10dsimilarly in all patients currently on therapy with ace inhibitors arbs and in the case of patients with heart failure also the arnis these drugs must not be suspendedein patients with covid-19 with severe symptoms or sepsis ace inhibitors and arbs like all other antihypertensive drugs should be used or discontinued on a case by case basis taking into account current guidelines
 siia hopes and promotes further research that analyzes the constantly increasing data on the impact of hypertension and antihypertensive drugs in particular ace inhibitors and arbs on the clinical course of covid-19 infections in order to update these positions as new evidence becomes available in particular to clarify which mechanism is prevalent and has a role in the clinical manifestation of covid-19 siia has launched a fact-finding investigation to verify the impact of therapy with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system on the onset and clinical manifestation of the disease covid-19 this observational research is based on an online questionnaire made of 18 questions to collect information on medical history and the evolution of the disease in covid19 patients id nct04331574 clinicaltrialsgov  coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and its implications for cardiovascular care expert document from the german cardiac society and the world heart federation  michael bhm norbert frey evangelos giannitsis karen sliwa andreas zeiher m   after the first cases of respiratory illness were reported in december 2019 a novel coronavirus designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was identified to cause the so-called coronavirus disease covid-19 which meanwhile has become a worldwide pandemic 1 2 in general three distinct phases characterize progression of covid-19 an initial infection phase followed by a respiratory distress phase and finally culminating in a severe hyperinflammation state with more than 80 of sars-cov-2 infections showing only mild or even absent symptoms 3 the characteristics from the covid-19 outbreak reported from china 3 provided important lessons with respect to cardiovascular involvements both as a primary target as well as a comorbidity the infection phase marks virus infiltration and proliferation of the epithelium and lung parenchyma accompanied by mild symptoms and monocyte  macrophage activation as the initial immune response the ensuing inflammatory processes like vasodilation endothelial leakiness and leukocyte extravasation lead to pulmonary distress with pulmonary damage fluid extravasation and hypoxemia which in turn augments cardiovascular stress finally further amplification of the host inflammatory response will essentially culminate in systemic inflammation up to eliciting a cytokine storm 4 importantly the cardiovascular system emerges as both a primary target as well as the most important secondary co-morbidity factor during all three of the covid-19 progression phases fig 1 there is accumulating evidence that the heart itself might be a direct target for viral infection with sars-cov-2 5 previous studies examining the cardiovascular effects of viral respiratory infections during influenza epidemics revealed a profound up to sixfold increased incidence ratio for acute myocardial infarction within 7 days of infection in part due to the heightened prothrombotic activity leading to intracoronary thrombotic events 6 hypotension and tachycardia will further imbalance the metabolic demand of a diseased heart exaggerated systemic inflammation with profoundly increased circulating levels of prototypical inflammatory markers such as il-6 il-2 tnfalpha mcp-1 or crp are well established to contribute to cardiac injury irrespective of the presence of hypoxemia indeed some of these biomarkers were shown to be associated with high mortality in retrospective clinical series of covid-19 patients hospitalized in china 7 indicating potential serious bystander effects on other organs including the heart in support of such collateral damage to the heart increased inflammatory markers do correlate with electrocardiographic abnormalities and biomarkers of cardiac injury 8 finally elevation of cardiac biomarkers documenting cardiac involvement is not only a prominent feature in covid-19 but is also associated with a profoundly worse clinical outcome 9 10 myocardial damage and heart failure contributed to almost 40 of deaths in a critically ill cohort hospitalized in wuhan 11 cox regression analyses revealed that the mortality risk associated with acute cardiac damage was significantly higher than age chronic pulmonary disease or prior history of cardiovascular disease 8 9 thus both direct and indirect mechanisms of cardiovascular injury most likely play a pivotal role for the deleterious consequences of sars-cov-2 infection in addition to the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ards last patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with sars-cov-2 are more likely to develop severe symptoms if infected with sars-cov-2 and may also be more vulnerable to adverse cardiotoxic effects of treatment with antiviral drugs a most recent analysis from the leoss registry 12 displaying the prevalence of co-morbidities in covid-19 patients in germany disclosed that in all classes of disease severity more than 50 of the patients suffered from cardiovascular co-morbidity which was by far the most prominent co-morbidity associated with covid-19 fig 2 taken together cardiovascular involvement is both highly prevalent and of significant prognostic importance in covid-19 therefore it is not only important to fully involve cardiologists for managing cardiovascular complications in severe cases of covid-19 but also to pay particular attention to cardiovascular protection of patients at risk to develop covid-19 it will be essential to allocate sufficient resources for cardiovascular diagnostic and therapeutic procedures even at times when the health care systems are globally overwhelmed and hospitals are guided by measures to contain and treat this infectious disease we need to advice patients that cardiovascular emergencies like stemi decompensated heart failure or life-threatening arrhythmias need immediate attention and treatment and emergency calls should not be delayed out of fear for being admitted to a hospital with the potential to acquire covid-19 we do need to set-up emergency treatment strategies for non-covid-19 patients in-hospital and assure protection of these patients from sars-cov-2-infected patients additionally we need to make sure to that hospital staff and health care workers in general are adequately protected and diagnostic and interventional procedures in covid-19 patients are guided by clinical necessity fortunately all major cardiovascular professional societies are meanwhile in the process of publishing guidance for various aspects of cardiovascular care in covid-19 patients including how and in whom to perform diagnostic and therapeutic interventions some of these guidance publications will be referenced to in the following chapters of this article this will without any doubt lead to greater awareness of the immediate cardiovascular implications of this infectious disease nevertheless we should not stop here hospitalization for pneumonia was previously shown to be associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease up to 10 years of follow-up 13 it is very likely that sars-cov-2 infections with respiratory impairment will also lead to similar long-term adverse events we need to monitor covid-19 patients with acutely elevated markers of cardiac damage with respect to long-term consequences on cardiac function including definite proof of sars-cov-2-induced myocarditis by myocardial biopsy likewise it will be important to assess potential long-term cardiotoxic effects of antiviral therapy thus cardiovascular care during the covid-19 pandemic should already implement strategies to capture longer-term implications by prolonged clinical follow-up covid-19 has spread to almost all countries of the world unexplained is the different impact of the disease in different countries there has been a slow increase in infections in africa and south-east asia with a surprisingly low fatality rate 14th april 2020 south africa had 2272 infections with 27 deaths despite a detailed surveillance system wwwcoronavirusjhuedu accessed 14th april 2020 it is currently unknown why there has been so far a slower than expected rise in cases and case mortality in low-to-middle income countries the population demographics and underlying co-morbidities are vastly different in those countries the mean age of many low-to-middle income countries is more than 2 decades lower than in higher income countries for example in uganda the life expectancy at birth for males and females is 60 and 65 years wwwwhoorg 485 of the population is in the age range of 014 years old with just 2 of the population being older than 60 years this age pyramid influences the current uganda cardiovascular health challenges which does include hypertension and coronary artery disease mainly in urban areas but rheumatic heart disease rhd and heart failure due to cardiomyopathies remain enormous challenges most of the patients do not have access to balloon valvotomy or surgery 14 untreated symptomatic patients with rheumatic heart disease have a mortality rate of 20 per annum leaving very few patients being able to live beyond their 40 years of age 15 however there are other factors which might have an impact the country-by-country difference in covid-19 morbidity and mortality could possibly be explained by national policies on bacillus calmette guerin bcg vaccination bcg is a live attenuated strain derived from an isolate of myocobacterium bovis used widely across the world as a vaccine for tuberculosis with many low-to-middle income countries but also some high-income countries such as japan having a universal bcg vaccination policy in newborns bcg vaccinations have been shown to produce non-specific immune effects leading to an improved response against other non-myocardial pathogens another possible protective mechanism could be the high number of people living with hivaids on anti-retroviral therapy south africa has a population of 57 million with  12 being hiv-infected sa has the worlds largest antiretroviral therapy art program subsidized by the government and provided free-of-charge only time will tell if low-to middle income countries will catch up on the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 or remain relatively spared 16 the world heart federation has published a briefing on prevention coronavirus disease 2019 in low-income countries 17 this includes six easy rules to reduce the risk of corona virus transmission from staying at home and avoiding large gathering to a total shut down of a country had so far the biggest impact in a lower number of infections and early case detection the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas regulates blood pressure and is also involved in cardiovascular endorgan damage like myocardial hypertrophy interstitial myocardial fibrosis atherosclerosis and plaque rupture in acute coronary syndromes therefore blockers of the raas are recommended for the use in hypertension to prevent cardiovascular events and heart failure 18 19 the protease renin cleaves angiotensin to angiotensinogen i ang 110 which then is processed to angiotensin ii ang 18 by the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace 20 angiotensin ii stimulates at1-receptors which results in adverse cardiovascular effects like vasoconstriction cell proliferation and hypertrophy 21 in contrast the at2-receptor mediates vasodilation anti-proliferative actions and apoptosis and has been suggested to be involved in anti-proliferative effects upon binding of angiotensin ii 22 angiotensin ii 18 is cleaved by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 into angiotensin 17 23 which exerts directly a stimulation of the so called mas-receptor mediating vasodilation anti-proliferative effects and anti-inflammatory responses 24 it is now well established that the corona virus family binds via its spike protein to ace2 25 26 with well characterized binding residues 27 after proteolytic modification of ace2 28 and the coronavirus spike protein 11 12 by a membrane-bound proteinase adam17 the virus is internalized by clathrin-coated pits and after trypsin cleavage viral rna is released into this cellular cytoplasm causing sars infection 28 29 ace2 is degraded and shedfrom the cell membrane into the circulation after cleavage by adam17 28 30 as a result there is a downregulation of ace2 by the corona virus itself 31 the role of ace2 in corona virus infection is scrutinized by the fact that several animals cannot be infected by the corona virus when there is a knockout of ace2 which renders them resistant to infection 32 the role of ace2 is not specific for the corona virus as ace2 is also used by the respiratory syncytial rs virus and some types of influenza viruses 33 34 ace2 can also be regulated in several cardio-pulmonary disease conditions like copd pulmonary hypertension asthma and after viral infections with influenza h1n1 h5n1 h7n9 as well as in sepsis 35 ace2 potentially by degrading maladaptive angiotensin ii and stimulating anti-inflammatory responses through the mas receptor 24 has been shown to improve lung injury after viral infections of clinical injuries 36 furthermore ards is not prominent after rs virus infections when the ace2 is knocked out 33 in addition recombinant human ace2 has been tested in a pilot study in human ards and has been shown to reduce circulating interleukin-6 concentrations accompanied by increases of ang 17 and reductions of angiotensin ii 37 therefore ace2 might be crucial for the entry of corona viruses into the cells and hence infectivity 2530 however it might also mediate beneficial effects on pulmonary complications after infection 36 37 the fact that the major risk factor for adverse outcomes in covid-19 is age and ace2 is downregulated in the aging population argues in favor of its role in poor outcome of that risk group 35 furthermore drugs like chloroquine and indometazine 35 as well as ace inhibitors and arbs 3840 have been shown to upregulate ace2 in the human heart and in the systemic as well as pulmonary vasculature 40 with association to outcomes in heart failure 41 atrial fibrillation 42 and pulmonary hypertension 43 these findings highlight the complex interaction of covid-19 and ace2 inhibition we would thus raise the hypothesis that pathophysiological conditions or drugs enhancing ace2 expression might lead to greater infectivity but at the same time potentially reduce mortality due to lung complications fig 3 arterial hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor in cardiovascular disease in particular in china 44 in several early trials of covid-19 populations hypertension is the most prevalent cardiovascular risk factor and comorbidity is amounting to approximately 3040 in the overall population of diseased individuals in china 7 45 46 and italy 47 in those patients who have complications or even died hypertension is more prevalent as was diabetes coronary artery disease chronic obstructive lung disease or malignancies 9 as hypertension is the comorbidity with the highest prevalence in deceased patients it has been claimed to be a risk factor for covid-19 however this would only be the case if there is a deviation from the overall prevalence of hypertension in the chinese population in china the prevalence of hypertension is high by comparing chinese populations age-matched to those in reports on covid-19 approximately 5574 years it becomes clear that the overall prevalence in hypertension is 44 with a further increase in populations at higher age 48 therefore the prevalence of the comorbidity hypertension in covid-19 patients is lower and does not exceed the overall prevalence in the relevant populations in china therefore there is no evidence that hypertension increases the likelihood to suffer from covid-19 cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities are elevated in patients who have fatal outcomes after covid-19 9 therefore all cardiovascular comorbidities in concert add to myocardial injury which has been shown to be closely associated with death as measured from cardiac troponin levels 9 the next question arises of whether cardiac treatments and treatments with the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors rasi in particular ace-inhibitors ace-i or angiotensin receptor blockers arbs are associated with a differential outcome in covid-19 the guidelines for the management of hypertension of the european society of cardiology 18 but also chinese guidelines 49 and guidelines of the american college of cardiology acc and american heart association aha 19 recommend ace and arbs for the treatment of hypertension as these drugs have been shown to be effective in secondary prevention heart failure and protection against adverse renal outcomes in germany as in other countries in europe the prescription rate of ace and arbs are higher than all prescribed daily doses of other anti-hypertensive drugs combined 50 however adequate blood pressure control in china in the age group where covid-19 is most prevalent was only 349356 51 according to the 2010 chinese guidelines 49 and 152160 according to the 2017 accaha guidelines 19 in particular the frequency of ace-inhibitor treatment is particularly low in an asian population in particular in females because the ace-induced coughing is more prevalent than in other populations 51 therefore the low density of treatment with rasi does not argue in favor of a significant role of these drugs in the likelihood of covid-19 the upregulation of ace2 by rasi does not allow to argue in favor or against the use of ras-inhibitors in hypertension as recently expressed in various short communications and letters causing a lot of discussion and media attention 5258 although a large body of evidence has been generated in cell models animal models and observational studies further data are necessary to scrutinize the definite role of ace2 in infection frequency and causation of pulmonary complications after corona infections at this moment there is thus no compelling evidentiary background to change rasi therapy for hypertension or other cardiovascular conditions based on findings from corona and influenza infections in the past it has been speculated that acute myocardial injury might be triggered or facilitated in covid-19 infection 59 66 a previous study on the incidence of myocardial infarction after the outbreak of influenza infections in ontario reported a sixfold higher incidence ratio of ami within 6 days after a positive influenza test as compared to a negative test during the same time frame 66 it was hypothesized that an exaggerated inflammatory response mediated by viral infection with influenza a or b respiratory syncytial virus rsv or other virus had the potential to trigger acute plaque rupture in addition anecdotal evidence from sporadic case reports raised the suspicion of acute myocarditis although a direct sars-cov-2 infiltration of the heart has not been confirmed in the absence of histological confirmation by endocardial biopsy or by detection of viral genome in myocardial tissue yet 67 previously a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction lv-ef and a highly prevalent reversible subclinical diastolic left ventricular impairment that was reported in acute sars-cov-2 infection and was attributed to the cytokine storm syndrome that is characterized by an uncontrolled and dysfunctional immune response 68 finally cardiotoxic effects of antiviral therapies have been reported 69 acute myocardial injury may occur independently from covid-19 and may manifest as type 1 myocardial infarction stemi or nstemi type 2 mi in the absence of plaque rupture or intracoronary thrombus or as an acute myocardial injury independent of myocardial ischemia fig 4 cases of acute mi on autopsy during hospitalization for covid-19 have been reported 7 but a systematic evaluation is lacking given the paucity of data on the exact prevalence and reasons for an acute myocardial injury during covid-19 our interpretation of hs-ctn elevations has to be discussed on knowledge previously derived from other acute critical conditions foremost severe infections causing sepsis or septic shock 70 in an investigation on hs-ctnt in setting of severe infection median concentrations of hs-ctnt were found to increase from 144 ngl in sepsis to 526 ngl in severe sepsis and 641 ngl in septic shock 70 likewise the prevalence of hs-ctnt  uln increased from 516 in sepsis to 804  in septic shock 70 very similar to covid-19 mild elevations of hs-ctnt were associated with a high mortality rate at 30 days 71 however the risk associated with myocardial injury at baseline persisted over 5 years after the index event suggesting a major prognostic role of pre-existing structural heart disease on long-term outcomes similar to sars-cov-2 infection an impairment of right and left ventricular function on echocardiography was common during other severe infections and there was a clear association between myocardial injury cardiac overload or hemodynamic stress as indicated by natriuretic peptides and inflammatory response 72 significant elevations of hs-ctn have been demonstrated following rapid atrial pacing irrespective the presence of inducible myocardial ischemia 73 in an experimental human model that utilized the trans-cardiac production of lactate for objective evidence of myocardial ischemia hs-ctnt increased in the absence of cad and lactate suggesting that tachycardia itself is capable to induce an acute myocardial injury likewise administration of catecholamines was found to release hs-ctnt in healthy volunteers 74 other mechanisms that have been related to the release of ctn include respiratory failure due to severe hypoxemia sepsis acute kidney failure hypertension or hypotension bradycardia fever anemia and many other causes 61 63 acute mi with or without covid-19 represents a life-threatening condition that requires adjunctive medical therapies such as potent antiplatelet drugs and monitoring to anticipate complications however the enhanced infectious potency in humans 75 mandates a fundamental risk assessment to carefully weigh the relative advantages against disadvantages of treating cardiovascular disease while preventing the risk of sars-cov-2 transmission in patients with suspected acs without st-segment elevation or in the absence of hemodynamic or rhythm instability and when covid-19 cannot be ruled-out due to suspicious clinical presentation the personal recommendation of the author is to obtain nasopharyngeal swabs for real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay and if available to perform a ct lung scan while waiting for the pcr result covid-19-associated pneumonia provides a typical picture that is characterized by bilateral lung infiltrates glass ground opacities consolidation reticular pattern and the so-called crazy paving pattern 10 60 the sensitivity of ct is reported as high as 9799 and is superior that of rt-pcr 76 the ct scan could ideally be performed as a multi-detector ct angiography providing additional information on coronary anatomy and on the presence of pulmonary embolism since elevations of d-dimer are not uncommon 7 60 and values exceeding the twosixfold of the uln are associated with high mortality 45 60 76 77 regarding the measurement of cardiac biomarkers the american college of cardiology acc has released statements against the liberal use of troponin in covid-19 78 given the frequency and non-specific nature of abnormal troponin results among patients with covid-19 clinicians are advised to measure cardiac troponin only if acute myocardial infarction is suspected on clinical grounds 78 the european society of cardiology esc expands these recommendations by restricting the measurement of cardiac troponin ti concentrations to patients with suspected type 1 mi because this infarct type is more likely to benefit from adjunctive antiplatelet therapies and early revascularization therapies personal communication paper under revision moreover in order to reduce the length of stay in an ed and to dedicate monitoring capacities for other critically diseased patients accelerated rapid rule-out andor rule-in of mi seem to be particularly helpful 79 real world evidence suggests that patient disposition may be completed within 23 h without an increase of adverse outcomes compared to standard protocols 80 81 use of echocardiography or coronary angiography should be restricted to those patients in whom these procedures would be expected to meaningfully affect outcomes 78 timing of invasive coronary angiography depends on individual estimation of anticipated risk of death heart failure or other infarct-related complications factors that are supposed to favor an immediate or early coronary angiography under full protection of medical staff include stemi high risk non-st segment elevation mi as suggested by either unstable hemodynamics dynamic st segment changes rhythm instability or a very high clinical score as recommended in 2015 esc guidelines 79 cardiac troponin values should be interpreted as continuous variables since risk of death and benefits from an early invasive strategy incline with increasing values 82 83 it is unclear whether the benefit of revascularization outweighs the potential disadvantages of contamination of medical staff in patients with small-to-intermediate elevations of hs-ctn or whether a yet unsettled more refined risk stratification is required to identify those patients who are likely to benefit most 83 hence patients with nstemi at lower risk should be managed according to local expertise and capability to deliver echocardiography and invasive procedures effectively to the patient without exposing the medical staff to an increased risk of contamination 8487 it has long been known that patients with chronic heart failure chf are at increased risk for adverse consequences of seasonal influenza 88 and other causes of pneumonia 89 conversely infections and in particular pneumonia are frequent triggers of heart failure exacerbations 90 of note influenza vaccination decreases mortality in chf patients and the beneficial effects of repetitive influenza vaccinations may even exceed those of guideline-directed pharmacotherapy 91 severe coronavirus infections such as with sars-cov-2 have been shown to result in a more severe course of disease in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease including heart failure 92 thus it is not surprising that covid-19 is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities 7 93 yet likely due to the lower prevalence of known chf in china there is still limited specific information on patients with preexisting heart failure nevertheless some early reports 9 indicate that covid-19 associated myocardial injury s below is more frequent in patients with heart failure and other cardiovascular comorbidities an obvious reason for an elevated troponin level could be acute coronary syndrome that obviously may also occur in covid-19 patients and which is likely to be underdiagnosed due to reluctance for invasive management s above however the high proportion of typically rather moderately increased high sensitive troponin levels in hospitalized covid-19 patients renders other explanations more likely including acute myocarditis due to sars-cov-2 or myocardial damage due to proinflammatory cytokines cytokine storm ace2 as a potential receptor for coronavirus infection s above is highly expressed in cardiomyocytes and in vascular pericytes 94 thus it seems plausible that sars-cov-2 may directly cause viral myocarditis with associated cell death and subsequent myocardial injury as measured by increased troponin levels indeed the first still anecdotal autopsy and endomyocardial biopsy reports describe evidence for an acute lymphocytic myocarditis 95 96 however the sars-cov-2 genome could not be detected in the myocardium of several of these early cases indicating that other mechanisms of myocardial injury must be involved at least in a subset of patients with myocardial injury another attractive hypothesis how myocardial injury in the context of covid-19 may be explained is a hyperinflammatory state where dysregulated cytokines mediate cardiomyocyte stress and ultimately cell death such a cytokine storm is a well-known 97 while underappreciated syndrome complicating sepsis in up to 4 of cases 98 its clinical characteristics include multiorgan failure associated with persistent fever and lymphopenia as well as high levels of ferritin and several cytokines such as interleukin-6 for example elevated interleukin-6 il-6 levels closely correlate with mortality in sepsis and il-6 has been shown to directly impair contractile function of cardiomyocytes 99 similarly lymphopenia and excessively elevated ferritin and interleukin-6 levels have been demonstrated in severe cases of covid-19 which also revealed myocardial injury with increased high sensitive troponin multiple clinical trials are underway which test antiviral agents potentially effective against sars-cov-2 such as remdesivir and several antivirals previously shown to be effective eg in hiv infections reviewed in 100 as myocardial injury is associated with a dramatically worsened outcome in covid-19 the question arises whether therapy should also be specifically aimed at the prevention of myocardial damage andor hyperinflammation indeed the limited experience with inhibition of the cytokine storm by immunosuppression points towards this possibility for example interleukin-1 blockade by anakinra has been shown to reduce mortality in sepsis with hyperinflammation 101 similarly tocilizumab an interleukin-6 receptor blocking antibody shows early promise in covid-19 in a non-randomized trial involving 20 patients crp levels and oxygen levels were almost normalized within a few days 102 other promising targets include jak inhibitors such as baricitinib 103 immunoglobulins or fingolimod finally it has even been proposed that angiotensin receptors blockers eg losartan may not only be not harmful s above in covid-19 but in fact beneficial as they upregulate ace2 which could ameriolate tissue damage due to sars-cov-2 104 data on removal of cytokines by adsorbent polymer beads cytosorb are sparse coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a pandemic after an outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus occurred in wuhan china meanwhile it has spread throughout the world and is associated with mortality rates between 1 to about 5 cardiovascular disease is an important risk indicator for adverse outcomes and covid-19 might affect the cardiovascular system directly angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 has been shown to be a coreceptor for viral entry downregulating ace2 with cardiovascular consequences cardiovascular disease with dyspnea as a prime symptom like in heart failure myocardial ischemia or hypertensive emergency is an important differential diagnosis should not be ignored in covid-19 and needs to be recognized as an important indicator of poor outcome while there is no evidence for changing cardiovascular therapy a complete cardiovascular workup is necessary in covid-19 patients and in particular in patients with cardio-respiratory symptoms and even in acute respiratory distress syndrome in turn cardiopulmonary symptoms should not distract physicians from an unbiased work-up of cardiovascular conditions as these patients could suffer from life-threatening cardiovascular conditions in the absence of covid-19 healthcare providers in high middle and low income countries need to be aware of the importance of cardiovascular disease in patients with sars and covid-19 infections by providing optimal cardiovascular care  covid19 and hypertensionevidence and practical management guidance from the hope asia network kazuomi kario yuji morisawa apichard sukonthasarn yuda turana yookchin chia sungha park tzungdau wang chenhuan chen jam tay chin yan li jiguang wang   the infectious disease caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 sarscov2 covid19 broke out in wuhan china and spread to almost every country in the world millions of people have been infected many have died and everyday life has changed completely the disease is accompanied by range of different symptoms figure 1 rapidly accumulating data show that prognosis for patients with covid19 is good in those with mild disease but severe cases show relatively asymptomatic early progression followed by rapid worsening after symptom onset culminating in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and significant disease manifestations figure 2 the presence of sarscov2 has been detected in multiple organs on autopsy including the pharynx lungs heart liver brain and kidneys highlighting the multiorgan tropism of this virus
1

 early clinical experience suggested that older age and the presence of a number of comorbidities including hypertension cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus and chronic respiratory disease increased the risk of death in patients with covid19
2
 
3
 in addition the reninangiotensin aldosterone ras system specifically the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 protein has been identified as playing an important role in facilitating entry of coronaviruses including sarscov2 into target cells especially in the lungs
4
 
5
 therefore it has been suggested that angiotensin receptor blockers arbs and ace inhibitors which affect ace2 expression may influence the susceptibility to and severity of infection with sarscov2

11

 hypertension is very common affecting an estimated 139 billion individuals worldwide
12
 and the prevalence of hypertension increases with age affecting approximately 70 of older adults
13
 in addition ras inhibitors such as ace inhibitors and arbs are recommended and widely used for the treatment of hypertension
14
 
15
 
16
 however hypertension is not a single clinical entity but it instead manifests as a number of different phenotypes in asians the disease is characterized by salt sensitivity high rates of masked hypertension exaggerated morning bp surge and nocturnal hypertension
17
 nearly half of all patients with hypertension worldwide 44 live in south or east asia
18

 the hope asia network was established in 2016 and is a member of the world hypertension league
19
 
20
 the mission of the hope asia network is to improve the management of hypertension and organ protection toward achieving zero cardiovascular events in asia
19
 
20
 this has become even more relevant in the current pandemic with high rates of infection in several asian countries this guidance from the hope asia network summarizes the latest findings on covid19 and hypertension including evidencebased recommendations for the management of hypertension during the current pandemic on march 20 2020 the italian institute of health announced that there had been 3200 covid19 deaths in italy
21
 the patients who died had an average age of 785 years median 80 years range 31103 years and 987 had at least one comorbidity
21
 hypertension was a common comorbidity in italian cases affecting 738 of patients 52 of whom were taking arbs or ace inhibitors
21
 however there are number of factors that could potentially confound a possible relationship between hypertension and severe covid19 table 1
22
 
23
 
24
 
25
 
26
 
27
 the first is age both severe covid19 and hypertension are common in the elderly in addition the identified risk factors table 1 are generally associated with aging andor vascular disorders both of which are common in patients with hypertension therefore the risk of developing severe covid19 is more likely to be due to underlying vascular endothelial dysfunction andor organ damage than high blood pressure bp per se ace2 receptors are expressed by endothelial cells
28
 and postmortem examinations have detected the presence of viral infection in endothelial cells
29

 the spike protein on the surface of sarscov2 binds to the extracellular domain of transmembrane ace2 with s protein priming by transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 to gain entry to host cells figure 3

30
 ace2 plays a regulatory role in the ras converting angiotensin i ang i into angiotensin 19 ang 19 or angiotensin ii ang ii into angiotensin 17 ang 17
31
 
32
 currently available data reflect a possible role for ace2 in heart failure myocardial infarction hypertension and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes mellitus and preclinical investigations suggest that activation of ace2 might have the potential to protect against hypertension and cardiovascular disease
31
 
33
 
34
 
35
 in addition angiotensin 17 appears to counteract the negative effects of ang ii attenuating inflammation suppressing vascular permeability and having vasorelaxant effects
36
 
37
 
38
 furthermore ace2 in the lungs and the reninangiotensin system has been shown to play a role in the pulmonary manifestations of coronavirus infection
39

 interaction of ang ii with angiotensin type 1 receptors at1r activates a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 adam17 on the cell membrane via phosphorylation
40
 in turn adam17 cleaves the precursors of tumor necrosis factor tnf and interleukin il6 receptor il6r in the cell membrane to release tnf and soluble il6r
41
 tnf activates the nuclear transcription factor system nfb to induce the production of various inflammatory cytokines including il6 figure 4
42
 this represents a potential mechanism for the cytokine storm seen in some patients with covid19 and highlights the potential for agents blocking cytokine pathways especially the il6stat3 axis in managing covid19related cytokine storm
43

 the fact that the sarscov2 virus uses ace2 as a mechanism to enter and infect cells meant that there was concern that cells with high ace2 expression would be most susceptible to infection with sarscov2 given that arb and ace inhibitors have been shown experimentally to increase expression of ace2 on cell membranes
28
 
44
 there was much discussion about the potential for higher infection rates and more severe disease in patients being treated with these agents despite the theoretical possibility that use of ras inhibitors increases the risk of infection with sarscov2 and the severity of covid19 illness analyses including patients from the current pandemic indicate that this does not seem to be the case table 2 the effect of hypertension or therapy with ace inhibitors or arbs has been evaluated in at least three published studies to date table 2
45
 
46
 
47
 reynolds et al looked at history of antihypertensive usage in 12 594 patients undergoing covid19 testing in new york usa
47
 they did not find any association between the use of ace inhibitors arbs betablockers calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics and the likelihood of a positive or negative result on covid19 testing
47
 also in the united states mehta and colleagues failed to find any significant association between the use of ace inhibitors or arbs and covid19 test positivity
46
 similar findings were reported in a population casecontrol study from italy
45

 data from four studies published by early may 2020 also failed to find a significant association between ras inhibitor use and worse outcomes in patients with covid19 table 2
48
 
49
 
50
 in one retrospective case series the proportion of patients using ace inhibitors or arbs did not differ significantly between those with severe vs nonsevere covid19 or between survivors and nonsurvivors
48
 however the inhospital covid19 mortality rate was higher in patients with vs without hypertension 21 vs 11
48
 in the other studies death rates for patients taking ace inhibitors andor arbs were actually lower than those in patients not receiving these antihypertensive therapies
49
 
50
 one of the studies from china reported that levels of the inflammatory markers high sensitivity creactive protein and procalcitonin were significantly lower in patients with hypertension who were vs were not receiving ace inhibitors or arbs
49

 there are two possible mechanisms of cardiovascular damage in covid19 the first is direct viral infection of myocardial and vascular cells and the other is a systemic inflammatory reaction or cytokine storm figure 5 myocardial injury at the time of admission or due to disease progression is a strong indicator of poor prognosis in patients with covid19 troponin is a highly sensitive and wellknown marker of myocardial injury a systematic review and metaanalysis of data published between 1 december 2019 and 27 march 2020 including 4189 patients from 28 studies showed a significant trend for higher levels of cardiac biomarkers in patients with more severe covid19
51
 on metaregression analysis the only factor significantly associated with higher levels of cardiac injury biomarkers was the presence of hypertension p  03 in addition more severe covid19 markedly increased the risk of acute cardiac injury risk ratio vs mild disease 599 95 confidence interval ci 3041180 p  001 in turn the risk of covid19related death was significantly increased in the presence of acute cardiac injury risk ratio 385 95 ci 213696
51
 another analysis also reported that patients with severe covid19 had significantly higher levels of troponin than those without severe disease standardized mean difference 256 ngl 95 ci 68445 ngl
52

 early data from wuhan china showed that 12 of patients admitted to hospital with covid19 had acute cardiac injury
53
 subsequent analyses investigated associations between underlying cardiovascular disease or myocardial injury and mortality in hospitalized patients with covid19 n  187
23
 patients with vs without myocardial injury defined as elevated troponin levels were significantly older 74 vs 60 years p  001 and more likely to have hypertension 598 vs 234 p  001
23
 
25
 during hospitalization those with myocardial injury had higher rates of ards 585 vs 147 p  001 acute renal injury 85 vs 03 p  001 and death 512 vs 45 p  001 the appearance of myocardial injury increased the risk of death by 426fold compared to patients without myocardial damage independent of cardiac function based on ecg and echocardiography findings figure 6

 the 2 gml cutoff had 92 sensitivity and 83 specificity for predicting inhospital mortality and therefore might be a useful biomarker for predicting outcome and informing treatment decisions in patients with covid19 the cumulative rate of thromboembolic events in patients admitted to hospital in milan italy with covid19 n  388 was 21 28 of those in intensive care and 7 for those not in intensive care despite use of thromboprophylaxis in all patients admitted to the intensive care unit and threequarters of those treated on a general ward
56
 about half of all thromboembolic events occurred within 24 hours of hospitalization and 2 of patients developed dic
56
 a consensus statement on the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolismassociated covid19 infection has been published
57
 this recommends that patients with covid19 undergo assessment for the risk of venous thromboembolism and bleeding and are monitored regularly to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism and the use of strategies pharmacologic andor mechanical to prevent venous thromboembolism
57

 key points regarding the clinical management of covid19 particularly in patients with hypertension based on evidence published before may 5 2020 are shown in table 4 data that have been rapidly compiled during the pandemic to date indicate that there are a number of factors and biomarkers that can be used to identify patients with covid19 who are at high risk of more severe disease and adverse outcomes including death age seems to be the most important risk factor especially for covid19related death and hypertension is the most common comorbidity in covid19positive deceased patients
21
 other comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases smoking chronic lung disease chronic kidney disease and a suppressed immune system also increase the risks associated with covid19 infection especially when multiple comorbidities exist in the same patient
21
 thorough history taking and baseline assessments are therefore important another important screening tool is oxygen saturation which indicates severe disease if 94 on admission

58
 the relevance of ability to tolerate hypoxia was highlighted in an analysis from china showing that covid19 patients of highaltitude origin had a lower mortality risk than those from lower altitudes
59
 determination of relevant biomarkers especially troponin and ddimer provides an indication of myocardial injury and thrombotic risk and can help inform appropriate treatment strategies for nonhospitalized patients with covid19 ongoing management of comorbid conditions is essential to minimize risk this includes lifestyle factors such as diet and sleep along with maintaining regular medications eg antihypertensives and antidiabetics patients with hypertension on current therapy with ace inhibitors or arbs can continue treatment without any negative effects on covid19 outcomes ras inhibitors are particularly beneficial in patients who have heart failure or renal disease because they have a positive effect on prognosis for older patients with hypertension and no other comorbidities and risk factors calcium channel antagonists might be a good option for antihypertensive therapy maintaining good glycaemic control is also important because this might help reduce the risk of infection with sarscov2 and the severity of covid19
60
 in addition regular monitoring of home bp will help to ensure the achievement and maintenance of bp targets in patients with hypertension lockdown requirements could impact on the ability of individuals to get regular exercise regular exercise is important for maintaining health status
61
 and to counteract the negative consequences of cardiovascular metabolic and respiratory diseases
62
 even if unable to get outside continuing some form of homebased exercise would be beneficial especially in older adults
63
 maintaining regular exercise could help to ensure that the current viral pandemic does not contribute to the worldwide obesity epidemic which in turn increases the rate of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities
64
 ensuring that the world population is not burdened by high rates of noncommunicable diseases might help lessen the impact of future pandemics given that patients with comorbidities tend to fare poorly during an infectious disease pandemic
64
 another potential benefit of physical activity is its ability to stimulate immune function
65
 something that is highly relevant during a global pandemic health care professionals should also be aware of the potential noninfectious impacts of covid19 for example noninfected individuals might be at risk of developing stressrelated physical health conditions such as gastrointestinal disturbances and cardiovascular disease and psychological disturbances such as anxiety and depression strict lockdown and social distancing rules are being enforced in many countries to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus in addition a large proportion of elective or nonessential procedures have been postponed or canceled to allow health care systems to cope with the influx of infectious disease cases this has created a requirement for a large proportion of health consultations to be conducted remotely telemedicine strategies are ideally suited to facilitating patient management in the absence of facetoface consultations and the value of this approach which has otherwise been slow to be widely used in clinical practice has become clear
66
 
67
 one of the hidden blessings of the covid19 pandemic may be the widespread adoption of telemedicine approaches to improve patient management outofoffice bp monitoring is a recommended approach for the diagnosis and management of hypertension

 therefore this field of medicine is better placed than many to be able to continue to effectively manage patients during a global pandemic new information and communication technologybased home bp monitoring devices that perform automatic fixedinterval bp measurement during sleep and store or transmit the data could facilitate a novel approach to patient management
76
 validated wearable technologies for evaluation of home bp
77
 
78
 might also be useful for patient monitoring and management during the covid19 outbreak telemedicinebased strategies for managing bp were implemented and used effectively during the aftermath of the great east japan earthquake and tsunami in march 2011
79
 highlighting their potential for use during the covid19 pandemic to ensure that patients with hypertension have wellcontrolled bp this has the potential to help mitigate the negative effects of hypertension on prognosis in patients with covid19 patients with hypertension are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality if they become infected with sarscov2 although this is confounded by other factors such as age and vascular disorders however all usual antihypertensive therapy including ras inhibitors should continue physicians need to take a holistic approach to patient management due the wide range of possible complications and biomarkers can provide important prognostic information overall multidisciplinary management of covid19 based on a rapidly growing body of evidence will help ensure the best possible outcomes for patients including those with risk factors such as hypertension all authors report no potential conflicts of interest in relation to this article  managing hypertension during the covid-19 pandemic sunil nadar k muzahir tayebjee h michael stowasser james byrd brian   we are currently in the midst of a covid-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the global shutdown with more than a third of the worlds population facing some form of lockdown or quarantine measures is on an unprecedented scale and will no doubt be etched in history at the time of writing more than 2 million people have been diagnosed to have the infection with more than 50000 deaths worldwide it is expected that an even larger number are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and undiagnosed during this time while the worlds focus is on the novel coronavirus there is a danger that other illnesses might be overlooked members of the public are being urged not to attend emergency departments for non-urgent matters with the dual intention of protecting healthcare workers whilst freeing resources to treat the covid-19 patients indeed hospitals have reported a decrease in the number of patients attending emergency departments with myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents 1 2 it is likely that patients are concerned about contracting the virus while attending the hospital and are staying away as there are reports of delayed presentation of patients with acute myocardial infarctions 3 it is imperative that these other life-threatening conditions are not forgotten while we deal with the coronavirus in addition to the acute conditions management of stable chronic illnesses such as hypertension and diabetes may also be affected many hospitals worldwide have cancelled all in-person elective patient care including routine outpatient clinics and moved towards telemedicine as part of social distancing measures doing so also preserves resources to help tackle supply chain problems and other challenges created by a surge in patients infected by the novel coronavirus even in these circumstances it is important that blood pressure and blood glucose levels are monitored regularly this is particularly important as patients with diabetes and hypertension may be at higher risk for complications of covid-19 4 early data from china and the united states suggest that hypertension appears to be the most prevalent comorbidity among patients admitted with covid-19 being present in at least 3049 of them 4 5 hypertensive patients who develop covid-19 are more likely to be admitted to hospital than normotensive individuals 6 the presence of hypertension also seems to be associated with poorer outcomes from covid-19 7 it not clear whether it is hypertension per se that contributes to the increased morbidity or whether patients with hypertension have more underlying health problems as data have confirmed that patients with multiple comorbidities are likely to fare worse 8 we should bear in mind though that these are retrospective data from patients admitted with covid-19 and therefore can only suggest association and not causation nevertheless the interaction of sars-cov-2 virus with ace2 in the endothelial cell 9 does raise the possibility that endothelial dysfunction which commonly occurs in hypertension 10 may exacerbate the effect of the virus a major problem during a pandemic with a hitherto-unknown organism is early conflicting data that can cause uncertainty and confusion in the management of these patients it has been shown that sars-cov-2 binds to cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme ace 2 receptor 9 thereby gaining entry to the cells concern was therefore raised at the start of the pandemic that ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs medications that are commonly used for hypertension and heart failure could have a potential deleterious effect 11 as ace2 is widely expressed in the cardiovascular system and is up regulated by these drugs in some tissues in a subset of animal models 12 13 these initial publications led to a considerable amount of discussion and debate with the counter argument being that ace inhibitors and arbs have been shown to protect from lung injury in experimental models of coronavirus infections 14 these agents have also previously been demonstrated to reduce systemic inflammation and could potentially reduce the degree of multi-organ failure seen in severe covid-19 15 it was also considered that uncontrolled blood pressure or heart failure that could ensue as a result of discontinuation of these therapies and could contribute to morbidity in infected patients guidance was promptly issued advising that these drugs not be discontinued 16 17 subsequent data have raised the possibility that patients treated with ace inhibitors or arbs do indeed have a better outcome with the crucial caveat that the possibility of unmeasured confounding and bias precludes drawing cause-effect conclusions from the clinical studies available thus far a recent retrospective study from china comparing outcomes on hospitalised patients with covid-19 with and without ace inhibitors or arbs for hypertension has suggested that in the former all-cause mortality was lower adjusted hr 042 95 ci 019092 p  003 18 another retrospective study from china showed that fewer patients on ace inhibitors or arbs had severe disease as compared with those who were not on these drugs 235 and 48 respectively the ace inhibitorarb-treated group also had significantly higher cd3 and cd8 t cells and a trend towards lower il-6 levels 19 more recent analyses preprints though have suggested that after adjustment for certain likely confounders the signal for improved outcomes is no longer as strong as first believed 20 in the end the effects of treatment with ace inhibitors or arbs will only be positively identified through rcts which are ongoing 21 there is also mounting concern about possible thromboembolic complications of the virus and a possible procoagulable state 22 various factors which can lead to a hypercoagulable state such as inflammation hypoxia immobilisation dehydration and diffuse intravascular coagulation have been described in covid-19 in addition hypertension has also known to be associated with a hypercoagulable state 23 and it is possible that an interaction between these two conditions might lead to a worsening thrombotic milieu we are still learning more about this new virus and information continues to mount in the meantime it would be prudent to continue the guideline-based management of all chronic conditions and cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension healthcare practitioners need to ensure that patients are appropriately advised and have access to their drugs patients should be made aware that despite the lockdown pharmacies and hospitals are still open indeed the british heart foundation has recently issued a notice reminding the public not to ignore chest pain and seek help immediately as they also report a 50 drop in patients presenting with a myocardial infarction since the start of the pandemic 22 general practitioners and family physicians are still available for consultations even if it is over the telephone patients should also be encouraged to monitor their blood pressure at home be adherent with treatment and adopt healthy lifestyles in many countries individuals are allowed to go out to exercise while ensuring they maintain social distancing and take all the other necessary precautions as advised by their public health authorities this current pandemic has brought about profound changes in the social and economic lives of many it has also changed the way healthcare is being delivered and prioritised even when social restrictions are relaxed it is hard to imagine that things would quickly if ever go back to how they were before the pandemic whilst we get used to the new normal way of life we should remember that other diseases and illness are still out there and still need our care perhaps this is a time for much of the control of chronic illnesses to go back to the community and the patients we have to ensure that patients with chronic illnesses are not forgotten in our fight against sars-cov-2 and do not end up as collateral damage  the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in coronavirus infection  current considerations during the pandemic john augoustides g   the prevalence of coexisting hypertension has been estimated to be in the 10-25 range amongst patients presenting with covid-1911 12 13 14 the coexisting conditions such as hypertension older age diabetes cardiovascular disease have all been reported to be more common in patients with severe covid-19 requiring intensive care14 15 16 17 the comorbidities including hypertension have also been significantly associated with adverse outcomes in covid-19 such as adult respiratory distress syndrome cardiovascular compromise and mortality14 15 16 17 18
 since the comorbidity of hypertension has been associated with severe covid-19 and its consequences the question has emerged about the roles of raas inhibitors such as acei and arbs in the pathogenesis of severe covid-19 given that these raas inhibitors are common therapies for hypertension and that they may up-regulate the expression of ace2 the clinical concern has been formulated that therapy with these agents may increase the risk and severity of coronavirus infection19 20 21 22 there is currently insufficient evidence to address this question in a definitive fashion1

14 the published literature both in preclinical and clinical studies has conflicting results about the potential for harm with respect to the interactions between raas inhibitors and coronavirus 19 further trials will likely focus on the current evidence gaps related to this question in severe covid-19 including mechanisms the prevalence of raas inhibitors and careful correlation of this prevalence with clinical outcomes1

18 19
 although hypertension and consequent exposure to acei and arbs are likely common in severe covid-19 this association does link to causality as outlined above23

24 there may also be confounding by association here in that patients with severe covid-19 are more likely to be hypertensive diabetic and older this comorbidity burden rather than the associated drug therapy may better explain the adverse outcomes in coronavirus infection17 18 19
 in contrast animal studies have clearly documented that ace2 may have a protective role in acute lung injury related to coronavirus infection25

26 functional ace2 typically converts angiotensin ii to angiotensin 1-7 thereby reducing the adverse effects of angiotensin ii via the angiotensin type i receptor in the lung that lead to acute lung injury1

21 since therapy with acei andot arbs also reduces angiotensin ii levels it follows that these agents may also protect against acute lung injury in the setting of covid-191

21

27
 the evidence for the benefits ace2 in coronavirus infection has prompted further investigations the exogenous administration of recombinant ace2 may not only bind circulating coronavirus to acute viral load but also could degrade angiotensin ii to down-regulate activation of the raas and protect against acute lung injury in covid-191

22

28 this fascinating dual function of ace2 has prompted a pilot clinical trial to evaluate recombinant ace2 in patients with covid-19 full details available at wwwclinicaltrialsgov with trial identifier nct04287686 last accessed march 31st 2020 the potential therapeutic effects of arbs in covid-19 have also triggered a set of clinical trials full details available at wwwclinicaltrialsgov with trial identifiers nct04312009 and nct04311177 last accessed march 31st 2020 furthermore there are clinical trials in progress investigating the effects of acei in patients with covid-19 full details available at wwwclinicaltrialsgov with trial identifiers nct04322786 and nct04318418 last accessed march 31st 2020 these trials will likely provide much needed evidence to guide therapy with raas inhibitors in patients throughout the clinical spectrum of covid-19 patients with severe covid-19 may also develop vasoplegic shock with or without concomitant sepsis30 in the initial wave of covid-19 in seattle patients with cardiovascular compromise seldom had superinfection suggesting that the cardiovascular instability was mostly due to the consequences of viral infection6 furthermore in this patient cohort echocardiography also rarely identified ventricular dysfunction although myocarditis is a possibility in this disease30 this latest data from the pandemic in the united states suggests that vasoplegic shock from the effects of the coronavirus is a likely clinical presentation in severe covid-196
 a possible etiology for this low systemic vascular tone in this clinical setting may be the disordered function of the raas1

21 the first possibility is that patients on acei and arbs may be at greater risk for vasoplegia in the setting of an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response akin to what we typically observe in perioperative cardiothoracic and vascular practice4

5 a second possibility is that the severe alveolar endothelial damage from adult respiratory distress syndrome may disrupt the function of angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 interfering with the hydrolysis of angiotensin i to form angiotensin ii1 2 3 the resulting deficiency of angiotensin ii leads to loss of systemic vascular tone2

3 furthermore the resulting excess of angiotensin i also aggravates vasoplegia through the enhanced production of nitric oxide and bradykinin2

3 the possibility therefore exists that vasoplegic shock in severe covid-19 may be due to dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with consequent angiotensin ii deficiency suggesting that exogenous administration of this vasopressor may have a unique role in this clinical scenario2
 the status quo with respect to acei and arbs in covid-19 can be confusing to clinicians in the front lines of patient care during the pandemic given the possibilities for both benefit and harm14

15 this priority for clinical guidance during the coronavirus virus has prompted recent statements from multiple professional societies including the canadian cardiovascular society the european society of hypertension the international society of hypertension the european society of cardiology and american college of cardiology13

14 in summary the expert consensus from all these professional societies is that patients with covid-19 should continue their regular home blood antihypertensive regimen even if it includes acei and arbs14 in patients with covid-19 who develop shock the vasodilator regimen with raas inhibitors can be discontinued14
 although not specifically addressed in these multiple professional guidelines the roles of rescue therapy for vasoplegic shock can also be considered in refractory cases including angiotensin ii2

4

5 furthermore in treatment-resistant cases of copvid-19 the mechanisms for cardiogenic shock and the supportive roles of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be entertained early as these considerations can often lead to therapeutic breakthroughs29 30 31
 the spectrum of severe covid-19 includes significant disruption of the raas with significant implications for organ dysfunction vascular tone as well as therapy with acei and arbs although clinical trials are in progress to close the current evidence gaps the current expert consensus has recommended that in most cases existing therapy with acei and arbs be continued in the setting of circulatory shock these agents may be discontinued and early consideration of therapies for medical and mechanical rescue may be lifesaving the management of patients through this pandemic must also consider infection control to prevent further viral transmission none  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in lung diseases keiji kuba yumiko imai josef penninger m   for many decades the roles of the renin-angiotensin system ras have been studied in physiology and multiple disorders in particular cardiovascular diseases 1 2 angiotensin ii ang ii a key effector peptide of the ras exerts multiple biological functions including the vasoconstriction and sodium balance involved in blood pressure homeostasis angiotensin-converting enzyme ace plays a central role in generating ang ii from angiotensin i ang i 3 4 figure 1
 and ace inhibitors or ang ii receptor blockers exhibit beneficial effects in cardiovascular diseases capillary blood vessels in the lung are a major site of high-level expression of ace 5 thus the lung is an important organ in generating circulating ang ii acting as a classical circulation-borne endocrine system in contrast to this endocrine ras model numerous studies have highlighted the importance of local rass 6 for example an increase in endothelial ace expression in the muscularized intra-acinar arteries of lungs was shown both in patients with pulmonary hypertension 7 and in rats with hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension 8 in addition to ace other components of the ras are expressed in lungs including renin 9 angiotensinogen 10 and ang ii receptors 11 in 2000 ace2 a homologue of ace was identified its discovery instantaneously added a new complexity to the ras 12 13 although ace2 functions similarly to ace as a carboxypeptidase ace2 has a different substrate specificity 12 13 14 shown by in vitro analyses using recombinant ace2 protein whereas ace removes dipeptides from the c-terminus of peptide substrates generating the octapeptide ang ii from the decapeptide ang i 3 15 ace2 cleaves a single residue from ang ii generating angiotensin-19 12 13 and a single residue from ang ii to generate angiotensin-17 12 genetic inactivation of ace using homologous recombination results in a phenotype characterized by spontaneous hypotension reduced male fertility and kidney malformation 16 by contrast targeted disruption of murine ace2 resulted in increased systemic ang ii levels and impaired cardiac contractility in aged mice 17 loss of ace on an ace2 background reversed this cardiac phenotype 17 thus ace2 appears to be a negative regulator of the ras and counterbalances the function of ace figure 1 the importance of the ras in lung diseases has recently re-emerged since the identification of ace2 as a severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus receptor during several months of 2003 sars  a newly identified illness  spread rapidly from china throughout the world causing more than 800 deaths 18 19 a novel coronavirus was identified as the sars pathogen which triggered atypical pneumonia characterized by high fever and severe dyspnea 18 19 the death rate following sars coronavirus exposure approached almost 10 of infected people owing to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards ards is the most severe form of acute lung injury and is characterized by pulmonary oedema accumulation of inflammatory cells and severe hypoxia 20 21 clinical as well as experimental animal studies have implicated ace in the pathogenesis of ards 22 23 24 ace2 is expressed in the lungs of healthy and diseased humans 25 and recent ards and sars studies have shown that ace2 protects murine lungs from severe acute injury 26 27 importantly these experiments also revealed that ace2 is an essential receptor for sars infections in vitro and in vivo 27 28 in this review we review the role of the ras in particular of the sars receptor ace2 in lung diseases focusing on pulmonary hypertension pulmonary fibrosis and acute lung injury the possible applications of blocking the ras andor modulating ace2 for the treatment of lung diseases are discussed pulmonary hypertension is characterized by elevations in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance caused by multiple etiologies including primary pulmonary hypertension chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd high altitude or pulmonary embolism abnormal pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary vascular remodeling are major pathological features seen in most forms of pulmonary hypertension 29 30 although ang ii is well known as a potent vasopressor peptide in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension ang ii seems to play a role in pulmonary vascular remodeling rather than pulmonary vasoconstriction in in vitro cell culture models ang ii has been shown to directly cause growthproliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells largely through ang ii type i at1 rather than through type ii at2 receptors 31 figure 1 in pulmonary hypertension in vivo the expression of ace is increased in the endothelial layer of small as well as elastic pulmonary arteries 7 32 in addition in hypoxic but not monocrotaline-treated 33 pulmonary hypertensive rats both ang ii binding and the number of at1 receptors are increased 34 35 in human patients an association between an ace insertiondeletion polymorphism the d allele of the human ace gene confers increased ace activity in plasma and pulmonary hypertension has been reported this association is however controversial for instance one study showed that the ace dd genotype is associated with less right ventricular hypertrophy 36 whereas another reported a correlation between the ace dd genotype and the severity of symptoms 37 pharmacologic treatment of animals with either an ace blocker or an ang ii receptor antagonist inhibited pulmonary vascular remodeling associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension in chronically hypoxic rats or mice 38 39 or in monocrotaline-treated rats 40 by contrast tissue ace-deficient mice which exhibit undetectable lung ace activity but retain 34 of the ace activity in plasma show the same remodeling of pulmonary arterioles as do wild-type mice 41 in addition despite earlier studies of acute ace inhibition 42 43 44 a recent pilot study on patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to copd showed that treatment with the at1 receptor blocker losartan 50 mg showed no statistically significant beneficial effect in terms of pulmonary artery pressure exercise capacity or breathlessness score 45 the discrepancy between hypoxic rat studies and this human trial might be caused by differences in the pathogenesis of hypoxic rats versus patients with copd-related pulmonary hypertension further studies are required to solve these important issues pulmonary fibrosis is a frequent response to insults or injuries to the lung etiologies include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis sarcoidosis irradiation-induced pneumonitis or ards excess deposition of extracellular matrix proteins is a key feature of interstitial fibrosis in the lung the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis includes endothelial and epithelial cell injury influx of inflammatory cells and the production of chemical mediators leading to the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts 46 47 although there are various initiating mechanisms and etiologies the terminal phases of fibrosis are commonly characterized by the proliferation and progressive accumulation of connective tissue replacing normal functional parenchyma ang ii immunoreactivity is also significantly increased within lung fibroblasts macrophages and bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium after irradiation 48 in addition angiotensinogen is produced by fibroblasts from fibrotic but not normal human lung ang ii upregulates the expression of the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-1 which is involved in both the conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and the accumulation of collagen 49 figure 1 an in vivo role for ang ii in pulmonary fibrosis has been implied from animal models with bleomycin- or irradiation-mediated lung injury in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats or mice ace inhibitors or at1 receptor blockers can attenuate epithelial apoptosis interstitial fibrosis and collagen deposition 50 51 52 in irradiation-induced lung fibrosis ace inhibitors attenuate endothelial dysfunction and fibrosis in rats 53 conversely retrospective comparison of the incidence of irradiation-induced lung injury between subjects who took ace inhibitors and those who did not failed to reveal a protective effect 54 however serum concentrations of ace inhibitors used by subjects in the human study would be expected to be considerably less than those achieved in the animal models cited above as there are no published prospective or retrospective studies regarding the use of other ace inhibitors or at1 receptor blockers in human pulmonary fibrosis induced by factors other than irradiation it is therefore still unclear if inhibition of the ras would indeed have beneficial effects on lung fibrosis ards is the most severe form of acute lung injury and affects approximately one million individuals worldwideyear with a mortality rate of at least 3050 20 21 ards can be triggered by multiple diseases such as sepsis aspiration trauma acute pancreatitis or pneumonias following infections with sars coronavirus or avian and human influenza viruses recent cohort studies of ards showed a significant association between an ace insertiondeletion polymorphism and the susceptibility and outcome of ards 23 24 the dd genotype frequency was increased in patients with ards compared with a control cohort 23 in addition the ace dd allele was significantly associated with mortality in the ards group 23 another study showed that patients carrying the ace ii genotype have a significantly increased survival rate 24 thus from the results of inhibitor experiments in rodents 22 and ace allelic correlation studies in humans 23 24 it has been suggested that the ras could play a role in acute lung failure our group has investigated the role of ace2 in ards by using ace2 knockout mice in acid-aspiration-induced ards endotoxin-induced ards and peritoneal sepsis-induced ards ace2 knockout mice exhibited severe disease compared with control mice that express ace2 26 loss of ace2 expression in mutant mice resulted in enhanced vascular permeability increased lung edema neutrophil accumulation and worsened lung function importantly treatment with catalytically active but not enzymatically inactive recombinant ace2 protein improved the symptoms of acute lung injury in wild-type mice as well as in ace2 knockout mice 26 thus ace2 plays a protective role in acute lung injury mechanistically the negative regulation of ang ii levels by ace2 accounts in part for the protective function of ace2 in ards for example at1 receptor inhibitor treatment or additional ace gene deficiency on an ace2 knockout background rescues the severe phenotype of ace2 single mutant mice in acute lung injury 26 in addition ace knockout mice and at1a receptor knockout mice showed improved symptoms of acute lung injury 26 therefore in acute lung injury ace ang ii and at1 receptors function as lung injury-promoting factors 26 55 whereas ace2 protects against lung injury 26 figure 2
 these findings suggest that the beneficial effects of ace inhibitors or at1 receptor blockers in lung injury models induced by bleomycin or irradiation observed in the earlier studies derive largely from their effects on the acute phase of those injuries within a few months following the publication of the sars-cov genome 56 57 ace2 was identified as a potential receptor in cell line studies in vitro 28 ace2 has been demonstrated to bind sars-cov spike and to support syncytia formation the fusion of spike-protein-expressing cells into large multinucleated cells that can also be seen in real sars infections using a mouse sars infection model with ace2 knockout mice our group provided evidence that ace2 is indeed essential for sars infections in vivo 27 when ace2 knockout mice are infected with the sars coronavirus they become resistant to virus infection 27 virus titers from the lung tissues of infected ace2 knockout mice were 105-fold lower than those isolated from the lung of sars-cov-infected wild-type mice 27 the lung histology from ace2 knockout mice challenged with sars coronavirus showed no signs of inflammation 27 whereas some but not all sars-infected wild-type mice displayed mild inflammation with leukocyte infiltration 27 58 thus ace2 is an essential receptor for sars infections in vivo despite many studies on sars-cov the reasons why sars-cov infections trigger severe lung disease with such a high mortality in contrast to other coronaviruses remain a mystery accumulating evidence indicates that severe sars infections are dependent upon the burden of viral replication as well as on the immunopathologic consequences of the host response for review see 59 60 in addition to the aberrant activation of immune systems our own studies have implicated the involvement of the ras in sars pathogenesis firstly ace2 is a critical sars receptor in vivo and secondly ace2 and other components of the ras play a central role in controlling the severity of acute lung failure once the disease process has been initiated 27 figure 2 intriguingly wild-type mice infected with sars-cov showed markedly downregulated ace2 expression in lungs 27 similarly treatment with recombinant sars-spike protein in the absence of any other virus components downregulates ace2 expression in vitro and in vivo 27 thus sars-cov-infected or spike protein-treated wild-type mice resemble ace2 knockout mice and similar to ace2 mutant mice spike-treated wild-type mice show markedly more severe pathology of acute lung injury additionally in spike-treated mice ang ii peptide levels were increased and the worsened ards symptoms could be partially reversed by at1 receptor blocker treatment 27 by contrast spike does not affect the ards symptoms in ace2 knockout mice 27 thus the downregulation of ace2 expression in sars-cov infections might play a causal role in sars pathogenesis especially in disease progression to ards ang ii plays roles in tissue remodeling and fibrotic changes through acting on fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells thereby contributing to the pathogenesis or progression of pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension this notion is strongly supported by the successful treatment of these disease conditions using ace inhibitors or at1 receptor blockers in animal models however pilot clinical trials have failed to observe significant beneficial effects of ace inhibitors on radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis or positive effects of at1 receptor blockers on copd-related pulmonary hypertension recently the critical importance of the ras in the pathogenesis of acute lung disease ie ardsacute lung injury has emerged hypothetically the ras appears to contribute to the initial severity of lung diseases rather than to later stages that define chronic fibrosis and tissue remodeling in line with this notion the dd polymorphism of the ace gene has been associated with the incidence of pneumonias in japanese elderly patients 61 and mortality of ards patients 23 24 importantly ace2 has been identified as a key sars receptor and ace2 protects murine lungs from acute lung injury induced by acid aspiration endotoxin shock peritoneal sepsis or sars spike challenge these findings might provide the opportunity to develop ace2 as a novel drug for ards that develops in emerging lung infectious diseases such as avian influenza a h5n1 62 or other diseases that affect lung function 63 because ace2 is an non-specific protease it would also be interesting to investigate the role of ace2 and its metabolites including angiotensin-17 des-arg9-bradykinin apelin and dynorphin in ards 14 we look forward to the use of angiotensin system-modulating agentsmolecules in particular ace2 as novel therapeutic agents to treat severe acute lung failure a syndrome that currently affects millions of people without any effective drug treatment papers of particular interest published within the annual period of review have been highlighted as of special interest of outstanding interest

throughout china causing serious harm to human health up to april 27 2020 at least 2878196 patients have been confirmed to have covid-19 all over the world of whom 198668 have died 5 the who characterized covid-19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 after it announced that covid-19 in china was a public health emergency of international concern pheic on january 31 2020 67 due to the severe outbreak of covid-19 and its wide-ranging scope strict prevention and control strategies should be implemented in the affected countries and the treatment of infected individuals should receive more attention as reported by the china centers for disease control and prevention approximately 128 of patients with covid-19 have hypertension and 4 of patients have cardiovascular disease cvd the mortality rate of patients with cardiovascular disease is much higher than that of patients without comorbidities 8 growing evidence suggests that combined cardiovascular disease may increase the severity of coronavirus infection and lead to a poor prognosis 9 10 11 12 13 at the same time there is also evidence suggesting that serum levels of cardiac necrosis biomarkers have increased to varying degrees in both mild and severe covid-19 patients suggesting different degrees of myocardial damage 9 10 11 12 13 14 moreover the study found that the markers of myocardial necrosis in severe and deceased covid-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild covid-19 patients suggesting that cardiac damage may be related to poor prognosis 9101213 existing evidence suggests that covid-19 is closely related to cardiovascular disease but the specific interaction between the two is unclear this paper describes the relationship between coronavirus and cardiovascular diseases through a review of the literature and datasets about sars mers and other diseases caused by the human coronavirus hoping to provide some assistance for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 coronaviruses covs are the largest group of viruses belonging to the nidovirales order which includes the coronaviridae arteriviridae and roniviridae families covs are further subdivided into four groups the    and  covs 15 the newly discovered sars-cov-2 belongs to the -covs 2 all covs are enveloped nonsegmented positive-sense rna viruses 15 the most significant feature of covs is the club-shaped spike projections emanating from the surface of the virion therefore cov look like a tiny corona as depicted in studies by cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy prompting the name coronavirus 16 17 18 cov is a respiratory virus that exists widely in nature its natural hosts include humans and other mammals such as pigs dogs cats mice and bats 19 at present seven human coronaviruses hcovs have been discovered in which hcov-229e 20 hcov-nl63 2122 hcov-oc43 23 24 25 hcov-hku1 26 sars-cov 27 28 29 30 and mers-cov 3132 are included in addition to sars-cov-2 recently isolated from the respiratory tracts of patients with covid-19 in wuhan 2 3 4 hcovs mainly cause respiratory infections of which four endemic hcovs hcov-nl63 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 mainly cause mild respiratory infections and the other three epidemic hcovs sars-cov mers-cov sars-cov-2 can cause acute severe pneumonia 1933 coronaviruses originally discovered as hcov-229e are the cause of respiratory infections in children and adults but they are not particularly dangerous patients respiratory symptoms are mild similar to those of the common cold 34 most clinically significant coronavirus infections occur in children under two years of age although adults can also be severely infected 3536 mortality is negligible 37 however sars-cov and mers-cov which have appeared since 2003 are highly contagious and cause a high incidence and mortality rate of pneumonia 3337 38 39 in addition to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 is another human coronavirus that can cause severe pneumonia 1 the researchers compared the sequence of sars-cov-2 from wuhan with that of sars-cov and mers-cov through genetic testing and found that the gene sequence of sars-cov-2 is almost identical with a homology to mers of approximately 40 and a higher degree of homology to sars of approximately 70 40 the differences between the sequences are mainly in the orf1a gene and the spike gene encoding s-protein which is the key protein for the interaction between coronavirus and host cells 40 the coronavirus spike protein is a multifunctional molecular machine that mediates coronavirus entry into host cells it first binds to a receptor on the host cell surface through its s1 subunit and then fuses viral and host membranes through its s2 subunit 4142 some cellular receptors of human coronavirus have been identified including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 404344 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 45and aminopeptidase n apn 46 coronavirus enters the human body through receptors on the surface of host cells multiplies in the body and causes inflammation in the body and diseases such as pneumonia similar to sars-cov ace2 was found to be a receptor for sars-cov-2 434748 ace2 is also an important member of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas it catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin ii ang ii to angiotensin 1-7 activates downstream mas receptors and finally exerts anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects 49 in addition ace2 can also decompose ang ii into angiotensin 1-9 angiotensin 1-9 not only can be catalyzed by ace and further decompose into angiotensin 1-7 but also can directly activate ang  type 2 receptor at2r exerting its anti-inflammatory and anti-angiotensin  type 1 receptor at1r effects 50 ace2 is primarily expressed in the heart kidneys and testes and it is widely distributed in human alveolar epithelial cells small intestinal epithelial cells arterial smooth muscle and endothelial cells and vein endothelial cells 5152 in the heart ace2 is expressed in the endothelium 51 and cardiomyocytes 53 increasing evidence suggests that ace2 enzyme activity has a protective role in cardiovascular disease the loss of ace2 can be harmful because it may lead to worsened heart function and the progression of heart and vascular disease 4954 virus-induced ace2 down regulation may attenuate its function diminish its anti-inflammatory role and heightened angiotensin ii effects in the predisposed patients 55 the tissue localization of the receptors correlates with covid-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction in the lung ace2 is expressed in type i and type ii alveolar epithelial cells in addition 83 of type ii alveolar cells express ace2 56 the combination of sars-cov-2 with ace2 results in increased expression of ace2 which can lead to alveolar cell damage in turn triggering a series of whole-body reactions and even death 48 wrapp et al 18 found that the receptor-binding ability of sars-cov-2 is 10-20 times stronger than that of sars-cov providing a laboratory basis to prove that sars-cov-2 is more infectious than sars-cov 3 there is evidence showing that ace2 levels are higher in men than in women 48 however the male-to-female ratio of ncp-confirmed cases is 0991 in wuhan 1041 in hubei province and 1061 in china 8 meaning that there are few differences in prevalence between men and women however the crude case fatality rate for men 28 is slightly higher than that for women 17 8 however the relationship between ace2 expression level and sars-cov-2 infection rate and mortality remains unclear raas inhibitors including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor acei and angiotensin receptor blocker arb drugs are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension heart failure and myocardial inflammation they can control the level of ang ii in the body slow down the deterioration of inflammation and improve patient survival aceis and arbs can also exert their protective effects by activating the ace2angiotensin 1-7mas axis which may lead to increased ace2 in patients 5758 increased ace2 expression levels may lead to an increased risk of infection however there are no reports indicating that patients using aceisarbs are more likely to become infected whether acei  arb can be widely used in covid-19 patients with comorbid cardiovascular disease was unclear or even controversial 59 but recently guo et al reported that although more patients with higher troponin t tnt were using acei and arb medications owing to their baseline cvd their use was not associated with patients mortality rate 60 a research published in circulation research by zhang et al showed that among hospitalized covid-19 patients with hypertension inpatient use of acei  arb was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with acei  arb non-users 61 we can see that in-hospital use of acei  arb was not associated with an increased mortality risk there is no need for patients with hypertension to stop using acei  arb or switch to other antihypertensive medicine hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 35 were discovered in the 1960s and hcov-nl63 22 and hcov-hku1 26 were later discovered in upper respiratory tract infections asthma bronchiolitis and pneumonia there is evidence showing that infant elderly and immunocompromised patients are more likely to be infected with high mortality rates 3762 63 64 these infected patients are more likely develop severe disease states 65 66 67 68 varghese et al 37 retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 261 children with hcov infection including 229e hku1 nl63 oc43 and found that approximately 165 of the children had cardiovascular disease hcov-infected children with cardiovascular disease are more likely to receive respiratory support and enter a pediatric intensive care unit picu suggesting that the underlying cardiovascular disease increased the severity of hcov infection in the children cabea et al found that children with heart disease are more likely to be infected by hcovs 69 the presence of congenital heart disease was a significant risk factor for severe coronavirus infection in children who were less than five years old 70 table 1
 hypotension was found in a small number of patients with these four hcov infections 70 table 2
 there is no relevant evidence showing that hcov infection can cause heart injury however kim et al reported that hcovs were detected in children with kawasaki disease which is characterized by acute systemic vasculitis in childhood and may induce severe cardiovascular complications 71 serological tests suggest that hcov-229e may be involved in the occurrence of kawasaki disease 72 therefore we still need to pay attention to cardiovascular complications when facing these four kinds of hcov infection the severe acute respiratory syndrome 27 that broke out globally in 2003 is different from the human coronavirus described previously it is a severe acute respiratory infection with clinical manifestations of fever and dry cough with the lungs as the main locations of lesions some patients quickly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple organ failure with high mortality 73 74 75 76 77 there is much relevant evidence showing that pre-existing comorbid conditions are one of the major determinants of fatality 7678 79 80 81 82 83 it has been reported that the presence of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart disease is associated with adverse outcomes and mortality in sars patients 84 85 86 87 wong et al reviewed the medical records of fatal cases and found that 60 of the patients who died had comorbid conditions such as hypertension and coronary artery disease 88 chen et al found that patients with combined hypertension and cerebrovascular diseases are more likely to develop ards 89 another study by hu et al showed that the incidence rates of critical conditions and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome  mods  among sars patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were 18-fold and 19-fold higher than those of patients without underlying disease suggesting that cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are major risk factors for sars patients to devolve into critical conditions and mods and eventually lead to death 90 table 1 regarding the cardiovascular complications of sars patients it was found that sars patients had subclinical diastolic impairment without contraction involvement and this damage may be reversible upon clinical recovery 91 another study by yu et al found that cardiovascular complications including hypotension and tachycardia are common in sars patients but are usually self-limiting bradycardia and cardiac hypertrophy were less common and arrhythmias were rare 92 acute myocardial infarction can also be seen in a few sars patients 93 sars-cov was reported to be found in 40 718 patients of heart samples from patients who died of sars during the toronto outbreak 76 which might explain the myocardial damage discovered in sars patients 89 there are reports indicating that sars-cov also attacks small blood vessels throughout the body causing systemic vasculitis 94 table 2 in addition to clinical studies laboratory studies were performed to look for the pathophysiological mechanism associated with myocardial dysfunction caused by sars-cov infection 95 96 97 98 99 it was reported that pulmonary infection with sars-cov in mice led to a myocardial infection with a marked decrease in ace2 expression which may be responsible for the myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with sars 99 mers is a severe respiratory infectious disease caused by mers-cov that was first reported in saudi arabia in september 2012 29 the symptoms are similar to those of sars and severe cases can manifest as pneumonia with ards and other severe life-threatening complications such as septic shock acute myocarditis and multiple organ failure 100 101 102 103 104 105 the mortality rate of mers is 355 which is much higher than that of sars 10 39 it has been reported that people with underlying diseases such as diabetes cardiovascular disease renal failure obesity and immune deficiency are more likely to develop severe diseases after being infected with mers-cov 105106 badawi et al found that 50 of mers patients have diabetes and hypertension and that approximately 30 of patients have heart disease 107 they believed that these underlying disease conditions inhibit the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines damage the hosts natural and humoral immune systems and lead to an increased risk of severe mers complications another study found that 462 of the patients who died had hypertension suggesting that the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease increased the mortality of mers 108 banik suggested that sufficient attention should be paid to mers patients with combined underlying diseases to reduce the occurrence of serious complications and mortality 109 table 1 heart damage was also reported in mers patients 110 mers-cov was found in the kidneys of deceased patients but was not detected in the heart tissue and the heart showed no significant histological changes 111112 however an animal model study clearly stated that mers-cov rna could be seen in cardiac tissue implying direct cardiac pathology 113 the mechanism of heart injury in mers infection remains unclear and requires more research covid-19 which broke out at the end of 2019 is a disease caused by infection with sars-cov-2 124 similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 is a -cov 2 covid-19 is similar to sars and mers and manifests as extensively pathological viral lung inflammation 1 although similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 has its own characteristics 1114 early cases suggest that covid-19 may not be as severe as sars and mers however the rapidly increasing number of cases and increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission suggest that sars-cov-2 is more contagious than sars-cov and mers-cov and has a lower fatality 39115 116 117 up to april 27 2020 the overall mortality of covid-19 was 69 globally 5 but the fatality rate is different in different regions and times ranging from 07 to 135 5118 the symptoms of covid-19 infection appear after an incubation period of approximately 64 days 119 fever fatigue and dry cough are the main manifestations of covid-19 and a few patients have symptoms such as nasal congestion runny nose sore throat and diarrhea 29120121 patients with severe cases often experience dyspnea andor hypoxemia one week after onset 122 severe cases of covid-19 progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome septic shock and metabolic acidosis which is difficult to correct and coagulopathy 10 current case reports show that sars-cov-2 infection may have cardiovascular symptoms in addition to the typical respiratory symptoms a small number of patients have atypical clinical manifestations and may start with cardiovascular symptoms such as chest tightness palpitations and chest pain a study by liu et al found that 73 10137 of patients had palpitations as the first symptom 123 it was also reported that 2 of patients experienced chest pain during hospitalization 11 in addition wang et al found that 167 of patients with covid-19 had arrhythmias 10 according to relevant studies 9 10 11124 the proportion of covid-19 patients with comorbid cvds such as hypertension coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease was larger than that of patients with other comorbidities or without comorbidities suggesting that patients with cvd may be more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection moreover the incidence of cvd in patients with severe or fatal cases with covid-19 was higher than that in patients with nonsevere cases or in those who survived 1213124 according to the reports of the chinese center for disease control and prevention 157 of the deaths were hypertension and 9 had other cardiovascular diseases further suggesting that underlying cardiovascular diseases may be one of the important risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with covid-19 8 it can be seen not only that the number of covid-19 patients with cardiovascular disease is large but also that these patients have poor tolerance to severe pneumonia and are more likely to develop severe cases table 1 cardiac complications such as electrocardiography abnormities diastolic dysfunction and acute myocardial injury were reported in patients with covid-19 124 125 126 127 cases of severe myocarditis with reduced systolic function have been reported after covid-19 128 129 130 and sars-cov-2 infection-related myocarditis is likely associated with myocardial injury 60128 according to the study by li et al the most common organ damage outside the lungs was heart injury 13 serum myocardial necrosis markers such as hypersensitive troponin i hs-tni and creatine kinase ck increased to varying degrees in patients with mild and severe cases of covid-19 9 10 11 12 13 14131 132 133 134 however the risk of heart injury was higher in patients with severe cases approximately 222 to 31 912126133134 than in patients with mild cases approximately 2 to 4 910 the percentage of heart injury in covid-19 patients who died approximately 28 to 89 1213132 was higher than that in those who survived n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide nt-probnp levels were also reported to be increased 13134135 increased hs-tni and probnp expression levels may be risk factors for severe illness and high mortality of covid-19 133 134 135 furthermore it was found that high hs-tni levels were associated with increased levels of inflammation neutrophils il-6 crp and pct and decreased levels of immunity lymphocytes monocytes and cd4 and cd8  t cells suggesting that cardiac injury may have something to do with the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response 131132 table 2 two recent studies published in jama cardiology reported the cardiovascular complications of covid-19 in detail 60136 shi et al found that cardiac injury was a common condition among hospitalized patients with covid-19 in wuhan china and it is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality 136 guo et al reported that myocardial injury was significantly associated with fatal outcome of covid-19 myocardial injury was associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury 60 table 2 covid-19 may induce new cardiovascular diseases and  or aggravate potential cardiovascular diseases the short-term and long-term cardiovascular effects of covid-19 and the effects of specific treatments are unclear and need further investigation as the epidemic spread sars-cov-2 evolved multiple subtypes in a recent study researchers proposed the subdivision of the global sars-cov-2 population into sixteen well-defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural nsp3 nsp4 nsp6 nsp12 nsp13 and nsp14 cistrons structural spike and nucleocapsid and accessory orf8 genes 137 six virus subtypes were predominant in the population accounting for more than 97 of the samples isolated from around the world and the subtypes showed some geographical structure with two clusters a smaller one comprised of isolates mostly sampled from western hemisphere subtypes ii vi ix x and xi and a larger one whose isolates were sampled from western and eastern hemispheres subtypes i iii iv v vii viii xii xiii xiv xv and xvi 137 the researchers believed that the genetic structure determined for the sars-cov-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs 137 in another earlier study population genetic analyses of 103 sars-cov-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types designated l and s that are well defined by two different single nucleotide polymorphisms snps 138 the l type 70 is more prevalent than the s type 30 but the s type was found to be the ancestral version the l type is more aggressive and spread more quickly and it was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in wuhan but the frequency of the l type decreased after early january 2020 for more severe selective pressure placed by human intervention on the l type 138 contrary to the l type the s-type which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive might have increased in relative frequency due to the weaker selective pressure 138 it was also reported that among the 27 viruses isolated from wuhan 26 963 were l type and only 1 37 was s type 138 however among the other 73 viruses isolated outside wuhan 45 616 were l type and 28 384 were s type 138 this comparison suggests that the l type was significantly more prevalent in wuhan than in other places and recent studies about the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with covid-19 in wuhan 9 10 11139 or outside wuhan 134140141have showed that the mortality of covid-19 patients and the proportion of patients with cardiac injury outside wuhan was lower than that in wuhan table 3
 although there were many reasons for the different incidence of cardiac injury and outcome of covid-19 in and outside wuhan such as the shortage of medical resources in wuhan the role of different sars-cov-2 subtypes cannot be ignored the relationship between sars-cov-2 subtypes and the mortality of covid-19 or the cvd complications need for further immediate comprehensive studies that combine genomic data epidemiological data and records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 according to the references above we can see that patients with underlying cvd may be more likely to become infected with coronavirus and cvd may be one of the risk factors for poor prognosis and high mortality of cov infection few studies however have explored the mechanisms underlying these associations we believe that the possible mechanisms may be related to inflammation cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are all metabolic-related diseases it has been reported that metabolic syndrome can downregulate the key mediator of the hosts innate immune response to pathogenesis affecting the function of the innate and humoral immune systems 142 chronic low-grade inflammatory disease has been widely recognized as a feature of coronary heart disease and its occurrence is closely related to inflammation 143 the occurrence of hypertension is associated with oxidative stress inflammation and the activation of the immune system 144 il-6 il-1 and tumor necrosis factor  tnf- levels are higher in patients with hypertension than in patients with normal blood pressure 145 this may explain why patients with underlying cardiovascular disease found in the clinic are more susceptible to infection kulcsar et al showed that mers-cov infection can lead to prolonged respiratory tract inflammation immune cell dysfunction and changes in the expression profile of inflammatory mediators 146 lymphopenia and increased inflammatory mediators were found in sars-cov-2 infection 147 immune disorders caused by sars-cov infection have also been reported 148 these may lead to the exacerbation of the original cardiovascular disease which is related to the death of some patients found in the clinic due to heart failure 88103132 according to information released by the shanghai municipal health and family planning commission the first covid-19 death in shanghai was in an individual who was 88 years old with a severe history of hypertension and cardiac insufficiency an analysis of the cause of death suggested that the patient died of heart failure and systemic multiple organ dysfunction therefore sars-cov-2 infection was just an inducement for exacerbations 124 overall the heart and lungs are inseparable in the normal physiological functions of the human body on the one hand comorbidities and complications of the heart increase the risk of pneumonia infection and exacerbation on the other hand pneumonia infection may aggravate existing cardiovascular diseases such as increased blood pressure increased heart failure and the recurrence of myocardial infarction fever is a common symptom in patients with coronavirus infection 927149 fever promotes the immune functions of humans and some animals and decreases the pathogenicity of some microbes antibody production t-cell activation neutrophil function and macrophage oxidative metabolism have been reported to increase in the presence of fever 150 151 152 153 154 however to avoid excessively elevated body temperature affecting normal physiological functions the body will activate sympathetic nerves and regulate circulatory function which will increase the heart rate and cardiac output 155 an increase in heart rate over a long period of time will lead to increased myocardial oxygen consumption and decreased cardiac output which may cause ischemia or heart failure 156 many diseases with fever symptoms may be complicated by myocarditis such as spotted fever rickettsioses infection 157 severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome 158 drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms 159 dengue 160 161 162 complicated scrub typhus 163 herpes simplex virus infection 164 enteric fever 165 a decrease in cardiac function may occur in febrile illnesses but whether myocardial damage is due to fever or the underlying infection is not known 166 weissinger et al found that in pigs with a bacterial infection with elevated body temperature serum ck lactate dehydrogenase ld and gamma-globulin gg levels were increased the administration of antibiotics to these pigs and lowering their body temperature reduced ck and ld levels but gg levels remained elevated suggesting that the infection did not decrease this study indicated that the levels of ck and ld were elevated due to fever caused by infection 167 k l et al discovered that a longer duration of fever was related to the occurrence of pericarditis after myocardial infarction 168 therefore heart injury in coronavirus infection may be related to fever severe pneumonia can cause significant gas exchange disturbances and lead to hypoxemia hypoxia reduces the energy production required for cell metabolism and increases the bodys anaerobic digestion acidosis and oxygen free radicals accumulated in the cell destroy the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane as hypoxia continues the intracellular calcium ion concentration increases significantly leading to a series of cell damage processes including apoptosis 169 at the same time hypoxia can also induce inflammatory reactions such as the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the release of cytokines leading to further tissue ischemia and may even cause myocardial infarction 13170171 previous lessons from coronavirus and influenza have shown that viral infections can cause acute coronary syndrome 172173 arrhythmia 174 and exacerbation of heart failure 175 mainly due to a combination of significant systemic inflammation response and localized vascular inflammation at the arterial plaque along with other effects 176 177 178 evidence has shown that sars-cov induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 mcp-1 transforming growth factor-beta 1 tgf-beta1 tnf il-1 and il-6 and interferon- ifn- in sars patients and experimental animal models infected with sars-cov 179180 tnf and il-1 family and il-6 family cytokines are considered proinflammatory mediators of heart failure and they have obvious negative inotropic effects which may explain heart failure complications in sars infection 181 the acute heart injury might be due to the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response to sars infection 30 there is evidence indicating that myocardial inflammation induced by sars-cov is mainly mediated by macrophages and the resultant production of chemokines 9596 the nuclear factor-b nf-b signaling pathway associated with the induction of proinflammatory cytokines is activated in sars-cov-infected mice treatment with drugs that inhibited nf-b activation led to a reduction in inflammation in both sars-cov-infected cultured cells and mice and significantly increased mouse survival after sars-cov infection indicating that the activation of the nf-b signaling pathway represents a major contribution to the inflammation induced after sars-cov infection and that nf-b inhibitors are promising antivirals in infections caused by sars-cov and potentially other pathogenic human coronaviruses 182 sars-cov-2 appears to affect themyocardium and cause myocarditis 128 myocardial injury is likely associated with infection-related myocarditis andor ischemia 60 increases in inflammatory factors such as crp il-1 and il-6 were also discovered in sars-cov-2 infection 131132147 wu et al believed that sars-cov-2 may cause heart damage by the cytokine storm 131 evidence has shown that sars-cov-2 may mainly affect t lymphocytes especially cd4  t cells resulting in a significant decrease in lymphocyte numbers 183 the extent of lymphopenia and an increase in inflammatory cytokines are related to the severity of the disease 147 critically ill covid-19 patients had higher levels of il6 il10 tnf lactate dehydrogenase ldh and c-reactive protein than patients with mild covid-19 9139184 suggesting that inflammatory indicators are an important factor in the early diagnosis of severe covid-19 most patients with coronavirus infection are in an inflammatory state which places the patients in a hypercoagulable state for example covid-19 leads to an increase in d-dimer levels in 40 of patients a decrease in activated partial thromboplastin time aptt in 16 of patients and a decrease in pt in 30 of patients further increasing the risk of embolism 11 hypercoagulability induced by inflammation might contribute to plaque rupture with subsequent thrombosis and myocardial injury 185 therefore clinicians should pay attention to covid-19 patients with coronary heart disease to prevent myocardial injury and myocardial infarction septic shock can be seen as a serious complication in sars mers and covid-19 1376103 approximately 62 of sars-cov-2 infections are complicated by shock 126 it was reported that left ventricular dysfunction occurs in approximately 20 of patients within 6 hours after the onset of septic shock and the incidence can increase to 60 by 1 to 3 days after the onset of septic shock 186 myocardial dysfunction and cardiovascular inflammation might lead to elevated creatine kinase and troponin 187 which might explain the high hs-tni in deceased patients in addition to the abovementioned accompanying symptoms anxiety and stress can also lead to adverse reactions such as accelerated heart rhythms and elevated blood pressure especially in critically ill patients 188189 health anxiety could be found in coronavirus-infected patients 190 generally everyone experiences health anxiety to some degree and the associated vigilance to a potential health-related threat can be protective however excessive health anxiety can be detrimental 190 the literature indicates that stress can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system leading to an increase in peripheral glucocorticoid and catecholamine levels 191 high plasma catecholamine levels are associated with an increased risk of heart failure altered autonomic activity during depression can lead to arrhythmias the activated sns alters cardiac wall contractility and increases apoptotic pathways in cardiomyocytes contributing to cvd development although there is no relevant study on covid-19 patients suffering from anxiety medical workers have been reported to be anxious after direct contact with the patients 192193 a study by sun et al showed that some chinese showed acute posttraumatic stress symptoms during the covid-19 outbreak 194 therefore psychological counseling should be conducted on patients in a timely manner and anxiolytic drugs could be used when necessary as mentioned above sars-cov was reported to lead to myocardial infection with a marked decrease in ace2 expression which may be responsible for myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with sars 99 direct sars-cov infection of cardiomyocytes may also lead to myocarditis and impaired myocardial function coronavirus-induced myocarditis and its subsequent progression to dilated cardiomyopathy have been described in rabbit models 195 sars-cov was found in heart samples from patients who died of sars 76 pathological findings showed a marked increase in macrophage infiltration in patients with sars-cov in the heart with evidence of myocardial damage mers-cov was not detected in the heart tissue and the heart showed no significant histological changes in mers patients 111112 however an animal model study clearly stated that mers-cov rna could be seen in cardiac tissue implying direct cardiac pathology 113 although myocarditis was reported in sporadic autopsy cases 128 there is still no clear pathological evidence supporting that sars-cov-2 can directly cause heart damage the most frequently used drugs during hospitalization are glucocorticoids and antiviral drugs as well as antibiotics the secondary qt interval prolongation caused by the use of drugs during hospitalization cannot be ignored antiviral drugs lopinavir ritonavir antibiotics azithromycin moxifloxacin levofloxacin antifungal drugs glucocorticoids and some antiarrhythmic drugs there is a potential risk of prolonging the qtc interval 196197 drug-associated qt prolongation is associated with increased arrhythmic and non-arrhythmic mortality and it therefore continues to be an important metric of drug safety 198 a small study in france enrolling 26 treated patients and 16 non-randomized controls showed that hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin shortened the time to resolution of viral shedding of covid-19 199 based on this study clinicians in many countries have begun using these medications in clinical practice and multiple randomized trials are being initiated but there were occasional case reports of hydroxychloroquine prolonging the qt interval and provoking torsade de pointes when used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus 200 201 202 203 the widely used antibiotic azithromycin was gradually recognized as a rare cause of prolonged qt severe arrhythmia and increased risk of sudden death 204 205 206 207 although there were no reports of arrhythmia death caused by the use of hydroxychloroquine the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin should also be noted 208 active support with expected management based on early prognostic indicators may improve recovery appropriate treatment of heart failure arrhythmia acute coronary syndrome and thrombosis are still important with continued global cooperation on multiple methods specific evidence-based treatment strategies for covid-19 will emerge in order to protect the wider population antibody testing and effective vaccines will be needed to make a history of covid-19 and some treatment related issues need attention firstly the use of acei  arb drugs was controversial in the earlier phase of covid-19 epidemic but recently published studies suggested that there is no need for patients with hypertension to stop using acei  arb or switch to other antihypertensive medicine 6061209 some conjectures 210 based on the disease mechanism in the early stage of the outbreak that acei  arb may increase the infection of new coronavirus and the aggravation of covid-19 by increasing the expression of ace2 have been denied by more and more clinical evidence we see that the continuous treatment of covid-19 patients with hypertension with acei  arb will not only cause the deterioration of the condition but also continue to exert cardiovascular protection and even improve the prognosis 6061209 secondly we should pay attention to the application of hydroxychloroquine 200 201 202 203 and azithromycin 204 205 206 207 for their side effects of prolonging the qt interval other drugs used to treat the covid-19 patients such as antiviral drugs lopinavir ritonavir antibiotics moxifloxacin levofloxacin antifungal drugs glucocorticoids and some antiarrhythmic drugs can cause the qt interval prolongation and should attract more attention reference by sapp et al would help to minimize risk of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmia during treatment of covid-19 211 thirdly a recent study from jama reported that the mortality rate of patients with mechanical ventilation treatment was 881 212 multiple studies around the world have shown that the mortality rate of covid-19 patients using ventilator was still high 213 214 215 and it was believed that the ventilator should be used more cautiously in patients with covid-19 which can reduce the mortality of patients using the ventilator by more than 50 216 new guidelines should be established for when to use a ventilator for patients with covid-19 we advocate the application of staged breathing support methods to delay the use of ventilator simple oxygen treatment like nasal oxygen supply may be safer and more effective fourth methylprednisolone are the classical immunosuppressive drugs which are important to stop or delay the progress of the pneumonia and have been proved to be effective for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in recent study 217 wu at al found that the administration of methylprednisolone appeared to reduce the risk of death in covid-19 patients with ards however of those who received methylprednisolone treatment 23 of 50 patients died this is a rather high mortality of 50 the indication timing dosage and duration the application of methylprednisolone needs further investigation fifth the early report showed that remdesivir was highly effective in the control of sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 218 but recent study published in lancet showed that remdesivir did not reduce the mortality of covid-19 patients 219 however another clinical trial showed that remdesivir accelerates recovery from advanced covid-19 220 another clinical trial showed that there was no significant difference in clinical outcome between the 5-day and 10-day course of remdesivir 221 these data suggested remdesivir does not reduce the mortality of covid-19 patients but have an effect on shortening the course of disease in mild patients and early medication may be better the application of remdesivir needs further researches clinical data indicate that comorbid cardiovascular disease will aggravate the severity of coronavirus infection leading to a poor prognosis coronavirus may cause myocardial injury and the prognosis of patients with complicated myocardial injury is poor the mechanism of coronavirus causing myocardial injury and drug treatment options remain to be further studied this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public

coronavirus infection we aimed to analyze the effects of rasi in covid-19 patients with hypertension clinical features laboratory parameters medications and the length of stay all the patients were given antiviral and antihypertension treatment of which 14 patients were treated with rasi and 13 patients without rasi results comparing the two groups we did not found statistically significant differences in clinical symptoms and laboratory tests furthermore cough was not aggravated through the analysis of this small sample rasi could be deemed safe and effective to control high blood pressure of covid-19 patients further analysis with a larger sampling size is required to explore the underlying mechanisms from the small sample data patients with covid-19 and hypertension who continued taking the original antihypertensive drugs had good blood pressure control and no obvious adverse reactions acei or arb drugs had no obvious effects on patients symptoms laboratory tests and prognosis concurrently we did not found that acei or arb caused additional page 7 of 10 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f -7 -side-effects in patients with covid-19 infection or promoted new coronary

similar to the common cold to fatal diseases in people across the world as of 200am cest 3  there is evidence that covid-19 can be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets and close contact which poses a huge challenge to public health 1  according to the latest research on single-cell rna-seq researchers believe that the sars-cov-2 rna expression and replication are related to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 2  importantly ace2 was confirmed as the sars-cov-2 cell entry receptor which is the same as sars-cov3 renin angiotensin system inhibitor rasi is a commonly used antihypertensive drug however its not clear whether rasi can increase the expression of ace2 leading to the higher risk of sars-cov-2 infection should patients with hypertension stop using rasi we explored the question about the effects of administering rasi to patients with covid-19 and hypertension by analyzing the data from the shanghai public health clinical center from january 25 2020 to january 31 2020 we received a total of 27 patients with hypertension combined with covid-19 at the shanghai public health clinical center all cases were confirmed covid-19 cases with hypertension history more than 3 months the clinical criteria for diagnosis and discharge refer to the diagnosis and treatment of new 4 and was exempted from the need for informed consent from patients the research team collected and analyzed 27 patients medical records epidemiological clinical and laboratory characteristics information of treatment and outcome of the patients were obtained from the inpatient management system blood pressure and medication were recorded during hospitalization all patients rested in bed and were monitored for vital signs and finger oxygen saturation and given effective oxygen therapy in time the basic principles of treatment are nutritional support and symptomatic treatment to maintain water and electrolyte balance and a stable internal environment antiviral therapy was tried with interferon lopinavirlitonavir dnrunavir and abidol antibiotics were used if necessary other therapy include -globulin thymosin alphavitamin c and traditional chinese

variables shown as percentages were compared using fishers exact test statistical analysis software spss220 was used for all analyses in this study as of january 31 2020 27 cases of covid-19 with hypertension were admitted to the shanghai public health clinical center of which 13 481 were female and 14 519 were male the age of the patients was 613  135 years with a range from 37 years to 80 years the patients clinical manifestations were fever 704 cough 333 and phlegm 296 the specific drugs for antihypertension treatment are shown in table 1  all patients received 1 to 3 oral antihypertensive drugs including diuretics calcium antagonists blockers acei and arb most patients 852 did not need to adjust antihypertensive drugs the arterial pressure in the rasi group was 1017  95mmhg which was not statistically different p  0641 with that of the non-rasi group 1011  99mmhg there are 14 519 cases in the rasi group including 8 males and 13 481 cases in the non-rasi group including 6 males  table 2  there was no statistically significant difference in age and sex ratio between the two groups no difference was found in clinical and symptoms fever cough phlegm as well as in time from onset to admission length of stay and laboratory tests between the two groups the classic ras regulation pathway is that renin acts on angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin ang i and ang i produces ang ii which is under the action of ace on the other hand the non-classical ras regulatory pathway is also known as the negative ace2angiotensin 1-7 ang 1-7 axis which refers to the generation of ang 1-7 by ang ii under the action of ace2 renin-angiotensin system inhibitors rasi such as acei or arb drugs may indirectly improve ace2 activity through restraining ace level its worth noting that sars-cov-2 invades the human body in the same way as sars-cov 2  that is the spike protein on the surface of the virus and the receptor ace2 on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells combine with each other then enter the cell causing a series of pathological changes one of the very important changes is that the human ace2 expression is significantly down-regulated and the classic ras regulatory pathway is activated 5  the imbalance in the positive and negative axis of ras relative or absolute increase in ang ii levels overstimulation of at1 and the result is increased pulmonary capillary permeability and subsequent lung emergence edema severe lung injury and acute lung failure 6  however it is controversial whether as one of the classical antihypertensive drugs rasi may increase the risk of coronavirus infection or be beneficial for coronavirus infection control cough is the main adverse effect of acei and the mechanism is the increased bradykinin cough is also the most common symptom of coronavirus respiratory infections patients taking acei for a long period of time usually do not need to stop acei during respiratory infections because coronavirus infection down-regulates ace2 level and does not affect ace 7 ace2 levels do not change bradykinin levels 8  even if the rasi could change the level or activity of ace2 in the target tissue clinical data are insufficient to indicate whether this in turn promotes the binding and entry of sars-cov-2 spikes 7 our data shows that there is no increase in severity of coughing in patients treated with rasi theoretically ace2 level is down-regulated after coronavirus binds ace2 leading to the imbalance of positive and negative regulation of ras and abnormal increase in ang ii level and activity 9  rasi may be a suitable antihypertensive agent in these cases using acei or arb drugs has no effects on patients symptoms laboratory tests and prognosis both acei and arb have exact antihypertensive effects as well as clinical effects such as protecting the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular improving renal function reducing left ventricular hypertrophy preventing heart failure and preventing atrial fibrillation existing studies suggest that aceis such as captopril or lisinopril do not affect the activity of ace2 10 and there is no evidence that acei or arb may bring special effects to patients with covid-19 infection or new coronary pneumonia damage so we recommend that the overall control of patients with new coronary pneumonia is persistent and most of them do not need to adjust

yancheng xu   the ongoing outbreak of the corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy 1 2 3 on 30 january 2020 the world health organization who declared it to be a public health emergency of international concern as of 10 march 2020 more than 105 countries 114253 cases of covid-19 and 4000 deaths have been reported all over the world of which the number of confirmed patients in china has gradually decreased but is increasing rapidly in other countries especially in italy south korea and iran and there are lots of doctors engaged in combating it 45 the sars-cov-2 was first reported in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from three patients in wuhan jinyintan hospital and was confirmed as the cause of covid-19 on january 24 2020 6 after deep examining the full-length genome we found that the virus belongs to the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage in the phylogenetic tree 7 and is a new human-infecting beta-coronavirus which had previously not been detected in humans or animals it is named covid-19 by the who and sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses as it is similar to the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov 8 it shares more than 8799  identity sequencing with the bat sars-like coronavirus and it shares more than 80  identity nucleotide with the original sars epidemic virus 9 10 11 coronavirus spike s glycoproteins promote entry into cells they are the main target of antibodies and bind with high affinity to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor in humans in a manner similar to sars-cov 12 13 14 however the sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the s1s2 subunits which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from sars-cov and sars-related covs 1516 at present research reports that the incubation period in most people range from 1 to 14 days with a median of 56 days but the incubation period may even be as long as 24 days 17 the reproductive number r0 for sars-cov-2 although still preliminary is estimated between 2 and 3 suggesting a higher pandemic potential than sars 18 fever or cough may be the major symptom but asymptomatic individuals have also been identified as potential sources of infection 19 at present we think that the new coronavirus is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact but transmission from an asymptomatic carrier appears to be possible 20 a report of 9 pregnant patients suggests that perinatal transmission is unlikely but larger studies are needed to confirm this finding 21 although viral rna is found in stool whether it can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route still needs to be confirmed by subsequent investigations 2223 recently some patients were found to be re-positive after being treated with negative nucleic acid tests twice and symptoms disappeared it is difficult for us to decrease the severity of covid-19 owing to the complex structure and unclear physiological mechanism with the increasing number of confirmed cases the clinical investigation of patients and antiviral treatment solution has been insufficient and there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease in order to prove more accurate conclusions on the prevalence of comorbidity and relation of clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with covid-19 we searched the relevant literatures and carried out single arm meta-analysis to describe epidemiological clinical characteristics complications and outcomes of patients confirmed to have 2019-ncov infection and to compare the severity between diabetes or hypertension and non-diabetes or non-hypertension patients our findings provide vital guidance for current clinical work on the prevention and treatment of 2019-ncov infection a computerized search spanning january1 1980 to march 10 2020 was conducted in medline sino med embase and cochrane library databases the following search terms were used in all possible combinations corona virus disease-2019 mesh or 2019 novel coronavirus mesh or sars-cov-2 mesh or covid-19 mesh or 2019-ncov mesh the search was limited to human subjects there was no language limitation the titles and abstracts of potentially relevant studies identified by the computerized search were reviewed full-text articles were obtained for detailed evaluation and eligible studies were included in the systematic review the inclusion criteria were the following randomized controlled trial clinical trials and series cases patients who were of either sex and had been diagnosed with covid-19 all patients with laboratory-identified sars-cov-2 infection who had had both real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction detection of sars-cov-2 nucleic acid positive in throat swabs or lower respiratory tract and ct scanning of the lung inclusion of the epidemiological clinical characteristics laboratory and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcome clear description of the clinical characteristics such as comorbidities including hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease and malignancy and the signs and symptoms such as fever cough fatigue and dyspnea clear description of the outcomes including the major complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards acute cardiac injuryaci acute kidney injuryaki shock and incidence of severity and mortality the exclusion criteria were the following absence of clinical characteristics treatment outcome clinical experience and case reports two authors independently extracted data by reviewing all titles and abstracts of the searched papers if any disagreement on the choice of the literature exists a third evaluator will join in to make the decision the following information was recorded from the included trials first author year of publication number of participants and residence of patients basic data about gender age and diagnosis were extracted and analyzed to evaluate the proportion of comorbidity such as diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disease and malignancy the proportion of symptoms such as fever cough fatigue and dyspnea the proportion of clinical complications including ards aci aki and shock and the severity and mortality two readers independently extracted and reviewed the data from the enrolled studies to ensure consistency the quality of the included studies was assessed by the newcastleottawa scale in order to objectively evaluate the publication bias of the included studies the egger test with p  005 as the existence of publication bias was performed and those with larger values were considered as having no publication bias the single arm meta-analysis of proportions and 95 ci was calculated for the clinical symptoms complication outcome and for each of the selected comorbidities using stata 150 the presence of heterogeneity among the identified studies cochrans q and the extent of heterogeneity i 2 index were examined as described previously all original data included in the literature were first transformed by double arcsine method to make them conform to normal distribution and then analyzed in stata the initial conclusion obtained by meta-analysis was then restored using formula psintp2 2 to reach final conclusion we performed sensitivity analysis to assess the stability of the results and investigate the influence of each study by omitting a single study sequentially using the egger test we found no evidence of bias in any of the lag periods the initial 1057 citations were identified based on a study of the subject and a summary of the literature of which 694 articles were thereafter excluded because of duplication after reviewing the title and abstract of the remaining 81 studies only 34 full-text studies were evaluated for further assessment and 13 obviously irrelevant records were excluded eventually 21 clinical studies 61724 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 were consistent with the inclusion requirements a detailed study flow-diagram is shown in fig 1
 the basic characteristics and quality of the included studies were illustrated in table 1
 twenty-one studies were selected with a total of 47344 patients 24419 male and 22925 females representing approximately 40  of the who confirmed one clinical trial investigated the characteristics of patients in singapore and all others came from china mainly in wuhan systematic analysis of the studies describing the epidemiological demographic and clinical features of covid-19 cases and reporting of the prevalence of a number of chronic diseases in the infectious disease was undertaken the number of cases in the selected studies varied by approximately 3722-fold and ranged from 12 to 44672 cases the sex ratio male to female was 106 and the overall average age of the subjects was greater than 40 years forty-one cases reported in jinyintan hospital are the earliest confirmed cases patients treated in wenzhou hospital almost are mild but xiaobo yang et al reported 52 cases with covid-19 that were all critical patients all studies detailed the pre-treatment biochemical characteristics and subsequent treatment eighteen studies reported the comorbidity of diabetes only 7 of them introduced the proportion of severity 14 studies reported hypertension and 6 of them introduced the proportion of severity 13 studies reported malignant and 12 studies reported cad with regard to symptoms 20 studies recorded fever and cough 12 studies reported fatigue and 15 studies reported dyspnea seven studies recorded the complication of ards and aci and shock was recorded in 4 and 5 studies respectively fifteen studies showed critical patients and 12 research reported mortality all studies provided incidence data of at least one kind of comorbidity symptom or complication sixteen forest plots were used to illustrate the prevalence of comorbidities in covid-19 from the selected studies and to inspect the heterogeneity of the individual findings meta-analysis of the identified studies showed that the most prevalent clinical symptoms were fever 856  95ci 813899  and cough 657  95ci 601714  followed by fatigue 424  95ci 322526  and shortness of breath 214  95ci 153275  fig 2
 there was significant heterogeneity cochrans q in the estimates of clinical symptoms among the examined studies p  0001 with an i2 index varying from 874  to 951  the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension comorbidities was 77  95ci 6193  and 156  95ci 126186  respectively the incidence of cardiovascular disease and malignancy was 47  95ci 3162  and 12  95ci 0518  respectively fig 3
 the case complications including ards risk ranged from 56 to 132  with the pooled estimate at 94  acute cardiac injury 58  95ci 07108  acute kidney injury 21  95ci 0637  and shock 47  95ci 0986  were also present fig 4
 the risks of severity and mortality rate ranged from 126 to 235  and from 20 to 44  with pooled estimates at 180 and 32  respectively the percentage of severe cases in diabetes and hypertension cases was 445  95ci 270619  and 417  95ci 264569  respectively fig 5
 sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the stability of pooled results among the 21 studies the significant results were not obviously altered after sequentially omitting each study in the pooled results comparing the incidence of mortality after excluding the report by chaolin huang et al the heterogeneity decreased significantly or  0719 95  ci  02771865 p  0497 i  28  and showed that there was no significant difference in preventing the ards rate between the two groups hence it was regarded as a result of heterogeneity likewise the other studies were considered as the source of heterogeneity because the heterogeneity significantly changed and showed that there was no significant difference in preventing ards between the two groups when each of these studies were excluded from the pooled results comparing the incidence of ards a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether the exclusion of this study would alter the result and exclusion of this study from the meta-analysis did not substantially influence the results in this part of the study ards was used to assess publication bias egger test results showed pr  jzj  100 therefore we believe that the risk of publication bias is low in this meta-analysis the outbreak of covid-19 has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by who by march 10 2020 the epidemic had spread to 25 countries around the world in accordance with the experience of china surgical masks are in widespread use which is beneficial to prevent the acquisition of covid-19 in addition italy started taking measures to block traffic and lockdown villages with the rising incidence of covid-19 all over the world feasible and effective messaging about the clinical characteristics of covid-19 is greatly needed therefore the focus of this analysis was to evaluate the prevalence of symptoms comorbidity complications and different outcomes in china and singapore the meta-analysis identified 21 published studies that assessed this proportion there are few published rcts because of the rapid development of the epidemic and there are limited medical resources in addition to the presence of uncontrollable risk during treatment much of the evidence of effects cannot be adequately studied in randomized trials such as long-term and rare outcomes therefore we analyzed all retrospective studies in this study for the main results we found that the cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults and there is no difference in susceptibility between male and female fever is the most common symptom in patients with 2019-ncov infection the most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension and diabetes which are associated with the rapid development of severe illness ards and aci may be the main obstacles for patients to treatment recovery the severity and mortality of patients with 2019-ncov infection is lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers but the prevalence of covid-19 is much higher than sars and the mers two coronaviruses have previously caused significant outbreaks associated with more critical disease the sars coronavirus in 20022003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus that emerged in 2012 43 44 45 a lot of studies have reported the clinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 but there is a lack of studies on the relation of severity and mortality with comorbidity similarly there is no meta-analysis published on complications for patients covid-19 infected therefore this is a novel systematic review and meta-analysis due to the inadequate evidence we present this meta-analysis by consolidating multiple studies to enable enhanced clinical decision making in the future we report here a cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-ncov infection patients had serious sometimes fatal complications and were admitted to the designated hospital clinical presentations greatly resemble sars-cov patients with severe illness developed ards aki aci or shock and required icu admission and oxygen therapy however despite a comprehensive analysis there are also many limitations that should be taken into consideration in our meta-analysis first the studies included in the meta-analysis were not all rcts second in the literature-included studies the treatment of every hospital is not completely similar third owing to the treatment by grading of mild ordinary and critical the severity of patients in different hospitals varies greatly in addition as the cause and physio pathological mechanism was unknown at the onset of emerging infections the treatment in wuhan was only based on clinical experience leading to a higher complication and mortality fourth partial missing information in a few articles may lead to biased results we have attempted to contact investigators or study sponsors to verify key study characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data moreover clinical and methodological heterogeneities were observed in several parameters in the meta-analysis given the variation in intervention techniques patient composition and preferences among different cities true heterogeneity and poor methodological quality could also lead to an asymmetric plot in the future larger higher quality clinical trials should be conducted and we will conduct a more detailed subgroup analysis to explore the sources of heterogeneity to obtain a more reliable conclusion and more effort should be made to answer these questions in future studies covid-19 is an emerging infectious disease of global public health concern our results note the similarity of clinical symptoms and complications between covid-19 and previous beta-coronavirus infections the incidence of severity and mortality of covid-19 is much higher than that of ordinary influenza and the prevalence of chronic diseases including diabetes and hypertension is rising as populations age and lifestyle and dietary habits change in addition we found that diabetes and hypertension are closely related to severity and mortality improving the protection against covid-19 in persons with chronic disorders is essential last but not least there is a need to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health-care workers thus preventing transmission amplification events and preventing further international spread the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

multivariable analysis with one showing non-significant association for cvd and the other demonstrating adjusted rr 2 for hypertension and diabetes no study explored renin-angiotensin system inhibitors as a risk factor for severe covid-19 conclusions in addition to older age and male sex hypertension diabetes and cvd were associated in univariate analyses with severe covid-19 although

factors to positions with reduced risk of exposure to  to date several studies have reported that a history of cardiovascular disease cvd and traditional cvd risk factors eg age male sex current smoking hypertension and diabetes are associated with severe covid-19 however other than age results have been inconsistent furthermore few studies accounted for potential confounding by age and sex when they evaluated other potential risk factors for example some studies reported that hypertension is a risk factor of severe covid-19 but their observations may simply reflect the fact that hypertension is more common in older adults 3 nonetheless despite the lack of robust evidence this observation together with the fact sars-cov-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as an entry to human body 4 has raised a concern about continued use of reninangiotensin system increase among some clinicians and researchers 5 6 in this context we conducted a systematic review of studies

35 an important question is whether these associations are independent of major confounders particularly age although we could not obtain a definite answer as very few studies ran multivariable models our meta-regression analysis indicated some degree of confounding by age one study by zhou et al showed substantial attenuation of the association between coronary heart disease and severe covid-19 on the other hand liang et al showed independent associations of hypertension and diabetes with severe covid-19 in a relatively large sample size of 1590 patients these is also biologic plausibility hypertension and diabetes are leading risk factors for cvd and kidney diseases and there is evidence that covid-19 damages these organs 34 35 available studies provide scant evidence related to the hypothesized adverse effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on severity of covid-19 infection as noted above there is biological plausibility for potential associations of covid-19 with hypertension and diabetes two comorbidities associated with use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors only one study reported the prevalence of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors use 13 in this study 30 of patients reported prevalent hypertension but only 5 of patients were taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors 13 thus it is reasonable that many expert organizations recommend continuing this category of medications until better evidence becomes available 4 our results can potentially be used to guide decision-making while the lack of discrete age thresholds for severe covid-19 complicates this process data on case fatality rates from three countries web table 2  suggest that age older than 60 or 65 years confers high risk of severe covid-19 relative risk  5 compared to 50 years our results also indicate male sex is an independent risk factor with a pooled relative risk of 17 although it is very likely that the pooled crude relative risk of 3-35 for hypertension diabetes and cvd overestimate their impact beyond age and sex all or some of them may each confer 15-2 times greater risk thus using these factors it is possible to estimate at least crudely the risk of severe covid-19 for example a man aged 60-65 years old with either hypertension diabetes or prior cvd would  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder

testing for covid-19 clinical management of covid-19 and workforce planning our study has some limitations first reflecting the fact that the outbreak started from china most studies were from china however given similar case-fatality rates and clinical manifestations across different countries it seems likely that these results are largely generalizable nonetheless we need to acknowledge regional variations of some risk factors eg 25-fold difference in the prevalence of smoking in men vs women in china 36  and thus future investigations in different regions would be valuable second we did not include non-english publications third most studies reported odds ratios which are known to overestimate risk ratio when the prevalence of exposures is relatively high fourth we cannot deny the possibility that some patients were included in multiple studies especially in the china cdc report 14 and other chinese studies nonetheless the pooled estimates were largely similar in analyses that excluded the china cdc data data not shown finally the literature of covid-19 is growing rapidly and thus there is a lag time from our literature search and publication on the other hand our systematic review has several strengths in-depth review of cvd and its risk factors a clinically relevant definitions of severe covid-19 that minimize subjective reporting meta-regression to explore potential confounding and relatively short elapsed time of 2 weeks between the literature search and manuscript submission in conclusion our systematic review and meta-analysis found robust

covid-19 hong yu li li hsin-hui huang yang wang yingtong liu edison ong anthony huffman tao zeng jingsong zhang pengpai li zhiping liu xiangyan zhang xianwei ye samuel handelman k gerry higgins gilbert omenn s brian athey junguk hur luonan chen yongqun he  given the existing covid-19 pandemic worldwide it is critical to systematically study the interactions between hosts and coronaviruses including sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 cause of  we first created four host-pathogen interaction hpi-outcome postulates and generated a hpi-outcome model as the basis for understanding host-coronavirus interactions hci and their relations with the disease outcomes we hypothesized that ontology can be used as an integrative platform to classify and analyze hci and disease outcomes accordingly we annotated and categorized different coronaviruses hosts and phenotypes using ontologies and identified their relations various covid-19 phenotypes are hypothesized to be caused by the backend hci mechanisms to further identify the causal hci-outcome relations we collected 35 experimentally-verified hci protein-protein interactions ppis and applied literature mining to identify additional host ppis in response to coronavirus infections the results were formulated in a logical ontology representation for integrative hci-outcome understanding using known ppis as baits we also developed and applied a domain-inferred prediction method to predict new ppis and identified their pathological targets on multiple organs overall our proposed ontology-based integrative framework combined with computational predictions can be used to support fundamental understanding of the intricate interactions between human patients and coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 and their association with various disease outcomes  human coronaviruses pose a huge threat to global public health the outbreak has led to significant morbidity mortality and economic damage worldwide 1 these crucial differences between sars-cov-2 and more benign coronaviruses are a function of specific adaptations that sars-cov-2 has made to the human host for example the immune-evasive character of sars-cov-2 enables the covid-19 pandemic to spread from asymptomatic individuals 13  because symptoms are primarily produced by the host immune response this spread from asymptomatic carriers is a key portion of covid-19s rapid spread ongoing inquiry into these specific adaptations is hampered by a lack of structured integrative resources with standard data and metadata formats deeper study of the interactions between hosts human and others and coronaviruses sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov and others would help our understanding of covid-19 mechanisms and rational design of vaccines and drugs against covid-19 however to achieve this goal two major bottlenecks exist first although intensive research has generated large amounts of data the data are multidimensional heterogeneous disintegrated and non-interoperable such data cannot be efficiently interpreted by computers preventing computer-assisted reasoning and analysis the second bottleneck is the lack of efficient computational algorithms and bioinformatics tools to integrate and analyze the heterogeneous data and knowledge into deep scientific understanding this bottleneck slows the integration of host-coronavirus interaction hci data discovery of hci mechanisms and new applications ontologies can solve these problems in analysis by integrating big data in a computer-interpretable way in the informatics field an ontology is a human-and computer-interpretable set of terms and relations that represent entities in a specific domain and how they relate to each other ontology has played an important role in standard knowledge and data representation integration sharing and analysis a major field of artificial intelligence is knowledge representation and reasoning kr krr and ontology is a foundation of the krr the coronavirus infectious disease ontology cido is a new communitybased biomedical ontology in the domain of coronavirus diseases httpsgithubcomcido-ontologycido 14  to better study the hci mechanisms to explain various covid-19 phenomena we propose to use cido as a platform for standard and computer-understandable representation of the host-coronavirus interactions and their influences on patient outcomes in this manuscript we introduce a set of hpi-outcome postulates laying out a set of basic rules for understanding host-pathogen interactions hpis and their roles in the disease outcomes then we propose a model to study the relations between hostcoronavirus interactions hcis and coronavirus disease outcomes we used our ontology-based strategy to annotate and classify human coronaviruses hosts and experimentally verified host-coronavirus interactions hcis obtained from literature mining and bioinformatics studies using these annotations we proposed an ontological model of the interactions between sars-cov-2 and human to explain how the human-sars-cov-2 interactions would induce different disease outcomes such as hypertension and cytokine storm furthermore using known ppis as baits we developed a computational method to predict new ppis and their associations with multi-organ disease phenotypes caused by sars-cov-2 interacions from the literature we manually annotated and identified coronavirus virulence factors and how host genesproteins interact with coronaviruses experimentally confirmed coronavirus virulence factors were added to the victors a manually curated web-based database and analysis system 15  ignet literature mining analysis the ignet interaction network tool httpignethegrouporg powered by our in-house sciminer 16 literature mining tool was used to mine gene-gene interactions in the specific domain of coronaviruses among the host genes were collected from the string database with a medium confidence score of 04 host species were mapped to ncbitaxon taxonomy ontology 17 and human phenotype ontology hpo 18  the disease phenotype outcomes including different symptoms and signs were mapped to hpo with these mapped terms ontofox 19 was used to generate subsets or slimes of the ncbitaxon or hpo ontologies prediction of host-coronavirus ppis we used a domain-inferred prediction method to infer inter-species ppis supported by the conservation and importance of domains in proteins 20  such domain-domain interaction ddi infers the potential interaction between two proteins if one domain in a pathogen protein a interacted with another domain in a host protein b visualization of host-coronavirus ppis cytoscape 21 was utilized for visualization of the coronavirus-human ppis kochs postulates 22 23 24 have long provided criteria designed to establish a causal relationship between exposure to a microbe and emergence of a disease the four criteria of kochs postulates are i the microbe must be found in all organisms suffering from the disease but should not be found in healthy organisms based on the hpi-outcome postulates we lay out the integrative host-coronavirus interaction framework as shown in figure 1  basically the framework includes three major processes from the viral side and three major processes from the host side for the coronaviruses crucial processes include viral entry to host cell viral replication and viral release from the infected cell for the host three responses exist the nave response the innate response and the adaptive response initially the host response to the coronavirus entry through a receptor-ligand interaction is nave since the host does not realize the danger and react to the virus by a routine procedure at this nave host response stage neither signalling molecules nor selected immune cell populations are yet present to coordinate an immune response as signalling molecules are produced by infected cells eg cytokines interferons the host will show a delayed innate responses to coronavirus infection the innate immune response may or may not become effective and strong against the viral infection eventually through a process of recombination followed by clonal selection in multiple immune cell subtypes the host will mount an adaptive immune response more effective against the viral infection  figure 1  each of the viral or host process includes many subprocesses and interactions dynamic hostvirus interactions can be used to explain disease outcomes according to their impact on these many subprocesses if the viruses wins the result will be the viral survival and replication if the host wins the host will eventually control viral replication and kill the viruses to model and analyze the complex adversarial interactions between host and pathogen we propose to apply ontology as an integrative and systematic platform due to the solid semantic logic behind ontology and its computer-interpretable nature we used ontology to represent coronavirus disease knowledge including the taxonomical structure of 9 coronaviruses in the ncbitaxon ontology a taxonomy ontology based on the ncbi taxonomy database 17  as shown in figure 2a  human coronaviruses infect and transmit among mammal hosts we identified over 10 organisms that can serve as hosts or reservoirs for human coronaviruses bats were found to be the reservoir of a wide variety of coronaviruses including sars-cov and mers-cov viruses 27  sars-cov was also found in masked palm civets and a raccoon dog and antibodies against sars-cov were also found in chinese ferret badgers in a live-animal market in shenzhen china 28  our analysis found many other animals that might have served as reservoir hosts of sars-cov  figure 2b  the mers-cov virus likely transmitted from dromedary camels 29  these host organisms can further be classified using the ncbitaxon ontology  figure 2b  all the host organisms belong to boreoeutheria a clade magnorder of placental mammals clades within boreoeutheria include euarchontoglires supraprimates including humans and rodents and laurasiatheria laurasiatheria includes artiodactyla even toed ungulates such as cattle and camels chiroptera bats and ferae carnivores such as canines felines and civets and relatives including pangolins  figure 2b  the taxonomy hierarchy was also extracted from the ncbitaxon ontology and become part of the cido our ncbitaxon-based ontology analysis of all these coronavirus hosts further shows that zoonotic human coronaviruses including sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are obligate mammal parasites  figure 2b  suggesting that some molecular factor distinguishes mammals from other animals to host and transmit coronaviruses to humans we hypothesize that zoonotic human coronaviruses such as sars-cov-2 can only originate in mammals in contrast to influenza which can transmit to humans from avians however this hypothesis will need substantial additional study a recent paper suggests snake as an intermediate host for human zoonotic coronavirus based on similarity in codon usage bias with 2019-ncov eg sars-cov-2 30  since snakes are not mammals this would disprove our hypothesis but the overall pattern makes the proposed transmission via snakes an extreme claim thus requiring extreme evidence according to us cdc the common symptoms of covid-19 include fever cough shortness of breath or difficulty breathing chills repeated shaking with chills muscle pain headache sore throat and new loss of taste or smell figure 3a is a hierarchical display of these 9 common symptoms and their associated hierarchical phenotype representation using the human phenotype ontology hpo 31  comorbidity is the presence of additional conditions such as a disease or phenotype that is concurrent with the coronavirus infection our further covid-19 annotation and analysis show that the patients with many comorbid conditions eg emphysema chronic bronchitis hypertension coronary heart disease and diabetes are at heightened risk for severe symptoms and death figure 3b shows comorbidities and the covid-19 outcome frequencies from case reports in peer-reviewed articles to analyze the host interactions leading to these outcomes it is very important to build data structures and data visualizations that can draw upon clinical electronic records clinical coronavirus disease outcomes result from host-coronavirus interactions we have collected 10 4 and 1 virulence factors from sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 respectively table 1 figure 4  table 1  based on our hpi-outcome postulates the model given in figure 1  and our literature mining results we generated an integrative framework to formally specify the interactions between host and sars-cov-2 factors with associated disease outcomes which can be attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin system ras pathway 32  as we know figure 3  patients with hypertension are more susceptible to death and severe outcomes this phenomenon can be explained if the down-regulation of the ace2 due to the infection is associated with hypertension  figure 5  specifically the downregulation of ace2 would lead to excessive production of angiotensin ii by ace which would then bind to its receptor and induce vasocontraction and hypertension 42  although ace and ace2 both act as key players in the ras they serve oppositional roles to angiotensin ii an angiotensin ii receptor blocker drug eg azilsartan would block the angiotensin ii binding to its receptor and thus help treat hypertension in this way the ontological model links host-pathogen interactions to the hypertension outcome if a patient already has hypertension the further increased blood pressure due to the interactions would exacerbate the underlying comorbidity which may explain the increased death rate of patients with superimposed covid and hypertension however other pathogen factors likely play a role in the extreme pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 this is evidenced by the fact that despite markedly weak pathogenicity hcov-nl63 a prevalent human coronavirus also uses an s-ace2 interaction for cellular entry 43  however hcov-nl63 is considerably more benign than sars-cov-2 this may be a consequence of molecular differences in the s protein-ace2 interaction between the two strains the ontology-driven comparative analysis of covs provides a formal representation for both similarities and differences among the s proteins from different viruses if the s proteins do not differ significantly we hypothesize that some other factor eg a co-receptor of sars-cov-2 contributes to viral binding and entry our recent vaccine design study 44 predicts many sars-cov-2 nonstructural proteins as possible adhesins some of which may serve as a possible co-receptor which are testable predictions a cytokine storm is an excessive immune response to external stimuli associated with high levels of cytokine production 45  cytokine storm is a major cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple-organ failure in severe covid-19 patients resulting in death within a short time 46  il-6 is a major cytokine involved in the cytokine storm 45  il-6 can be induced by the angiotensin ii in human cells 47  which links the cytokine storm to the s-ace2 binding-associated interaction network  figure 5  tocilizumab a recombinant humanized anti-human il-6 receptor monoclonal antibody can bind to the il-6 receptor with high affinity and thus prevent il-6 from binding to its native receptor and inducing downstream immune damage it was recently reported the tocilizumab improved the clinical outcome in severe and critical covid-19 patients and effectively reduced mortality 48  figure 5 provides a logical and structured graphical summary of the knowledge introduced above this representation covers knowledge learned from many studies without such an integrative representation it is difficult to put all the pieces together another unique feature of the figure 5 representation is that it is ontology-oriented so that all the terms and relations are represented using a computer-interpretable ontological format figure 5 is a subset of the comprehensive host-coronavirus interaction network which will be expanded as our understanding of host-interactions by the coronavirus grows to demonstrate the ontological representation the process sars-cov-2 s-ace2 binding can be defined by two logical axioms  figure 5  the above ontological logical axioms define the relations where a sars-cov-2 s-ace2 binding process has two participants a sars-cov-2 s protein that serves as a ligand role and an ace2 protein that serves as a receptor role in addition we can define a logical axiom between sars-cov-2 s-ace2 binding and tmprss2 that defines the role of tmprss2 to activate the sars-cov-2 s-ace2 binding process a major difference between ontology and taxonomy is that a taxonomy is built only based on the isa relation beside the representation of such isa relation ontology can also provide additional relations between entities under different hierarchies such as the above activates relation that links the tmprss2 protein in the protein hierarchy and the sars-cov-2 s-ace2 binding under the interaction process hierarchy the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines esp il-1b il-8 il-6 cxcl10 and ccl2 were detected in sars patients 52 53 54  indicating the initiation of a cytokine storm which is eventually associated with the progression to ards and death it is obvious that the timing here is critical the early ifn response would be beneficial however coronaviruses especially sars-cov-2 manipulate the immune system to delay such a response allowing widespread infection prior to an onset of symptoms the understanding of such dynamics helps our rational design of proper treatments and the timing of the treatments it appears that similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 also affects the ifn response 51 55  sars-cov-2 even displayed a higher sensitivity to ifn-i in vitro compared with sars-cov-1 in infected vero cells 56  the difference in terms of ifn-i activation between sars-cov and sar-cov-2 is likely due to the difference in the sequences for two proteins orf 3b and orf 6 of these two human coronaviruses 56  considering that different human coronaviruses induce varied phenotype outcomes it is important to include more coronaviruses in the systematic comparison and identify their differential action on ifn production and on isgs which likely plays a critical role in the delayed host recognition and responses to the infection supporting the survival and replication of the viruses inside the host our proposed hpi postulates combined with our structured ontology support an systems-level investigation into these mechanisms and into potential avenues of prophylaxis or treatment the second key component of the host response to coronavirus interaction is the activation of an adaptive host response which is also key to long term immunity the severe sars disease is also related to the lack of or delayed activation of adaptive immunity 42  the sars patients with severe outcomes maintained high levels of many innate immune system-linked cytokines eg cxcl10 ccl2 and isg-encoded proteins with low levels of spike-specific antibodies 57  conversely surviving patients had higher levels of spike-specific antibodies these findings suggest that the prompt formation of adaptive immunity is important to reduce disease severity and improve outcomes the adaptive immune response can be induced by effective vaccines against covid-19 both sars-cov and mers-cov s and s1 have been used as vaccine antigensimmunogens due to their ability to induce neutralizing antibodies that prevent host cell attachment and infection 44 58  numerous sars-cov-2 vaccine trials are underway 44  with the hope that a safe and effective vaccines will be ready in the near future to control the covid-19 pandemic our previous victors ppi predictions are based on the analyses of protein domains and phylogeny 15  by nature each ppi is a domain-domain interaction therefore we can identify the domains of virus proteins and based on known interactions with domains of host proteins predict how the virus proteins interact with host proteins using the known ppis as baits we developed a domain-inferred ppi prediction strategy to predict more ppis and how these ppis could possibly affect organs and tissues our prediction found that sars-cov-2 could induce 3111 human-virus interactions with 133 human proteins many ppis are tissue-specific and the tissue-specific information can be identified from the human protein atlas 59  using our predicted ppis sars-cov-2 was predicted to affect many tissues such as skin liver intestine blood glands and reproductive tissues  figure 6  in addition to computational methods the prediction described above also depends on prior knowledge of the pre-identified ppis and tissue-specific protein the intergrative ontological modeling can also support different applications such as rational drug repurposing design and vaccine development as shown in figure 5  our ontological representation provides several paths for rational drug repurposing design for covid-19 treatment camostat mesylate a serine protease inhibitor is capable of inhibiting the function of tmprss2 41  which is crucial for the effective s-ace2 binding tmprss2 41  angiotensin ii receptor blockers can be used to block the activation of the angiotensin ii 60  therefore blocking the vacoconstriction and following hypertension tocilizumab is able to inhibit il-6 activity 48 so block the formation of cytokine storm sars-cov-2 appears to use many pathways to cause different phenotypes it is reasonable to hypothesize that the drugs blocking early stages of the disease pathways would be more effective than the later starges of the pathways it is also important to consider drugs that block the paths leading to severe disease outcomes such as hypertension and cytokine storm in addition we also need to consider the side effects of the drugs being used for the treatment the integrative ontology framework provides a foundation for these rational design ontology-based software tools and algorithms can also be developed to support intelligence queries 61   renin-angiotensin system inhibitors improve the clinical outcomes of covid-19 patients with hypertension juan meng

a hypertension survey from 2012 to 2015 reported that 232 of chinese people 18 years of age had hypertension whereas the prevalence of hypertension was 55 among citizens 65 years of age 2 ras plays an important role in regulating electrolyte balance and blood pressure and comprises two pathways the aceang iiat1r pathway and the ace2ang 17mas receptor pathway 3 under normal physiological conditions the activity of the aceang iiat1r axis and the ace2ang 17mas receptor axis are in a dynamic equilibrium state maintaining the normal function of the corresponding system similar to sars sars-cov-2 is believed to invade the host through the cell entry receptor ace2 4 sars-cov infections reduce ace2 expression resulting in an imbalance between the aceang iiat1r axis and the ace2ang 17mas receptor axis 5 targeting the aceang iiat1r axis is a novel therapeutic strategy for hypertension aceis and aras not only inhibit the aceang iiat1r pathway but also modulate the ace2ang 17mas receptor pathway 6 the dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system ras has been observed in coronavirus infection disease covid-19 patients but whether ras inhibitors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceis and angiotensin ii type 1 receptor blockers arbs are associated with clinical outcomes remains unknown here we aimed to evaluate the ability of ras inhibitors to protect against covid-19 in patients with hypertension this study was approved by the shenzhen third peoples hospital ethical committee verbal informed consent was obtained from all patients or patients family members we performed a retrospective review of medical records from hospitalized patients with covid-19 admitted to the shenzhen third peoples hospital from 11 january to 23 february 2020 the information on patients with hypertension was extracted from all enrolled covid-19 patients we reviewed the clinical data extracted from electronic medical records including clinical symptoms signs and laboratory findings a commercial real-time pcr kit geneodx co ltd shanghai china was used to detect sars-cov-2 samples were considered positive if the cycle threshold value ct-value less than 37 and negative if ct-value more than 40 samples with a ct-value between 37 and 40 require confirmation by retesting samples identified as positive by the local laboratory were further validated by the key laboratory of the shenzhen cdc the severity of covid-19 wasidentified during the hospitalization according to the guidelines established by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china therapeutic regimens for covid-19 patients complied with guidelines established by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china hypertension was classified as grade 1 grade 2 and grade 3 according to 2018 guidelines of the european society of hypertension esh hypertensive patients with covid-19 were divided into two subgroups based on antihypertensive drug treatments detailed information on the enrolled patients is shown in supplementary table s1 the spss 180 software package was used for statistical analysis measurement data are expressed as the median and interquartile range iqr and the difference between groups was compared by an unpaired t test count data are expressed as percentages and the difference between groups was tested by the chi-square test p  005 was considered statistically significant a total of 417 covid-19 patients were admitted to the shenzhen third peoples hospital as of 23 february 2020 among these patients 51 1223 had hypertension nine patients 176 with grade 1hypertension did not take any antihypertensive drugs during hospitalization and were excluded from the subsequent analysis the other 42 patients 824 receiving antihypertensive therapy were included in further studies the 42 analyzed patients were divided into two groups based on antihypertensive therapies the aceiarb group 17 patients included patients treated with acei or arb drugs and the non-aceiarb group 25 patients included patients treated with other antihypertensive drugs including calcium channel blockers ccbs -blockers and diuretics eight patients 32 in the non-aceiarb group and 5 patients 2941in the aceiarb group had other comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes t2d and coronary heart disease chd the vast majority of hypertensive patients had received the current therapeutic regimens shown in supplementary table s1 for over one year the blood pressure of patients was well-controlled with the above therapeutic regimens during hospitalization the comparison of baseline characteristics between the two groups is summarized in supplementary table s2 the median age of the analyzed subjects was 645 years iqr 558690 years and 571 of them were males no significant differences in hypertension grades were observed between the aceiarb group and the non-aceiarb group both groups showed similar signs and symptoms the median number of days from the onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 20 in the non-aceiarb group and 30 in the aceiarb group meanwhile the median number of days from symptom onset to hospital discharge was 165 days in the non-aceiarb group and 200 days in the aceiarb group the median heart rate and respiratory rate from the non-aceiarb group were 905 bpm and 200 respectively in comparison the median heart rate and respiratory rate from the non-aceiarb group were 800 bmp and 200 respectively all baseline characteristics shown in table s2 were not significantly different between the two groups during hospitalization 12 patients in the non-aceiarb group 48 were categorized into severe subgroups and one patient died in contrast in the aceiarb group only 4 patients 235 were categorized into severe subgroups and no patients died figure 1a the percentage of severe cases in the aceiarb group was higher than that in the non-aceiarb group but this difference was not significant possibly due to the small number of clinical cases we next examined the effects of taking acei or arb drugs on laboratory findings of covid-19 patients with hypertension as shown in figure 1b there was a trend toward lower il-6 levels in patients from the aceiarb group no marked variation in c-reactive protein crp was observed between the two groups figure 1b the absolute number of cd3 and cd8 t cells in the aceiarb group was significantly higher than that in the non-aceiarb group there were no significant changes in cd4 t cell counts between the two groups figure 1c in addition although the viral load was not different between the two groups at hospital admission the peak viral load during hospitalization in the aceiarb group was significantly lower than that in the non-aceiarb group figure 1d other laboratory findings such as white blood cell counts neutrophil counts platelet counts and lactate dehydrogenase are shown in supplementary table s3 and no significant differences were observed between the two groups
 it was reported that the ras plays a critical role in regulating hypertension and acute lung injury caused by viruses such as sars and h7n9 57 changes in ras activity are related to the pathogenesis of hypertension and inflammatory lung disease targeting ras is an effective antihypertension therapeutic strategy aceis and arb which inhibit the aceang iiat1r system are commonly used drugs for hypertensive patients recent evidence suggests that hypertensive covid-19 patients are predisposed to develop severe cases 1 thus it is important to determine the effect of ras inhibitors on covid-19 patients with hypertension studies have suggested that covid-19 patients have increased angiotensin ii compared to healthy people 8 the abnormal increase in angiotensin ii was related to hypertension and lung failure in addition ras inhibitors have been shown to be associated with reduced mortality in patients with sepsis 9 angiotensin ii positively regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines through the activation of at1r 10 excessively high levels of inflammatory cytokines are harmful to the outcomes of covid-19 patients thus it was suggested that it is beneficial for covid-19 patients to use aceisarbs to inhibit the ras however until now no confirmed clinical evidence has been available in this study covid-19 patients with hypertension were enrolled and we found that aceiarb therapy attenuated the inflammatory response potentially through the inhibition of il-6 levels which is consistent with the findings that acei and arb therapy alleviated lps-induced pneumonic injury 11 for patients with chronic heart failure it has been proven that acei therapy was associated with decreased th1th2 cytokine ratios and inflammatory cytokine production 12 this study also suggests that aceiarb therapy had a beneficial effect on the immune system by avoiding peripheral t cell depletion furthermore the viral load was reported to be highly correlated with severe lung injury 8 it was also observed that aceiarb therapy decreased the viral load but we hypothesize that ras inhibitors do not directly inhibit viral replication rather they play an indirect antiviral role by regulating immune function and inhibiting inflammatory responses and the mechanism needs to be clarified through in vitro and in vivostudies in the future taken together this is the first clinical evidence demonstrating that ras inhibitors improve the clinical outcomes of covid-19 patients with hypertension suggesting that these patients could benefit from the persistent or preferential usage of aceiarb for antihypertensive treatment  interactions of coronaviruses with ace2 angiotensin ii and ras inhibitorslessons from available evidence and insights into covid-19 hisashi kai mamiko kai   a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was discovered in december 2019 in wuhan china and an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has been spreading around the world as of early april 2020 the clinical spectrum of covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic upper respiratory infection to critically ill pneumonia associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 13 in initial reports from china the prevalence of older age hypertension diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease cvd was high in covid-19 patients and individuals with these comorbidities tended to have greater case fatality rates 3 4 in addition it has been shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is a functional receptor for sars-cov-2 infection 57 given that experimental studies suggested that angiotensin receptor blockers arbs and an ace inhibitor acei could increase ace2 expression in cardiovascular and renal systems 820 concerns may have been raised regarding whether arbs and aceis would augment the infection of sars-cov-2 and the severity of covid-19 in hypertension and cvd patients receiving these drugs 21 in contrast arbs have potential benefits in the prevention and treatment of lung injury caused by covid-19 22 these conflicting views appear to arise based on the results of experimental studies especially those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov because direct clinical data on covid-19 are lacking at present sars-cov caused the sars epidemic in china in 20022003 and its virological characteristics are closely related to those of sars-cov-2 23 24 here available investigations on the association of the reninangiotensin system ras particularly ace2 and angiotensin ii with sars-cov-induced lung injury and the latest information on covid-19 were reviewed as of early april 2020 which would provide insight into covid-19 and the direction of future research on covid-19 ace2 belongs to the membrane-bound carboxydipeptidase family and is widely distributed in the human body including the heart kidney small intestine and to a lesser extent the lung lung ace2 expression is concentrated mainly in type ii alveolar cells and macrophages and modestly in bronchial and tracheal epithelial cells 25 ace2 degrades angiotensin ii to generate angiotensin 1-7 which activates the mas oncogene receptor that negatively regulates a variety of angiotensin ii actions mediated by angiotensin ii type 1 receptor at1r 26 therefore it is thought that the ace2angiotensin 1-7mas receptor axis has counteracting effects against the excessively activated aceangiotensin iiat1r axis as seen in hypertension cardiac hypertrophy heart failure and other cvds 26 on the other hand human ace2 is an established functional receptor by which sars-cov enters host target cells fig 1 23 24 the transmembrane spike glycoprotein s protein of sars-cov binds to the cellular membrane ace2 sars-cov then attaches to the target cells followed by sars-cov-s protein priming by cellular surface proteases such as transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 allowing the fusion of viral and cellular membranes and resulting in sars-cov entry and replication in the target cells 6 moreover ace2 knockout greatly reduces viral infection and replication in mice after experimental sars-cov infection 27 thus it is suggested that the binding of the sars-cov-s protein to ace2 is crucial for sars-cov infection recently it has been shown that the sars-cov-2-s protein shares nearly 80 amino acid identity with the sars-cov-s protein and the binding affinity of the sars-cov-2-s protein to human ace2 is similar to that of the sars-cov-s protein 57 anti-human ace2 antibodies or antisera can inhibit sars-cov-2-s protein-mediated entry into cultured cells in vitro 57 accordingly sars-cov-2 utilizes ace2 for target cell entry as well however it is still not clear whether ace2 is the sole receptor for sars-cov-2 infection because cd209l a glycoprotein of c-type lectin also called l-sign is identified as a possible secondary receptor for sars-cov in cultured chinese hamster ovary cells 28 experimental sars-cov infection induces acute respiratory failure and lung parenchymal injury characterized by alveolar wall thickening pulmonary vascular hyperpermeability and inflammatory cell infiltration in mice 27 after sars-cov infection in mice lung ace2 protein levels are greatly reduced while ace levels are not changed 27 these findings are consistent with the previous observation that coronaviruses specifically downregulate ace2 expression in host cells depending on virus replication 29 in addition sars-cov-induced acute lung injury is remarkably attenuated in ace2 knockout mice compared with wild-type mice 27 lung angiotensin ii levels increase in wild-type mice after sars-cov infection 27 acid aspiration mice an ards model show functional and pathological changes mimicking sars-cov-induced lung injury 30 the lung angiotensin ii levels increase after acid aspiration and sars-cov-s protein treatment elicits a further angiotensin ii increase 27 interestingly exogenous recombinant ace2 treatment rescues acid aspiration-induced acute lung injury 30 taking this evidence together the following hypothesis has been raised for the mechanism underlying sars-cov-induced lung injury sars-cov infection downregulates lung ace2 and in turn shifts the balance toward the dominance of the aceangiotensin iiat1r system over the ace2angiotensin 1-7mas receptor system in the lung as a result noncompeting angiotensin ii accumulation occurs resulting in acute lung injury through at1r activation 27 it should be noted that a similar mechanism is proposed for the severe lung injury caused by the avian influenza a virus h5n1 which has spread worldwide in humans with a high mortality rate after h5n1 virus infection in mice lung ace2 expression is downregulated and serum angiotensin ii levels increase 31 acute lung injury is augmented by ace2 knockout in h5n1-infected mice while the administration of recombinant human ace2 ameliorates h5n1-induced lung injury in mice 31 moreover in other mouse models of acute lung injuryards such as acid aspiration sepsis and drug-induced lung fibrosis it has been shown that ace2 expression is downregulated in response to noxious stimuli and that acute lung injury is aggravated by ace2 knockout and rescued by exogenous ace2 administration or at1r knockout 30 32 accordingly it is suggested that the angiotensin iiat1r-induced aggravation resulting from ace2 downregulation and the protective effects of ace2 are not specific to lung injury in sars but rather may be common to acute lung injuryards induced by various viral infections and lung diseases several kinds of arbs eg olmesartan telmisartan losartan and azilsartan have been shown to increase the mrna or protein levels of ace2 in animal models of heart diseases hypertensive hypertrophy autoimmune myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy myocardial infarction and diabetic cardiomyopathy 814 and chronic kidney disease hypertensive nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy 15 16 as well as normal rat heart and renal vasculature 17 18 and hypertensive rat aorta but not the carotid artery 19 20 acei does not inhibit ace2 as a pharmacological property in normal rats lisinopril has been shown to modestly increase cardiac ace2 mrna levels while not changing cardiac ace2 activity 17 in the myocardial infarction model valsartan ramipril and their combination have no effects on cardiac ace2 expression 33 it should be noted that the doses of arbs and aceis used in these animal studies were much greater than those in clinical practice so that the observed effects of these drugs on ace2 expression and activity could not be extrapolated to clinical situations in humans importantly no clinical data exist regarding the effects of arbs and aceis on human tissue ace2 expression or activity in vivo although there are several clinical studies investigating the changes in plasma or urine levels of the soluble form of ace2 in hypertension and cvd patients receiving arbs or aceis the soluble form of ace2 in the plasma and urine is not a reliable indicator of the activity of tissue ace2 namely membrane-bound ace2 22 importantly there are no data on the effects of arbs and aceis on lung ace2 expression either in animal models or humans it is still unknown whether the changes in ace2 levels for example arb-induced upregulation actually facilitate greater engagement and entry of sars-cov and other viruses even in animal models on the other hand it has been shown that pretreatment with losartan an arb ameliorates acute pulmonary edema and lung injury in sars-cov-s protein-treated mice after acid aspiration fig 2 27 taken together with the lung angiotensin ii level elevation 27 this evidence suggested that even after considering the speculation that viral load would be enhanced by ace2 upregulation the net effects of arbs would be favorable to prevent sars-cov-induced acute lung injury in this model in addition there is another possibility that the arb pretreatment-induced baseline ace2 increase prior to sars-cov infection would result in higher ace2 levels that remained after sars-cov-induced downregulation and consequently conferred protection against lung injury in this model 22 34 however in interpreting the results of this study it should be noted that the effects of losartan have been observed merely in mice treated with sars-cov-s protein in addition to acid aspiration but not in mice treated with sars-cov-s protein alone additionally data on lung ace2 levels before and after treatment with sars-cov-s protein and acid aspiration are lacking in mice pretreated with or without losartan earlier studies reported that the case fatality rate was high in covid-19 patients with comorbidities such as older age hypertension diabetes mellitus cvd chronic pulmonary disease and malignancy 3 4 because patients with hypertension and cvd are likely treated with aceis or arbs the concern is raised regarding whether the use of aceis and arbs may aggravate the morbidity and mortality of covid-19 21 however it was possible that the observed phenomenon would result from reverse causality because older patients are at the highest risk for covid-19 and concurrently tend to have multiple comorbidities including hypertension and cvd and because adjustments for age and other possible confounding factors were not performed in such earlier studies 22 35 36 indeed in a recent retrospective multicenter cohort study enrolling 191 confirmed covid-19 patients in wuhan china multivariable regression analysis revealed that independent risk factors for in-hospital death are older age higher sequential organ failure assessment score and higher d-dimer levels at the early stage of covid-19 although hypertension diabetes and coronary artery disease were not included 37 a small case study reported that plasma angiotensin ii levels were markedly elevated and linearly associated with viral load and lung injury severity in covid-19 pneumonia patients 38 given that a remarkable elevation of circulating levels was also documented in various kinds of cytokines il-6 il-10 tnf-alpha etc it is unknown whether these findings of angiotensin ii are the cause or result of a systemic cytokine storm in covid-19 patients 39 in the context of the effects of arbs and aecis a retrospective single-center analysis enrolling 112 covid-19 patients showed that the use of arbs and aceis had no effects on the morbidity and mortality of covid-19 patients with cvd 40 currently a case-control study is underway to clarify the effects of aceis and arbs on the severity of covid-19 in italy nct04318418 most importantly at present there is no large-scale study with convincing evidence to determine whether arbs and aceis play a neutral beneficial or harmful role in the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 and the severity and outcomes of covid-19 patients 22 3436 41 in addition to vaccine development and antiviral agents the modulation of the ras especially by ace2 and angiotensin ii is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target for covid-19 based on an animal study suggesting the beneficial net effects of arb in sars-cov-infected acute lung injury mice 27 multicenter double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized trials rcts are currently being conducted to investigate the effects of losartan on mortality and hospital admission in covid-19 patients requiring hospital admission nct04312009 and not requiring hospital admission nct04311177 respectively recombinant ace2 is another candidate to prevent covid-19 pneumonia as described above the efficacy of exogenous recombinant ace2 has been shown in animal models of acute lung injuryards 30 31 it is also possible that the circulating soluble form of ace2 may act as a decoy receptor that binds to sars-cov-2 and competitively inhibits virus entry to host target cells mediated by membrane-bound ace2 to investigate the efficacy of human recombinant ace2 in the treatment of covid-19 patients a randomized controlled pilot clinical study was planned nct04287686 however this study was withdrawn on march 17 2020 tmprss2 is a membrane protease for ace2 priming which is a crucial step for the fusion of sars-cov-2 and target cell membranes and the resultant viral entry into the cells 6 nafamostat mesylate and camostat mesylate are tmprss2 inhibitors that have been used for the treatment of acute pancreatitis in japan currently a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of nafamostat and camostat for treating covid-19 is underway in japan httpswwwu-tokyoacjpfocusenarticlesz050800083html the concern regarding whether arbs and aceis may have harmful effects on the morbidity and mortality of covid-19 patients is based on the speculation that these drugs would upregulate ace2 a receptor for sars-cov-2 which would increase the viral load and then augment lung injury however the evidence of ace2 upregulation is limited only in animal studies using the relatively high namely pharmacological doses of several arbs and one acei additionally it remains unclear whether the arbace-induced ace2 increase actually enhances the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 or sar-cov importantly no clinical studies exist supporting that arbs and aceis augment susceptibility to infection and worsen or improve all-cause and cardiovascular outcomes in not only covid-19 patients but also sars patients at present therefore the hypothesis underlying the concern would not be readily extrapolated to humans particularly to covid-19 patients in patients with heart failure prior myocardial infarction other cvds and cerebrovascular disease the benefit of arbs and aceis has been established in the improvement of quality of life and survival outcomes while the discontinuation leads to new onset or exacerbation of heart failure cvd and stroke and the worsening of the prognosis 42 thus ras inhibitors should be continued in high-risk patients who have received guideline-directed medical therapy gdmt in general switching from one to another class of antihypertensive agents does not infrequently result in destabilization of blood pressure control and requires frequent visits for drug titration to achieve appropriate and stable blood pressure control and to avoid adverse effects blood pressure destabilization increases the incidence of heart failure stroke and other cvds in addition frequent visits to the clinic or hospital expose patients to a greater risk of infection in a covid-19 pandemic situation accordingly even in stably controlled hypertension patients without compelling indications it is thought that not only simple discontinuation but also switching from arb or acei to other antihypertensive agents should be avoided unless physicians make a decision based on specific considerations cardiovascular comorbidities are common in covid-19 patients and such patients are at great risk for morbidity and mortality 14 myocardial damage ranging from silent troponin t elevation to fulminant myocarditis has been documented in covid-19 patients 35 in confirmed or suspected covid-19 patients acei and arb medications are recommended for the treatment of heart failure and other cvd according to gdmt based on the available evidence at this time 35 in conclusion at present the use of arbs and aecis should not be withheld in established standard therapy for not only high-risk patients such as those with heart failure prior myocardial infarction other cvd and cerebrovascular disease but also patients with hypertension in stable condition according to the recent statements released by the european society of hypertension the european society of cardiology and the american heart associationheart failure society of americaamerican college of cardiology 4345 the evidence on covid-19 is being accumulated each day large-scale clinical studies with convincing evidence not only rcts but also real-world big data analyses as well as experimental studies are awaited to solve the question of whether arbs and aceis have neutral favorable or harmful effects on the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 and the severity and outcomes of covid-19 finally we should learn from the lessons of covid-19 without being bound by common sense in the ante-covid-19 era in addition we should reconstruct a novel strategy for the treatment of hypertension and cvd in the post-covid-19 era  influence of covid-19 on cerebrovascular disease and its possible mechanism hongyang fan xiaojia tang yuxia song peipei liu yingzhu chen   in december 2019 a group case of unexplained pneumonia occurred in wuhan hubei province china1 with the spread of the epidemic cases have consecutively appeared in other parts of china and abroad on april 10 2020 the number of countries involved has tripled with 1521252 cases worldwide and 85054 deaths2 the epidemic has resulted in serious negative effects on health and socioeconomic development on march 11 2020 who declared covid-19 as a pandemic3 the agent of the disease is a novel coronavirus on february 11 2020 the international committee on virus classification officially termed the virus sars-cov-2 it was formerly temporarily named 2019-ncov and the disease caused by novel coronavirus was termed corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus was uniformly named novel coronavirus pneumonia by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china the virus is the seventh member of envelope rna coronavirus sarbecovirus subgenus coronavirus subfamily novel coronavirus belongs to novel coronavirus of  genus with enveloped round or oval particles often pleomorphic and 60140 nm in diameter4 novel coronavirus is most similar to bat sars-like coronavirus from the chinese chrysanthemum-headed bat with nucleotide homology of 84 78 and 50 with bat sars-like coronavirus human sars virus and mers virus respectively5 the most primitive host of novel coronavirus is the chinese chrysanthemum-headed bat6 diseases are caused by spread from pangolin hosts to humans of the first 41 confirmed cases 27 reported contact with the south china seafood market1 therefore at present it is believed that the original source of novel coronavirus was the south china seafood market in wuhan and the source of infection was patients infected by novel coronavirus further asymptomatic infections and incubation periods are considered potential sources of infection7 the route of transmission is droplet contact aerosol fecal-oral andor mother-to-child transmission812 the average incubation period was 52 days and the basic regeneration number r0 in the early stage of the epidemic was 2213 clinical symptoms include fever cough myalgia or fatigue atypical symptoms include expectoration headache hemoptysis and diarrhea approximately half of patients have dyspnea complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome acute heart injury and secondary infection1 chest ct revealed that the most common radiological manifestations on admission were ground glass shadow and bilateral patchy shadow14 novel coronavirus cases are often complicated with high risk of cerebrovascular diseases such as cardio-cerebrovascular disease hypertension and diabetes15 or death occurring mainly in elderly and chronically ill patients16 according to the influence of novel coronavirus on cerebrovascular disease and the clinical manifestations of covid-19 patients this paper expounds on the pathophysiological hypothesis of covid-19 s effect on cerebrovascular disease based on the current epidemiological data people of all ages are generally susceptible to novel coronavirus the latest findings published in the chinese journal of epidemiology are based on the findings of 72314 cases of covid-1917 the majority of confirmed cases are between the ages of 30 to 79 years 866 mainly middle-aged and elderly individuals the proportion of patients with hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease is 128 53 and 42 respectively indicating that middle-aged and elderly individuals with chronic diseases may be more likely to be infected compared with healthy individuals stroke patients are mainly middle-aged and elderly individuals with a higher proportion of diseases such as hypertension and diabetes thus the elderly individuals with chronic diseases and individuals with poor resistance may be more susceptible to infection a recent study on the clinical characteristics of 138 patients with novel coronavirus infection in wuhan15 revealed that the median age was 56 years old with a higher proportion of middle-aged and elderly people of cases 64 were complicated with underlying diseases including 14 cases of diabetes 43 cases of hypertension 27 cases of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases and 10 cases of cancer this study demonstrated that elderly patients with cerebrovascular diseases and risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes may be at the highest risk of infection zhong nanshans team reported that the median age of critical recombination was 52 years old and that of the non-critical group was 45 years old males accounted for 5810 females accounted for 4190 and patients under 15 years old accounted for 09 suggesting that the rate of infection is higher in males than in females and infection in children is rare approximately a quarter of patients have hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease and other diseases further the proportion of patients with smoking history is less than 1518 collectively these data suggest that the elderly with cerebrovascular diseases may be more infectious than other groups when these patients were admitted to the hospital only 431 of the patients had a fever and more patients presented with a fever while in hospital conversely almost all patients with sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers both caused by coronavirus had symptoms of fever at the time of diagnosis and only 12 of the patients had no fever the case fatality rate of covid-19 is lower than that of sars and mers covid-19 is associated with a mortality rate of approximately 211 the case fatality rates of sars and mers were 96 and 34 respectively1920 the study reported that elderly patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases diabetes and hypertension had a higher case fatality rate than other populations blackburn et al21 reported that respiratory virus infection is associated with an increased risk of stroke in hospitalized stroke patients the existing studies suggest that novel coronavirus is not conducive to the prognosis of patients with cerebrovascular diseases and special attention should be paid to changes in their clinical condition hematological reports of covid-19 patients often include counts of white blood cells and neutrophils and high c-reactive protein common complications include the presence of inflammatory reactions covid-19 patients with cerebrovascular diseases often present with complications such as hypertension diabetes hyperlipidemia and other stroke risk factors these risk factors are associated with pro-inflammatory changes including leukocyte activation and cerebrovascular thrombosis under inflammatory stimulation inflammatory cells begin to accumulate in the vascular wall in the early stage of atherosclerosis increase blood-brain barrier permeability destroy brain cells and activate the formation of atherosclerosis in the anterior and internal cerebral arteries endothelial dysfunction affects the automatic regulation of cerebral circulation these processes may lead to plaque rupture and thrombosis increasing the risk of stroke inflammatory markers such as leukocytes fibrinogen and c-reactive protein are independent predictors of ischemic stroke22 long-term chronic infection can increase the risk of stroke in a casecontrol study23 acute infection in the previous week was reported to be a trigger for ischemic stroke acute and aggravated chronic infections may play a role by activating blood clotting and chronic infection and may lead to atherosclerosis inflammatory reactions in patients with covid-19 may be a critical common determinant of atherosclerosis and stroke risk when an individual is infected with novel coronavirus individuals with immune function may experience excessive systemic immune responses and even die of acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock24 this mechanism is termed immunopathogenicity in which the virus stimulates immunity and causes the immune system to attack itself currently it is critical to avoid excessive immune responses in the whole body as well as improve the immune function of individuals with weak immunity cytokine storm is an over-activation of the immune system caused by infection which leads to massive accumulation and exudation of inflammatory substances leading to multiple organ failure and acute respiratory distress this may be an important cause of death in severe and critical patients with covid-1925 accumulating evidence suggests that severe covid-19 patients might present with cytokine storm syndrome26 although the symptoms of most patients with coronavirus infection are mild at present some patients present with milder symptoms in the early stage which rapidly worsen in the later stage these patients eventually die of multiple organ failure which is mainly due to the cytokine storm cytokines include interferon ifn interleukin il chemokine chemokines colony stimulating factor csf and tumor necrosis factor tnf which are secreted by immune cells cytokines can have either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects when sars swept through china in 2003 the cytokine storm was also a direct cause of death in many patients27 in 2009 excessive inflammation was observed in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by h1n1a infection28 the toxicity of the virus depends on the severity of the induced immune response however different viruses trigger cytokine storms via various mechanisms as such they cause different cytokine changes for example sars-related cytokine storms are mainly related to interleukin il-1 il6 il12 interferon ifn-  inducible protein ip-10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-129 in contrast cytokine storms caused by mers coronavirus are mainly associated with ifn  tumour necrosis factor tnf-  il15 and il1730 in the above-mentioned study doctors at wuhan zhongnan hospital observed that the blood levels of il2 il7 il10 granulocyte colony stimulating factor gscf mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein mip-1 and tnf- in critically ill patients were significantly increased suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity1 low levels of cd4t and cd8t and higher levels of il-6 and il-10 were observed in severe patients in this regard t cell subsets and cytokines are positively correlated with the severity of covid-2019 symptoms31 on january 25 the lancet published an online paper on novel coronavirus32 coronavirus shows neuroinvasive characteristics secondary to peripheral organ replication in humans and animals the invasion of the blood-brain barrier by coronavirus is related to the destruction of tight junctions of brain microvascular endothelial cells induced by coronavirus which leads to blood-brain barrier dysfunction and enhanced blood-brain barrier permeability33 researchers detected sars-cov nucleic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with sars34 after invading brain tissue sars virus attracts cd68 monocytesmacrophages and cd3t lymphocytes to infected tissues through mixed cells to participate in the immune process however a large number of cytokineschemokines are released after a viral infection which induces an inflammatory cascade reaction and promotes atherosclerosis plaque rupture and thrombosis35 toll-like receptor tlr is activated after coronavirus infection which plays an important role in the mechanism of innate immunity and can promote atherosclerosis and accelerate the occurrence of ischemic stroke936 cytokine cascade aggravates ischemic brain damage and increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage after tissue plasminogen activator treatment37 il-6 can contribute to increased probability of a thrombotic event induction of platelet production and promotion of plaque disruption38 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the cellular receptor for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 the spike protein s1 interacts with the host ace2 receptor for adherence of viral particles to the cell membrane3941 in sars ace2 signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of severe lung failure after viral infection42 ace2 is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells heart kidney liver digestive tract and other organs43 tissues and organs expressing ace2 may be sites of interaction between novel coronavirus and immune cells ace2 is a negative regulator of renin-angiotensin system ras which can balance many functions of ace by targeting angiotensin ii ang ii ace2 shows protective effects in the cardiovascular system and many other organs44 ace2 deficiency impaired endothelial function in cerebral arteries in adult mice and augmented endothelial dysfunction during aging45 indicating that ace2 provides endothelial protection ace2 inactivates ang ii while generating angiotensin ang 17 and exerts potent vasodilator effects via activation of the mas receptor46 ace2 is an important metabolic enzyme in ras which plays a central role in maintaining heart and brain homeostasis46 sars-cov infections and spike protein of sars-cov reduce ace2 expression47 a decrease in ace2 is associated with a decrease in ang 1-7 which has vasoprotective effects the balance between the classical ras ace-ang ii-angiotensin 1 receptor at1r regulatory axis and the ace2-ang 1-7-masr counter-regulatory axis in the ras system is disturbed leading to higher ang ii levels in the blood angii levels in covid-19 patients are markedly elevated and linearly associated with viral load and lung injury48 ang ii stimulates nuclear factor- b nf-b activation in human monocytes nf-b participates in most signaling pathways involved in inflammation of atherosclerosis which may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis49 angiotensin 17 stimulates mas receptors to promote angiogenesis in brain tissue inhibit oxidative stress resist neuroinflammation improve cerebral blood flow and resist apoptosis50 therefore ace2 as a target receptor can inhibit the beneficial effects of the ras system in the brain due to ace2 involvement in blood pressure regulation a subset of hypertensive patients with covid-19 may present with an abnormal increase in blood pressure and increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage in addition critically ill patients with covid-19 are often associated with severe thrombocytopenia which may be risk factors for acute cerebrovascular events in these patients therefore we assume that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors acei and at1r inhibitors may be used to reduce pulmonary inflammation and mortality in patients with covid-19 pneumonia under conditions of controlled blood pressure5152 however experiments in animals revealed that acei and angiotensin receptor blockers increase the number of ace2 receptors in the cardiopulmonary circulation which increases the risk of severe disease outcomes53 clinical studies have demonstrated that blood of covid-19 patients contained higher levels of d-dimer and prolonged prothrombin time15 reflecting a hypercoagulable state of blood pulmonary infection is related to platelet aggregation and activation of the coagulation system54 significantly increased levels of d-dimer in severe covid-19 patients were observed5556 indicating that a hypercoagulable state may be an important marker of critical illness in covid-19 patients a clinical study demonstrated that anticoagulant therapy may be associated with superior prognosis in severe covid-19 patients with markedly elevated d-dimer levels57 decreased blood oxygen saturation leads to the release of inflammatory factors58 one possible explanation for the increase in blood coagulability is that a decrease in blood oxygen triggers inflammatory factors catecholamine increased plasma levels of tissue factors and platelet aggregation which alter capillary blood flow due to increased sympathetic activity and more widespread micro-endothelial damage resulting in blood coagulability59 if covid-19 patients remain in a prolonged state of hypoxia production of erythropoietin may increase causing secondary polycythemia increased hematocrit levels increased blood viscosity and slowing of blood flow60 more of these patients are concurrently complicated with risk factors of cerebrovascular disease1532 making them more prone to embolic vascular events and increasing the probability of acute ischemic stroke covid-19 patients often present with hypoxemia due to respiratory dysfunction1561 the features of sever patients is acute respiratory distress syndrome62 when bodily oxygen content changes the brain is the first organ to be affected63 resulting in a series of pathophysiological changes hypoxia can dilate intracranial blood vessels and increase intracranial blood flow cerebral capillary pressure tissue fluid production brain free radicals membrane lipid peroxidation and endogenous inhibitors these effects may impact cell energy metabolism6465 anaerobic glycolysis in the brain produces increased lactic acid and oxygen free radicals and lipid peroxides weakened antioxidant system and blood-brain barrier dysfunction66 metabolic acidosis caused by hypoxia increases cerebral vasospasm and permeability leading to interstitial brain edema intracranial hypertension67 and decreased atp production caused by hypoxia this initiates an injury cascade encompassing intracellular ca2 overload glutamate excitotoxicity and oxido-nitrosative stress culminating in neuronal and astroglial necrosis apoptosis and neurocognitive deficits68 the diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on suspected cases and provide any one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence 1 real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr for sars-cov-2 2 genome sequencing of the coronavirus showed highly homogeneity with the sars-cov-2 3 positive for the specific igm antibody and igg antibody to sars-cov-2 in serum test or sars-cov-2 specific igg antibody changes from negative to positive or titer rising 4 times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase69 at present there is a lack of effective treatments for covid-19 virus infection clinical research is underway for an effective therapeutic but the most effective immediate action involves scientific prevention and isolation people of all ages are not resistant to novel coronavirus and may be infected if transmission conditions are satisfied however the elderly and individuals with cerebrovascular diseases are at risk therefore prevention and control in these populations are particularly important presently the most effective way to treat the disease is to control the source of infection use personal protective measures to reduce the risk of transmission and protect vulnerable groups it is suggested that the elderly and individuals with cerebrovascular diseases should reduce their outdoor activities ensure good personal protection and hygiene maintain good living habits take the initiative to monitor the health of individuals and family members ventilate and disinfect their rooms frequently take medicine regularly eat healthily and maintain a positive mindset if symptoms such as fever cough sore throat chest tightness and muscle soreness are present individuals should undergo timely diagnosis isolation and treatment when treating and nursing patients medical staff have closer contact with patients and hence a higher risk of infection among the 138 consecutive patients admitted to zhongnan hospital of wuhan university from january 1 to 28 the proportion of medical staff was as high as 2915 a retrospective analysis of 1099 patients diagnosed with covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces revealed that the proportion of medical staff was 20918 when providing medical services for diagnosed patients or individuals suspected of infection medical staff should wear goggles protective clothing and other additional protective measures to strengthen their own protection and prevent cross-infection7071 there is currently a lack of specific antiviral drugs for novel coronavirus clinically most patients are mainly treated with empirical antiviral anti-infective glucocorticoid drugs andor supportive care for the most critically ill patients1672 nevert heless none of these approaches have resulted in curative effects therefore for covid-19 patients with cerebrovascular diseases personalized medication should be used according to the individual factors of the patients in addition to covid-19 symptoms it is necessary to concurrently strengthen treatments for basic cerebrovascular diseases to effectively reduce covid-19-associated mortality and improve prognosis the main treatment principle of cerebrovascular disease is to treat reversible etiology control risk factors and reduce complications general treatment includes bed rest monitoring vital signs finger oxygen saturation symptomatic support treatment and maintaining water electrolytes acidbase balance and stability of the internal environment the negative psychological impact of quarantine is evident73 and psychological support may be conducive to symptom improvement of this disease antiviral therapies74 such as interferon-alpha 5 million u per dose or equivalent for adults 2 ml of sterilized water for injection twice a day nebulized inhalation lopinavirritonavir two tablets per administration twice a day for no more than 10 days ribavirin recommended in combination with interferon or lopinavirritonavir 500 mg for adults two to three times a day intravenous infusion course of treatment no more than 10 days chloroquine phosphate 500 mg twice a day for adults no more than 10 days and abidol 200 mg three times a day for adults no more than 10 days have been indicated nevertheless it is not recommended to use three or more antiviral drugs concurrently and the use of related drugs should be stopped if intolerable side effects are experienced convalescent plasma therapy is suitable for patients with rapid progression severe and critical illness shufeng jiedu capsule sfjdc a traditional chinese medicine may also improve the condition7475 recently a retrospective study of influenza sars and mers published in the lancet reported that the use of glucocorticoids in patients with sars and mers viral infection did not improve prognosis but caused problems such as delayed cure secondary infections and osteoporosis therefore it is recommended that glucocorticoids should not be used in the treatment of new coronary pneumonia76 redaciclovir holds the most potential for the treatment of 2019-ncov at present77 the results of animal experiments have demonstrated that compared with the control treatment redaciclovir effectively reduced viral titer in lung tissue of mers-cov-infected mice and improved lung tissue injury further its curative effects were superior to those of lopinavirritonavir combined with interferon- treatment after the first case of novel coronavirus was diagnosed in the united states after entering a critical state the symptoms of dyspnea were significantly improved after the use of redcevir and oxygen therapy was no longer required however research and development companies and physicians state that the effectiveness and safety of the drug have not been proven and further clinical research is needed the drug is currently in clinical trials78 in china anticoagulant therapy is recommended for secondary prevention of stroke in patients with acute cerebrovascular disease with an abnormal increase in d-dimer after treatment patients are admitted to the isolation ward of the infection department and concurrent rounds by neurologists in the isolation ward should occur daily to assist doctors with patient management covid-19 may cause respiratory diseases as well as other primary and secondary nervous system diseases at present neurological symptoms have been reported in covid-19 patients acute cerebrovascular symptoms such as sudden speech confusion and limb paralysis symptoms of intracranial infection such as headache epilepsy and disturbance of consciousness symptoms of muscle damage such as soreness and weakness of limbs and occasionally symptoms such as neuralgia abnormal sensation in this period of high incidence of covid-19 neurologists need to pay attention to this patient population especially patients with nervous system symptoms indeed differential diagnosis of covid-19 and early detection diagnosis treatment prevention and countermeasures are warranted  renin-angiotensin system blockers and the covid-19 pandemic ah danser jan murray epstein daniel batlle   in 2003 li et al4 demonstrated that ace2 is the receptor responsible for sars coronavirus entry binding to the ace2 receptor requires the surface unit of a viral spike protein s1 figure56 subsequent cell entry relies on priming by the serine protease tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 25 two recent reports confirmed that sars-cov-2 also enters the cell via this route78 importantly sars-cov-2 entry into the cell could be blocked both by s-protein neutralizing antibodies and tmprss2 inhibitors camostat mesylate7 in the lung ace2 expression occurs in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages generally however pulmonary ace2 expression is low when compared with other organs like the intestine testis heart and kidney911 ace2 displays considerable homology with ace angiotensin-converting enzyme 40 identity and 61 similarity and on this basis received its name in 200012 as a mono-carboxypeptidase it hydrolyzes multiple peptides including apelin opioids kinins and angiotensins much of the work on ace2 has centered on the biologic effects related to the formation of angiotensin-17 from angiotensin ii1314 unlike ace ace2 does not convert angiotensin i to angiotensin ii nor do ace inhibitors block its activity this is not surprising because the homology does not concern the active site ace2 is the most potent of the 3 enzymes known to convert the vasoconstrictor angiotensin ii to angiotensin-17915 angiotensin-17 is increasingly recognized to have organ-protective properties that oppose and counterbalance those of angiotensin ii within the ras the other known target peptide for ace2 cleavage is angiotensin i with the subsequent formation of angiotensin-19 figure ace2 is a membrane-bound enzyme and its soluble levels in blood are very low915 cleavage of its membrane-anchor shedding by adam17 a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 figure underlies its occurrence in body fluids angiotensin ii via its at1 angiotensin ii type 1 receptor upregulates adam17 thus increasing soluble ace2 levels16 in urine soluble ace2 levels can be significant and likely originate from shedding from the proximal tubular membrane in pathological states shedding of ace2 is often increased resulting in elevated soluble ace2 levels in blood urine and other body fluids1718 indeed a doubling of soluble ace2 has been reported in cerebrospinal fluid of hypertensive patients16 however given that by far the majority of ace2 is membrane-bound even a doubling is unlikely to significantly alter the amount of membrane-bound ace2 for instance if 2 of ace2 occurs in a soluble form doubling would increase this to 4 while still 96 of ace2 is membrane-bound theoretically ras blockade might partly reverse this thus returning the percent of membrane-bound ace2 to 9798 this is unlikely to seriously affect sars-cov-2 entry which depends on membrane-bound full-length ace2 this is really at the crux of the question and the prevailing confusion and panic that we are witnessing in the medical community after the word came out that ace2 is the receptor for sars-cov-2 part of the confusion in social media and the public in general stands because at times ace inhibitors are confused with ace2 inhibitors those are 2 different enzymes with 2 different active sites and any effect of ace inhibitors on ace2 activity must therefore be an indirect one via their respective substrates this is unlikely to have any relationship with sars-cov-2 binding there are however limited reports that ace inhibitors affect the expression of ace2 in the heart and the kidney19 at1 receptor blockers arbs alter ace2 expression more consistently in several studies both at the mrna and protein level1921 upregulation has been best documented in cardiac tissue and in the renal vasculature yet even here results are diverse required high doses and often differed per arb and per organ given the relationship with adam17 a clear distinction should be made between membrane-bound and soluble ace2 because an increase in soluble ace2 if anything might imply a decrease in membrane-bound ace2 because measuring membrane-bound ace2 in vivo is technically challenging most publications from humans have reported levels of ace2 activity in blood that reflect the soluble ace2 protein circulating at very low levels22 if arbs as a drug class would truly upregulate membrane-bound ace2 it is reasonable to first assume that this is because of at1 receptor blockade in agreement with this assumption angiotensin ii acutely induced ace2 internalization via its at1 receptor in ace2-transfected neuroblastoma cells23 ace inhibitors should then have the same directional effect as arbs although for these drugs there is very limited data showing upregulation of ace2 esler and esler24 suggested that the difference is due to the increased levels of angiotensin ii occurring after arb treatment but not ace inhibition high angiotensin ii levels would impose an increased substrate load on the enzyme thus requiring its upregulation here it should be stressed that the carboxypeptidase ace2 has multiple substrates and that an alteration in the level of one of these substrates angiotensin ii occurring at fmolml levels ie many orders of magnitude below the actual ace2 concentration cannot possibly make a meaningful difference in its substrate load taken together there is evidence from animal studies that arbs may upregulate membrane-bound ace2 whereas ace inhibitors may not the current data however are often conflicting and vary between arbs and tissue eg heart versus kidney even if the reported upregulation of tissue ace2 by arbs in animal studies and generally with high doses could be extrapolated to humans this would not establish that it is sufficient to facilitate sars-cov-2 entry we like to point out that a potentially beneficial pulmonary effect of arbs needs to be considered as well during acute lung injury alveolar ace2 appears to be downregulated2526 this would decrease angiotensin ii metabolism thus resulting in higher local levels of this peptide which increases alveolar permeability and fosters lung injury in this context one can speculate that having increased ace2 expression by preexisting arbs treatment may actually be protective in the course of sars-cov-2 infection it is not clear how hypertension was coded in the recent sars-cov-2 report1we can only speculate that it might be based on the use of hypertension medication rather than actual blood pressure measurement to truly address whether patients with hypertension are more likely to get serious and fatal sars-cov-2 infections a prospective cohort study with incidence rates of sars-cov-2 infection in a cohort of patients with hypertension and patients without hypertension is required with similar exposure history instead what has been reported is history of hypertension versus not in sars-cov-2 patients without any adjustment eg for age the use of ras blockers as a causal link is an assumption that lacks evidence as discussed here we therefore strongly recommend that patients who are taking ace inhibitors or arbs for high blood pressure heart failure or other medical indications should not withdraw their current treatment regimens unless they are specifically advised to do so by their physician or healthcare provider there is an additional caveat any resulting destabilizing of blood pressure control in hypertension which might possibly occur with medication changes would carry unacceptable risks of precipitating strokes and heart attacks risks which clearly are not just hypothetical simply discontinuing antihypertensive agents is strongly discouraged and should not be an option considering the widespread use of ras blockers throughout the world in particular asian people seem to be more prone to cough and therefore arbs may be preferable27 the available clinical database from the pandemic to date is insufficient to provide sufficient detail on the variables of interest hypertension diagnosis and the antihypertensive drugs prescribed to test the hypotheses proposed and provide certitude hence such information is desperately needed although no therapy is currently established for sars-cov-2 patients the field is moving rapidly with potential approaches being considered those include broad spectrum antivirals such as favipiravir and remdesivir28 tmprss2 inhibition with camostat mesylate7 and adam17 upregulation a more specific approach might be using soluble recombinant ace2 protein to intercept the virus from binding to the full-length ace2 anchored in the cell plasma membrane6 these approaches make the most sense for the treatment of patients with high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome for preventive purposes the goal of course is the development of a sars-cov-2 vaccine in closing we see no reason to abandon or discontinue temporarily the use of ras blockers preventatively in sars-cov-2 patients29 there are some concerns that these agents particularly arbs can affect the expression of ace2 based on animal models that however have not been challenged with coronavirus infection to evaluate the impact of ras blocker therapy since this information is lacking we see no rationale to panic and to alter the prescription of this critically important class of antihypertensives their therapeutic benefit in our opinion outweighs any potential risk of them predisposing to corona infection moreover it is unknown whether alternative antihypertensives do not carry the same risk another question is what to do in infected individuals with risk to progress to end-stage renal disease here the decision should be based on clinical judgment and considering the

cardiovascular disease and cardiac injury on in-hospital mortality in patients with covid-19 a systematic review and meta-analysis xintao li bo guan tong su wei liu mengyao chen khalid bin waleed xumin guan tse gary zhenyan zhu   in the past two decades the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 have taken severe death tolls worldwide with 916 and 800 deaths respectively1 in late 2019 another virus with lethal respiratory infection potential identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 emerged and heralded another global pandemic2 since the outbreak in wuhan more than 200 countries and regions have reported confirmed cases the who coined covid-19 to describe coronavirus disease 2019 and declared this outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern3 as of 24 april 2020 there have been nearly 2 750 000 infections and over 192 000 deaths worldwide within less than 6 months covid-19 has registered a mortality record that is higher than that of sars and mers combined4 5 because of the overwhelming fatality cases caused by covid-19 much concern has been raised to determine the risk factors for poor prognosis such as advanced age and male sex3 6 previous research has reported that patients with underlying cardiovascular disease cvd were prone to viral infection and also had a greater risk of developing severe cases and being admitted to intensive care unit7 8 sars-cov-2 can attack the respiratory system by targeting ace2 however with the high tissue-specificity of ace2 expression in the cardiovascular system cardiomyocytes may be particularly prone to damage9 several studies have reported a high incidence of elevated cardiac troponin in hospitalised patients especially in those in critical conditions10 11 thus patients with cvd complications may have poor prognosis when infected with sars-cov-2 therefore here we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the available evidence to evaluate the association between underlying cvd and incident cardiac injury with in-hospital mortality risk in patients with covid-19 a comprehensive search was performed in pubmed embase and web of science databases from 1 january 2020 to 14 april 2020 the following search terms were included coronavirus covid-19 2019-ncov sars-cov-2 cardiovascular disease coronary heart disease hypertension cardiac injury myocardia injury mortality death and fatality in addition the reference lists of relevant articles were reviewed for potential

exposure of interest duplicated publication not a primary study or medical intervention study online supplementary file 1 no additional studies met the inclusion criteria from screening reference lists when several studies were published by the same institution the authors were contacted to ensure that no overlapping cohorts were analysed as separate studies altogether 10 studies comprising 3118 patients were included in this meta-analysis1524
 the main characteristics of the included studies are summarised in table 1 of all 10 studies two were case series design15 16 and the remaining eight were cohort studies1724 all studies were conducted in wuhan china except for one study that enrolled patients nationwide17 the patients were all accrued from the end of december 2019 to february 2020 the mean age ranged from 49 years old17 to 6819 years old and the proportion of male patients ranged from 4522 to 6721 the prevalence of cvd and hypertension ranged from 417 to 1518 and from 1717 to 4419 respectively and from 1524 to 4415 of patients experienced cardiac injury during hospitalisation table 2 eight studies1517 19 2124 reported the relationship between underlying cvd and in-hospital mortality risk 2515 patients and 127 deaths in unadjusted model five studies1517 23 24 consistently revealed a significantly higher death risk in the cvd group and the remaining three studies19 21 22 reported no significant relationship between cvd and in-hospital mortality figure 2 overall the summary estimate demonstrated that patients with cvd had an approximately fivefold higher risk of mortality compared with non-cvd patients unadjusted or 485 p0001 95 ci 306 to 770 the heterogeneity across the studies was non-significant i2293 p0194 seven studies1517 2224 2463 patients and 535 deaths were included for the pre-existing hypertension and in-hospital mortality analysis with unadjusted ors six studies1517 2224 reported a significantly higher mortality risk in patients with previous hypertension and the remaining study19 showed no significant association figure 3 the pooled unadjusted effect of hypertension on mortality risk was 367 95 ci 231 to 583 p0001 with moderate heterogeneity i2574 p0029 for cardiac injury all eight studies15 16 1821 23 24 1429 patients and 374 deaths except one21 reported that acute cardiac injury was significantly associated with a high mortality risk in unadjusted model figure 4 the pooled effect of these studies unadjusted or 2115 95 ci 1019 to 4394 p0001 heterogeneity i2705 p0001 showed that patients with elevated troponin levels had a significant higher mortality risk than those with normal troponin levels visual inspection of the funnel plots did not show significant asymmetry online supplementary file 2 sensitivity analyses were conducted by systematically excluding one study at a time and the results remained consistent with the primary analyses online supplementary file 3 to explore potential sources of heterogeneity meta-regression was applied to test the influence of study design sample size mean age and male proportion none of these factors contributed significantly to the observed heterogeneity online supplementary file 4 our study evaluated the impact of underlying cvd hypertension and acute cardiac injury on in-hospital mortality in patients with covid-19 our results showed a positive association between previous cvd and hypertension with fatal outcomes with unadjusted ors and 95 cis of 485 306 to 770 and 367 231 to 583 and a significant relationship between acute cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality unadjusted or 2115 95 ci 1019 to 4394 the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov is a single-strand rna virus that shares several similarities with sars-cov and mers-cov in genetic sequencing and clinical presentation but is equipped with a more robust capacity for human-to-human transmission25 26 from the outset the capacity of 2019-ncov to spread and infect people in wuhan china was alarming and the infection has rippled throughout the rest of the world causing severe morbidity and mortality27 therefore there is a pressing need to identify risk factors for poor prognosis among patients with covid-19 patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were found to be more vulnerable to coronavirus infection and may have poor prognoses4 previous meta-analyses systematically tested the relationship between cvd and severity of the disease but with non-uniform definitions of clinical outcome28 29 the meta-analysis by zuin et al
30 included three studies and reported a positive association between hypertension and mortality risk in patients with covid-19 our study reinforced their conclusion and found that patients with cvd history also had an almost fivefold higher risk of mortality comparing with non-cvd patients however since our results were obtained using unadjusted ors the exact role of cvd in the risk stratification of patients with covid-19 is still undetermined there may be several mechanisms that account for the high mortality risk of covid-19 patients with cvd history first patients with underlying cvd are more likely to decline into an unstable haemodynamic status when infected with 2019-ncov31 severe pneumonia places a considerable workload on cardiac ventricles which may exacerbate pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction even causing cardiogenic shock4 second inflammatory reactions caused by 2019-ncov infection might convert chronic coronary artery disease into acute coronary syndrome32 33 a profound systemic inflammation wave along with local inflammatory infiltration may lead to a hypercoagulative state and atherosclerotic plaque rupture which may culminate in thrombotic events23 third the priority of treatments in favour of limiting nosocomial viral transmission while neglecting other medical issues might predispose cvd patients to unfavourable clinical outcomes the current interim guidelines suggest that patients with st-segment elevation myocardial infarction should consider thrombolysis first in the covid-19 era34 severe adverse effects such as cerebral haemorrhage and insufficient and undesignated coronary revascularisation caused by thrombolysis can increase the risk of death acute cardiac injury is commonly recorded in patients with covid-1935 the incidence of cardiac injury among our enrolled studies ranged from 15 to 44 which was higher than the prevalence of cvd 515 this suggested that 2019-ncov might attack cardiomyocytes through different pathways other than exacerbating the already compromised cardiovascular system 2019-ncov infection may lead to cardiac injury secondary to conditions causing oxygen supplement insufficiency such as severe pneumonia anaemia hypotension and bradycardia furthermore by attacking myocardium via the highly expressed ace2 directly 2019-ncov precipitated the release of cytokine and chemokine waves and caused myocardial inflammation even leading to fulminant myocarditis in severe cases31 36 meanwhile our results complied with guo et al18 who reported that the death risk of cardiac injury was much higher than that of pre-existing cvd their study revealed that patients with copresence of cvd and cardiac injury registered the highest mortality rate of 694 while those with only underlying cvd had a relatively favourable prognosis mortality rate of 133 furthermore elevated troponin was reported to be associated with a high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome hepatic dysfunction and acute renal injury in patients with covid-1918 37 the study by shi et al
20 demonstrated that elevated troponin was an independent risk factor for death after adjusting other confounders20 thus this index may be considered as a biomarker to predict the mortality risk of patients with covid-19 more studies are warranted to confirm this finding and provide probable suggestions on the risk stratification of patients with covid-19 to the best of our knowledge our study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association of underlying cvd and acute cardiac injury with mortality risk in patients with covid-19 this meta-analysis may provide insights into the prognosis stratification of patients with covid-19 however there are some important limitations that should be mentioned first our meta-analysis was conducted on unadjusted ors due to the limited data on multivariable-adjusted outcomes the observed association of cvd and cardiac injury with mortality might be confounded by other risk factors such as advanced age and cofounder adjustment may distort our meta-analysis results towards a less significant risk thus large cohort studies with multivariate analysis are needed to provide more evidence on this issue second our study could not determine the causal effects of cardiovascular comorbidities on mortality due to the inherent limitations of observational studies future studies aiming to investigate this causal association are warranted third the heterogeneity among studies for cardiac injury was significantly high which may be caused by the study design and patient inclusion criteria however the meta-regression exploring the potential sources did not find significant results and the results remained consistent in sensitivity analyses finally most of the studies enrolled were conducted in wuhan china therefore these results should be treated with caution when extrapolated to other populations since wuhan was the initial epicentre of the outbreak these early evidence may provide clinical implications and insights for researchers and clinicians in other parts of the world covid-19 patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities including cvd and hypertension may face a greater risk of fatal outcomes acute cardiac injury may act as a marker of in-hospital mortality risk given the unadjusted results of our meta-analysis future well-designed studies with multivariate analysis are warranted to confirm these findings  clinical considerations for patients with diabetes in times of covid-19 epidemic akhtar hussain nayla cristina do vale moreira   dear sir as of todays reports the global number of confirmed cases of covid-19 has surpassed 150000 the number of known cases is increasing by several thousand every day on march 11 2020 who publicly characterized covid-19 as a pandemic the issue is of serious concern and deserves momentous attention coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses most of them cause illness in animals but seven known types of coronaviruses cause illness in humans the coronavirus sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 is one of those viruses  it causes the illness currently known as coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 though we are still learning what exactly puts someone at greater risk of developing a severe illness with covid-19 early information indicates older patients and those with chronic medical conditions such as hypertension diabetes and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases may be at higher risk 1 2 3 infection caused by covid-19 is likely to disturb metabolic regulation diabetic patients with covid-19 may face an altered immune response on the background of an already compromised health status owing to the diabetes-related complications andor aging the most important findings in patients with hyperglycemia and a viral infection were significant worsening of symptoms which implies greater morbidity in these patients when compared to those without diabetes 3 however the pathophysiology of this association remains uncertain it is not known whether hyperglycemia changes the virulence of the infection or if the virus modifies the glycemic metabolism what we know is that diabetic patients are more susceptible to infection and this can impact on glucose metabolism 4 dm is not just a disorder of glucose metabolism but a chronic

19 increased expression of ace2 could theoretically increase the risk of infection with sars cov-2 this could be a concern in people with diabetes who are at already elevated risk of infections because of many other factors however currently there is no evidence to support this hypothesis in view of lack of robust evidence for either benefit or harm it is reasonable for patients to continue using ace inhibitors and arb as recommended by european society of cardiology council on hypertension and european society of hypertension20

  clinical considerations for patients with diabetes in times of covid-19 pandemic akhtar hussain nayla do vale moreira cristina   dear sir as of todays reports the global number of confirmed cases of covid-19 has surpassed 150000 the number of known cases is increasing by several thousand every day on march 11 2020 who publicly characterized covid-19 as a pandemic the issue is of serious concern and deserves momentous attention coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses most of them cause illness in animals but seven known types of coronaviruses cause illness in humans the coronavirus sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 is one of those viruses  it causes the illness currently known as coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 though we are still learning what exactly puts someone at greater risk of developing a severe illness with covid-19 early information indicates older patients and those with chronic medical conditions such as hypertension diabetes and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases may be at higher risk 1 2 3 infection caused by covid-19 is likely to disturb metabolic regulation diabetic patients with covid-19 may face an altered immune response on the background of an already compromised health status owing to the diabetes-related complications andor aging the most important findings in patients with hyperglycemia and a viral infection were significant worsening of symptoms which implies greater morbidity in these patients when compared to those without diabetes 3 however the pathophysiology of this association remains uncertain it is not known whether hyperglycemia changes the virulence of the infection or if the virus modifies the glycemic metabolism what we know is that diabetic patients are more susceptible to infection and this can impact on glucose metabolism 4 dm is not just a disorder of glucose metabolism but a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by multiple changes in lipid carbohydrate and protein profiles 5 such inflammatory processes are due to hyperglycemia which leads to increased synthesis of glycosylation end products ages activates macrophages and other cells of

  the lung the heart the novel coronavirus and the renin-angiotensin system the need for clinical trials eugenie lumbers r sarah delforce j kirsty pringle g gary smith r   this article explains how the renin-angiotensin system ras interacts with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and also with the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 which causes infection and subsequent acute lung and probably heart injury covid-19 13 as well as identifying potential therapeutic strategies for treating acute lung injury and myocarditis in covid-19 see also 46 this article provides a background to the management of patients with essential hypertension in accordance with recommendations made in the joint statement issued by the heart failure society of america the american college of cardiology and the american heart association 7 that patients who are using drugs that block the ras should continue to use them during this pandemic it also describes why the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceis and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs is associated with less severe covid-19 infections 8 9 there are two major arms of the ras one arm the angiotensin ii ang ii-ang ii type 1 receptor at1r pathway is pro-inflammatory and can cause acute lung injury 10 11 the other arm the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2-ang1-7-mas receptor masr pathway is anti-inflammatory because ace2 metabolizes ang ii thus reducing its levels and converting it to the anti-inflammatory peptide ang1-7 figure 1a 2 12 ace2 is the receptor for coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 4 as a result of sars-cov-2 binding to ace2 the enzyme is no longer functional 13 thus the pro-inflammatory ang ii-at1r is no longer blocked by the ace2-ang1-7-masr pathway and it is this imbalance that causes acute lung injury 13 a multi-centered double blind clinical trial has recently been established to test the efficacy of treating patients suffering from covid-19 with an arb httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04312009 a second is investigating the outcomes of treatment of covid-19 patients with aceis or arbs httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04331574 coronaviruses are a group of viruses that have in recent years caused epidemics of acute respiratory syndromes the first major epidemic was sars severe acute respiratory syndrome-cov in 2003 which was responsible for 8000 deaths the second was mers middle east respiratory syndrome which occurred in 2012 the most recent is sars-cov-2 which causes covid-19 it was first recognized in china in december 2019 and is now sweeping the world sars-cov-2 is already responsible for more cases of infection and also more deaths than the two previous coronavirus epidemics there are also a number of other coronaviruses that cause upper respiratory tract infections in particular hcov-nl63 sars-cov and sars-cov-2 both enter the cell by binding to ace2 13 14 as does hcov-nl63 15 hcov-nl63 like sars-cov-2 can cause mild respiratory infections but most commonly affects the young 16 it has however been associated with bronchiolitis and croup but does not cause the acute respiratory distress syndrome ards characteristic of sars-cov-2 infection the differences in the severity of illness caused by these two viruses could be related to a differing affinity of the viruses to ace2 17 or the fact that entry of hcov-nl63 into cells requires intracellular acidification while sars-cov entry can occur independent of intracellular acidification 18 mers-cov binds to a different receptor dipeptidyldipeptidase4 dpp4 19 and another human coronavirus hcov-229e uses aminopeptidase n apn as its receptor 20 these receptors are membrane-bound proteases and all can affect the production or metabolism of angiotensin peptides 21 22 zhang et al in a clinical study of 140 patients found that hypertension and diabetes were the two most common comorbidities in patients with covid-19 23 the increase in the prevalence of these two comorbidities in patients with severe disease was not significant when compared with those with infections that were not severe 23 in a study by guan et al 261 patients 237 had a co-existing disorder and 215 of them reached the composite end-point admission to icu use of mechanical ventilation or death 24 of the 15 that had hypertension and 74 that had diabetes 131 and 61 respectively of these patients reached the composite end-point it should be noted that hypertension and diabetes are very common comorbidities no other co-existing disorders were as prevalent in this cohort there has been considerable debate about the use of drugs that block the ras in the treatment of hypertensive patients who have covid-19 25 this debate has not adequately considered the roles of local pulmonary and circulating rass in the pathogenesis of covid-19 put simply ace2 the receptor for entry of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 also activates a ras pathway that prevents acute lung injury 1 2 these ying and yang actions of ace2 have caused an apparent dilemma concerning the use of ras blocking drugs in the treatment of hypertension and diabetes this is because while they upregulate the sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 a means for viral entry into cells they also protect tissues from the pro-inflammatory actions of ang ii and could be an effective therapeutic strategy to manage covid-19 induced lung injury see also 4 5 this seems to be the case in the light of recent clinical studies 8 9 figure 1a shows the major arms of the ras that are involved in the pathogenesis of coronavirus-induced acute lung injury we have avoided including a number of other ras pathways involved in the metabolism of ang ii for simplicity a more thorough description of these pathways can be obtained elsewhere 12 as seen in figure 1b there are two major pathways involved in the pathogenesis of coronavirus-induced infections both pathways involve the formation of ang ii from ang i a peptide produced by the action of renin on angiotensinogen the octapeptide ang ii is formed by the action of angiotensin converting enzyme ace on ang i ang ii can bind to two receptors the at1r and the at2r or it can be broken down by number of proteases to smaller peptides that have a variety of biological actions the most important pathway for ang ii break down is via the removal of one amino acid from its c-terminus by a zinc-dependent carboxy peptidase ace2 to generate the peptide ang1-7 which acts on another receptor known as the masr there are other pathways that can also generate ang1-7 12 these two ras pathways ang ii-at1r and ace2-ang1-7-masr have opposing actions in addition ang ii can act via the at2r to produce effects similar to those generated by the ace2-ang 1-7-masr pathway 12 the ang ii-at1r axis is well-known because it is responsible for hypertension it raises blood pressure both through actions in the brain on the sympathetic nervous system and in peripheral blood vessels causing vasoconstriction this axis also controls sodium reabsorption partly through its own actions in the kidney but also because it stimulates the release of the sodium retaining hormone aldosterone from the adrenal gland there are other actions of this pathway that are pro-inflammatory and which stimulate fibrosis the ace2-ang1-7-masr pathway on the other hand lowers blood pressure possibly through production of nitric oxide furthermore the ace2-ang1-7-masr pathway is anti-inflammatory thus ace2 not only breaks down ang ii but also produces a vasodilator anti-inflammatory molecule ang1-7 26 the circulating ras is an endocrine system capable of reaching the brain the heart and the lungs but there are also local tissue rass in many organs such as the heart the kidney the female reproductive tract and the brain there is also a local lung ras 27 that has been implicated in the etiology of pulmonary fibrosis 11 28 through a combination of circulating and tissue systems the ras can have powerful effects in the lungs renin is released from the kidneys into venous blood and renal lymphatics it produces ang i from angiotensinogen which is produced by the liver ang i in the venous blood returning to the heart and lungs is converted in the lung by ace to ang ii thus the lung is exposed to high levels of ang ii the gene for ace2 is located on xp22 and contains 18 exons many of which are similar to the ace gene it is a zn carboxypeptidase with only one catalytic site and it has 40 homology with ace it is an ectoenzyme with its n-terminus and catalytic site facing the extracellular space so it can metabolize circulating peptides 29 ace inhibitors aceis do not affect its activity the spike s protein on the surface of the sars-cov-2 covid-19 mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion the spike protein is trimeric and on fusion separates into s1 and s2 subunits s1 contains the receptor binding domain that directly binds to the catalytic site of ace2 when this occurs a cleavage site on the s2 protein develops which is acted on by host proteases resulting in membrane fusion 14 the s protein of sars-cov-2 binds to the catalytic site of ace2 more efficiently than does the sars-cov 30 unfortunately antibodies that recognize the sars-cov receptor binding domain rbd do not recognize the sars-cov-2 rbd 30 however sera from convalescent sars patients cross neutralized the sars-spike protein s-driven entry into cells 31 and polyclonal murine antibodies directed against the sars-cov spike protein s potently inhibit sars-cov-2 s cell entry 32 there is a widespread distribution of ace2 throughout the body 33 including the lungs 11 heart 34 35 and kidney 36 coronaviruses gain access to the body via the respiratory tract and it has recently been shown that nasal goblet cells type ii pneumocytes and ileal enterocytes all possess the necessary combination of ace2 and tmprss2 for viral entry to be successful 31 37 hcov-nl63 binds to human airway epithelial cells in vitro 38 in the lung ace2 is widely distributed throughout the bronchial and pulmonary epithelium and the pulmonary capillaries 39 ace2 protects the lung from the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic actions of circulating ang ii by metabolizing ang ii to ang1-7 which acting via the masr inhibits ang ii-at1r pro-inflammatory pathways figure 1a 4 ace2 levels vary with age being highest in young animals and lowest in older animals levels in older males and females being 78 and 67 lower respectively 40 this suggests that young people are more likely to get the sars coronavirus infection than older people as appears to be the case on the other hand decreased production of ace2 in the elderly could be one reason why coronaviruses cause more serious complications in older persons it has to be said however that there has not been a systematic study of the relationships between age and ace2 expression in human tissues and as explained below there may be species specific differences in the lungs 1 2 the heart 35 41 and the kidney ace2 36 protects against the pro-inflammatory actions of ang ii acting via the at1r figure 1b shows two sites of action of drugs that block the activity of the ras mediated by the interaction of ang ii with the at1r one of the two classes of drugs commonly used in clinical practice blocks the activity of the ras by blocking the formation of ang ii it inhibits the activity of ace ace is a zn containing carboxypeptidase that removes a dipeptide from the c-terminal end of the decapeptide ang i thus generating the active peptide responsible for most actions of the ras ang ii drugs that block this enzyme are known as ace inhibitors aceis they have no direct effect on the activity of ace2 except by limiting the amount of ang ii that is produced the second group of drugs are known as angiotensin receptor blockers arbs they block the interaction of ang ii with the at1r arbs do not reduce ang ii levels the use of these drugs could result in two significant consequences lung ace2 is the receptor for both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 13 31 the spike s protein binds to ace2 and enters the cell where it is modified by a serine protease tmprss2 this protease is essential for cell entry of the virus 31 the binding of coronaviruses to ace2 and the modification of its spike protein by tmprss2 are essential for infection binding of the sars-cov spike protein to ace2 results in reduced ace2 protein levels 13 kuba et al 13 showed that ace2-- knockout mice did not get infected with sars-cov and did not get acute lung inflammation 13 thus it would appear that low levels of pulmonary ace2 protect against coronavirus infection there is however a sinister side effect to the loss of pulmonary ace2 because it plays a critical role in preventing acute lung injury xie et al suggest that there is a greater prevalence of sars-cov in young people because they have higher ace2 levels 40 yet there is a paradox because if young people like other mammals have high levels of pulmonary ace2 they should be more susceptible to symptomatic infection with coronaviruses the prevalence of infection is however based on the appearance of symptoms and in the young the disease is usually so mild that infection rates appear to be low in fact the milder nature of the disease in the young compared to the old could be a consequence of the age-dependent nature of ace2 expression in the lung see above on the other hand it is possible that the animal data on ace2 expression and age is misleading as some human studies have shown that the older the patient the higher the level of circulating ace2 43 44 as stated above there is no systematic study exploring the effects of age on ace2 expression by human tissues the differences between animal-based studies and human data may well be related to the short life span of animals used and the fact that they are housed in environments that protect them from infections and pollution etc it has also been claimed that arbs stimulate the expression of ace2 in the lung and that this accounts for a higher morbidity in hypertensive patients suffering from covid-19 25 as stated above there is no evidence that arbs have this effect on pulmonary ace2 but arbs upregulate cardiac ace2 ang ii levels are likely to be elevated in patients treated with an arb as ang ii is the major substrate from which ace2 produces ang1-7 1 it might be expected that high levels of ang ii would upregulate ace2 however ang ii and ang1-7 have counter regulatory actions on ace2 expression via map kinasephosphatase pathways 45 furthermore ang ii downregulates ace2 activity in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts 42 therefore the overall effects of arbs on pulmonary ace2 could be modified by counteracting the effects of ang1-7 hypertension and diabetes are the most common comorbidities found in patients suffering from covid-19 in one study there was no significant difference in the existence of either comorbidity between less severe and more severe cases 23 however in a study comparing 113 patients who died with covid-19 infections hypertension and cardiovascular disease were more common than in patients who recovered 161 furthermore acute cardiac injury and heart failure like acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure contributed to the critical nature of the illness 46 ace2 protects the lung from acute lung injury because it reduces levels of ang ii by converting it to ang1-7 in 2005 imai et al 1 showed that ace2 played a critical role in the prevention of lung injury briefly they induced acute lung injury in mice by sepsis lipopolysaccharide lps endotoxin or by acid aspiration these treatments all caused severe lung inflammation in ace2-- knockout mice which was mitigated by intraperitoneal injections of recombinant human ace2 1 in a second publication in 2005 kuba et al 13 not only showed that ace2 was the definitive receptor for sars-cov but that loss of ace2 from the lung caused by the binding of viral spike protein was responsible for the acute lung injury caused by coronavirus infections they also showed as would be expected from the known actions of ace2 that this viral infection was associated with raised ang ii levels which caused acute lung injury via the ang ii-at1r pathway treatment with the arb losartan prevented sars-cov-induced lung injury 13 we suggest that pulmonary ace2 plays a critical role in protecting the lung from ang ii-at1r induced inflammation because not only is there a local pulmonary ras but the lung is also the major site for conversion of ang i which is inactive to ang ii 47 therefore loss of ace2 by binding of sars-cov-2 not only exposes the pulmonary epithelium to locally formed ang ii but also to ang ii formed in the lung from circulating ang i recently a sars-cov-2 infected patient presented with acute heart failure a week after experiencing flu-like symptoms and was diagnosed with acute myocarditis without any interstitial pneumonitis 48 it is known that sars binds to myocardial ace2 and downregulates myocardial ace2 protein 3 the protective effects of ace2 in the heart are well-described 41 49 and it is the major metabolic pathway for breakdown of ang ii in the heart 50 ace2 protects the heart from ang ii-at1r signaling induced injury 34 to summarize the data described above demonstrate that there could be a problem in treating coronavirus infections while it is most advisable to prevent viral infection and reduce the viral load prevention of coronavirus-associated lung and cardiac injury saves lives the dual role of ace2 as a receptor for the virus in the lungs and heart but a protector of the lungs and heart from coronavirus-induced injury has led to debate concerning the use of anti-hypertensive drugs that inhibit the ras because they upregulate ace2 in the lung increase receptor availability and therefore may increase viral load there is no doubt however that ang ii-acting via the at1r causes acute lung injury and probably cardiac injury when the ace2-ang1-7-mas receptor pathway is blocked by downregulation of ace2 this pathway also protects from other forms of acute lung injury as well as sars-cov induced injury arbs would prevent downregulation of this pathway once infection has occurred and ameliorate any unopposed pro-inflammatory effects of ang ii mediated via its at1r aceis on the other hand may not upregulate ace2 but would prevent ang ii-induced inhibition of ace2 activity since there is an approved serine protease inhibitor that could be used to block tmprss2 it is possible that this could be used to treat covid-19 another potential alternative could be to saturate the airways with recombinant ace2 or soluble ace2 so that viral particles are mopped up leaving bronchial pulmonary ace2 intact treatment with recombinant human ace2 could have the added beneficial effect of protecting the lung against lung injury the major problem facing treatment of coronavirus-induced lung and probably cardiac injury is that there is reduced ace2 caused by the virus binding to ace2 this means that ang ii is no longer metabolized by ace2 and the anti-inflammatory ang1-7 pathway is lost thus lung and cardiac ang ii-at1r pro-inflammatory pathways are activated and unopposed by the protective arm of the ras as suggested by kuba et al 13 arbs are an appropriate adjunct therapy for treating coronavirus-induced lung injury recent analysis of clinical data from patients with covid-19 support the use of ras blocking drugs in the treatment of this infection 8 9 other alternatives as suggested by imai et al include injection of recombinant ace2 haschke et al 51 have shown the rhace2 is well-tolerated by healthy human subjects the publication of the first clinical trials to test the efficacy of arbs and aceis in the treatment of acute lung injury induced by sars-cov-2 is welcome news because these drugs are widely used clinically if the results of these trials support the clinical data already obtained and improve the outcome of coronavirus infections they would be of immeasurable benefit in the clinical management of this pandemic el wrote the first draft of the manuscript all authors contributed to manuscript revision read and approved the submitted version

covid-19 an update on the associated comorbidities and proposed therapies fernanda costa farias wilian rosrio reis ana ribeiro farias cludia ramon de souza guimares roberta duarte gondim sabrine wermerson barroso assuno   named by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the novel coronavirus with origin associated with the city of wuhan hubei province china spread rapidly worldwide causing thousands of deaths characterizing the infection as a public health problem of global interest 12 with a high infectivity rate the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 reached pandemic proportions 3 according to the report published by world health organization who on june 1st the number of confirmed cases reaches 6057853 distributed in 216 countries with emphasis on the european and american continents with more than two million cases each together adding up around 82 of infected global number covid-19 has already killed more than 371166 people worldwide especially among elderly patients and individuals with comorbidities currently the united states us has already more than 1734040 confirmed cases but despite its large number of infected people it is countries like spain 29045 deaths italy 33415 deaths and the united kingdom 38489 deaths which presented the highest mortality rate exceeding 10 4 the disease evolution and the symptoms vary from asymptomatic patients to severe cases of respiratory failure which can lead to death 5 some risk factors may be associated with the evolution and disease severity in a study conducted in the us during march 2020 with 1482 patients hospitalized with covid-19 in fourteen states 12 of the total were history of comorbidities of this total 497 were hypertensive 483 were obese patients with chronic liver diseases totaled 346 diabetics represented 283 and people with cardiovascular diseases were 278 6 in another study conducted in wuhan city china 191 patients with covid-19 were followed up of which 48 had comorbidities such as hypertension 30 diabetes 19 and coronary disease 8 7 until june 1st 2020 brazil had 347398 confirmed cases of covid-19 with 13868 deaths associated with comorbidities heart disease was the most common comorbidity with total of 7318 deaths followed by diabetes kidney disease neurological disease pneumopathy obesity immunosuppression and asthma with a total of 5627 1218 1159 1061 742 740 and 397 deaths respectively 8 in this context metabolic syndrome ms is inserted as a common denominator to these comorbidities since it is defined as a set of metabolic disorders that include insulin resistance dyslipidemia central obesity and hypertension which are risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases 910 in 2017 it was estimated that ms affected 20 of north american population 25 of european population and approximately 15 of chinese population 1112 in this scenario the relationship between ms and its comorbidities that aggravate the covid-19 prognosis cannot be ignored also its presence in different ethnicities and continents places sm as an important risk factor for covid-19 thus this review is aimed at providing overview of metabolic changes associated with ms and its relationship with development and worsening of sars-cov-2 infection as well as to review the proposed drugs for the treatment of these patients we collated and discussed the available evidences that have emerged so far on the presence of obesity diabetes cardiovascular and liver disease in the patients with covid-19 and proposed therapies we systematically searched the pubmed and google scholar databases until june 1st 2020 using the keywords covid-19 metabolic syndrome and following terms obesity diabetes liver nafld hypertension cardiovascular disease chloroquine hydroxychloroquine antiretroviral drugs and treatment of coronavirus we also accessed the full text of the relevant cross references from the search results the who points obesity as a global epidemic estimating that in 2016 more than 650 million people over aged 18 years were obese worldwide 12 since obesity is a risk factor for several diseases including infectious ones these data become even more alarming 13 the bodies of obese patients are in constant chronic inflammation due to the high concentrations of chemokines adipokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines this chronic inflammation causes a delayed and inferior immune response with decreased activation of macrophages in infection course in addition the immune memory of obese individuals is also impaired both humoral and cellular weakening both adaptive response of immune system to disease and immunization of these patients 13 14 15 obesity had previously been identified as a risk factor for viral infections due to its influence on immune response 15 during the 2009 h1n1 outbreak obese patients had more stringent complications and care needs 14 in relation to covid-19 research points to the high rate of obese patients with complications and need for hospitalization 16 a study carried out in new york city nyc us showed that among the 3615 patients who tested positive for covid-19 21 had obesity and 16 of total had a body mass index bmi  35 kgm2 severe obesity being much more likely to develop the most severe forms of the disease these patients had a greater need for hospitalization and care in the intensive care unit icu 17 in another study also in nyc that followed 4103 patients with covid-19 of which 1999 489 were hospitalized it was observed that individuals with bmi  40 kgm2 were six times more likely to be hospitalized 18 in a retrospective study of 112 patients with covid-19 conducted at a hospital in wuhan city the bmi of patients in critical group bmi  25 kgm2 was significantly higher than the non-critical group and of 17 patients who died 15 882 had a bmi  25 kgm2 19 in view of alarming number of cases in countries like the us where it is estimated that around 36 of population is obese 20 and in europe where according to the most recent who estimates obesity affects 1030 of the population 21 obesity represents a serious problem when related to covid-19 these data reflect the current alarming situation faced by european countries such as those already mentioned the united kingdom italy spain and also the us and brazil whose number of serious cases and deaths tops the global statistics pointing to obesity as risk factor for covid-19 mortality 4 in 2016 diabetes was seventh most deadly disease worldwide with approximately 16 million deaths directly 22 it represents a risk factor for the development of other pathologies standing out as a disease of great medical interest 23 its relationship with infectious diseases is not yet fully understood however in addition to suppressing the patients immunity it can cause metabolic dysfunction that directly affects homeostasis of the entire organism 24 in a study about relationship between diabetes morbidity and mortality rate among patients with sars-cov it was observed that patients with a known history of diabetes who died were 215 versus 39 of diabetic survivors 25 diabetes patients have been reported to have up to four times more chance of hospitalization during the h1n1 pandemic 26 like sars-cov and h1n1 diabetes appears as a comorbidity with potential to aggravate and lead to death by the sars-cov-2 infection in a meta-analysis that included more than 40000 infected people from wuhan hubei province china 8 of these were diabetic patients 27 in another study conducted in wuhan 191 patients were followed up and 54 died among non-survivors 31 were diabetic 28 the death rate reported by the chinese center for disease control for more than 70000 cases was 23 but this was increased to 73 when analyzed diabetics patients in the same group 29 diabetes has been identified as the second most common comorbidity among cases of covid-19 hypotheses have been raised that this high incidence rate in diabetic patients is directly linked to high gene expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 in their cells which are used by sars-cov-2 to enter human cells due to treatment with ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii type-i receptor blockers arbs 30 this would not only increase the risk of these patients to infection but would also make it difficult to control comorbidity during treatment against covid-19 this relationship is not yet fully understood and further studies are needed to confirm it since the drug treatment protocols for diabetic patients remain the same for their metabolic dysfunction 31 hypertension has appeared in research in various countries and continents as the most common comorbidity among those infected with sars-cov-2 5 6 7272830 as well as cardiovascular diseases cvd that appear as risk factors for severe complications of covid-19 arterial hypertension heart failure and arrhythmia are some of diseases of the cardiovascular system that can generate several complications in sars-cov-2 infection course 32 in an analysis of 99 patients with covid-19 it was observed that 21 of patients had problems such as hypertension or coronary heart disease and of the 32 patients who developed severe forms of pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 17 individuals had some heart disease 33 a meta-analysis involving more than 3000 patients with covid-19 found that patients with cvd are up to five times more likely to develop the disease critical stage 34 data from the chinese center for disease control and prevention pointed a 23 mortality rate in a group of 44672 infected with covid-19 however this number was much higher among patients with hypertension and cvd reaching 6 and 105 respectively 32 in addition to history of cvd being an aggravating factor in covid-19 development cardiovascular complications can also be result of the infection acute myocardial injury has been observed in 8 of confirmed cases of disease with an elevation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i found in up to 12 of cases while the troponin among patients with mild symptoms of infection was found in low concentration 3235 in the investigation 187 patients with covid-19 were evaluated of the 36 patients who had a history of cvd and died 25 had high troponin levels 35 the high concentration of ace2 in cardiac tissue can be pointed out as possible mechanism for the lesions since this enzyme is used by sars-cov-2 to invade the cell making the heart a favorable site for viral colonization as in diabetes many of drugs used to treat hypertension act as ace inhibitors and arbs increasing ace2 expression in the individual 303236 as a highly active tissue with a high demand for energy produced by mitochondria hypoxia promoted by covid-19 can cause damage in the myocardium and have severe consequences for the infected patient 3235 currently cvd are the main cause of death being responsible for 31 of deaths in 2016 much of this is reflection of eating habits and sedentary lifestyle that modern life has provided for the population ms is a contributing factor to the development of cvd and in the current pandemic scenario this sedentary lifestyle takes its toll 37 the liver is an important organ for the most diverse body metabolic functions damage caused to hepatic tissue by covid-19 has been observed in addition pathologies that affect it are inserted as risk factors for complications and severe manifestations of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus 38 like other organs liver cells especially bile duct cells have ace2 enzyme on their surface placing liver tissue as a possible infection site for the virus 39 previously during the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses sars-cov outbreak studies have shown direct action of virus on hepatocytes causing apoptosis in cells and inducing injury elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have also been found in patients with liver damage like the 2012 epidemic by middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus mers-cov liver damage caused by infection was observed in infected patients however unlike sars-cov and sars-cov-2 mers-cov uses another receptor to invade the cell dipeptidyl-peptidase iv dpp-4 which is widely expressed in hepatocytes as with sars-cov infection high serum levels of inflammatory cytokines have been described in these patients 4041 in the current pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus some studies have already observed abnormal concentrations of liver function markers in the study with 202 patients it was observed that patients with nafld had a higher risk of covid-19 progression and of the 39 patients with progressive condition 34 87 had nafld inflammation of liver tissue resulting from pro-inflammatory cytokines released by adipose tissue becomes even more aggravated by the pathogen presence such as sars-cov-2 with complications not fully clarified but potentially severe for infected patient 42 it was observed that approximately 2030 of patients with covid-19 had elevated transaminases especially in those with metabolic disorders associated with obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease nafld 4243 it is not yet clear whether liver damage is primary caused directly by the virus and inflammatory reaction or secondary caused by drugs used in treatment and hypoxia caused by pneumonia however even if modest the changes exist and certainly the history of pre-existing liver disease tends to worsen the infection prognosis 4144 in this context nafld which is considered the hepatic manifestation of ms characterized by the deposit of fat in liver tissue is inserted as a comorbidity subject to detailed observation 45 its prevalence is estimated between 20 and 30 in the population of western countries and between 5 and 18 among asian countries being significantly increased in obese and diabetic patients 46 researches on the relationship between nafld and covid-19 are still scarce in the absence of any known effective therapy and due to the pandemic situation recently many drugs in the treatment of covid-19 have been tested drugs previously proposed for the treatment of viral diseases including previous outbreaks by other coronavirus sars-cov and mers-cov began to be tested with emphasis on chloroquine and its hydroxychloroquine analog associated or not with azithromycin corticosteroids and other antiviral medications in patients with covid-19 4748 the proposed pharmacological treatments are summarized in table 1
 which shows the mechanism of action and adverse effects of drugs experimental studies have suggested that chloroquine cq is a proven antimalarial drug that can inhibit the replication of various intracellular microorganisms including coronavirus in vitro 4950 it is suggested a possible inhibition of sars-cov-2 replication by terminal glycosylation of ace2 produced by pulmonary vessels inhibiting the link between virus and receptor inhibition of viral infection by raising the endosomal ph is also reported thus interfering with virus-cell fusion in addition it was observed that this medicine contributed to prevention of viral spread in cell cultures 47 hydroxychloroquine hcq can also increase intracellular ph and inhibit lysosomal activity in antigen-presenting cells this process reduces t cell activation differentiation and expression of costimulatory proteins and production of cytokines in the cytoplasm it interferes with synthesis of viral nucleic acids attenuating pro-inflammatory response both mechanisms strengthen the hypothesis that hcq can suppress sars-cov-2 by inhibiting the hyperactivation of immune system triggered by the virus and thus reducing disease progression from mild to severe however still without clinical evidence 4950 although hcq and cq have shown antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in vitro hcq appears to have a more potent action furthermore hcq has a clinical safety superior to cq with its long-term use as it allows the use of higher doses and has few interactions with other drugs 51 a non-randomized controlled trial showed that azithromycin associated with hcq was significantly more efficient to eliminate virus where 70 of patients had no detectable viral load after 6 days of treatment however these drugs must be used carefully the azithromycin indiscriminate use being an antimicrobial can cause bacterial resistance the use of cq may cause an increase of qt interval retinopathy and cardiovascular disorders which should certainly be of concern in hypertensive patients 52 the research warns to the adverse effects and real effectiveness of medications according to studies widespread use of hcq will expose patients to fatal consequences including skin reactions liver failure and ventricular arrhythmia especially if prescribed in association with azithromycin furthermore there is a risk that cq phosphate can cause acute poisoning or even death 53 54 55 56 researchers analyzed 1376 patients with covid-19 in new york city where 589 811 were treated with hcq of the treated total 346 developed respiratory failure 180 were intubated and 166 died without intubation according to the analysis patients who took hcq were more likely to develop respiratory failure than those who did not use it 54 this makes randomized controlled trials with hcq extremely necessary in patients with covid-19 mainly associated with metabolic disorders patients who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes andor hypertension who are treated with ace inhibitors andor arbs have a considerable increase in eca2 receptors expression which may facilitate the virus entry the same authors report that patients using these drugs can develop severe and fatal covid-19 56 as an appropriate alternative treatment the use of calcium channel blockers as antihypertensive agents is suggested a patient-centered approach should be used to guide the choice of pharmacological agents considering age severity of covid-19 cardiovascular comorbidities and risk of hypoglycemia 5657 another possibly promising drug is favipiravir a drug with proven action against ebola virus the drugs efficiency in reducing sars-cov-2 infection is due to the inhibition of rna polymerase activity 5859 a randomized clinical trial with 240 patients in china showed that favipiravir 7143 is more effective than arbidol 5586 in the treatment of covid-19 patients with hypertension andor diabetes who used favipiravir experienced a reduction in fever and cough relief faster than patients who used arbidol however there was no difference in auxiliary oxygen therapy or non-invasive mechanical ventilation between patients 60 antiretroviral drugs lopinavirritonavir an oral combination agent approved by the us food and drug administration fda for the treatment of hiv demonstrated in vitro activity against other coronaviruses by inhibiting 3-chymotrypsin-like protease 61 adverse effects of lopinavirritonavir include gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea and diarrhea up to 28 and hepatotoxicity 210 62 in patients with covid-19 these adverse effects may be exacerbated by combination therapy or due to viral infection 43 remdesivir gs-5734 as adenosine nucleoside analogue prodrug has a broad-antiviral spectrum against phyloviruses paramyxoviruses pneumoviruses and coronaviruses 63 in vitro studies have shown the ability of remdesivir to inhibit coronaviruses replication in primary human lung cells 6364 patients hospitalized with severe covid-19 treated with compassionate-use remdesivir showed clinical improvement in 36 of 53 patients 68 65 well as showed shortened time to recovery and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection in the remdesivir group 66 however in another study remdesivir in adults with severe covid-19 was not associated with significant clinical benefits but the patients who received remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo with symptom duration of 10 days or less 67 in all studies adverse events were reported during follow-up of patients between 28 and 66 such as anemia or decreased hemoglobin thrombocytopenia acute kidney injury decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate increased blood creatinine increased total bilirubin hyperglycemia and increased aminotransferase levels which suggests clinical investigation in patients with complications associated with metabolic syndrome 65 66 67 another potential adjuvant therapy for covid-19 is the use of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulins 68 the justification for this treatment is that the antibodies of recovered patients can help in the immune response against the virus in individuals with covid-19 or be a preventive measure of infection in cases of vulnerable individuals with diverse metabolic disorders nitazoxanide traditionally an anthelmintic agent has broad antiviral activity and relatively favorable safety profile demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity against mers and sars-cov-2 6970 in the lack of robust evidence antiviral activity immunomodulatory effects and safety profile of nitazoxanide justify further study as a therapeutic option for covid-19 current evidence demonstrates the use of corticosteroids to decrease inflammatory responses in the lungs however this benefit can be overcome by its adverse effects including delayed viral clearance of the respiratory tract and blood and high rates of complications including hyperglycemia psychosis and avascular necrosis as well as increased risk of secondary infection although the direct evidence for the use of corticosteroids in covid-19 is limited result revisions in other viral pneumonias are instructive observational studies in patients with sars and mers have not reported an association of corticosteroids with improved survival 71 72 73 the risk of hyperglycemia in diabetic patients can be reduced although not eliminated by good glycemic control although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of covid-19 no therapy have yet been shown to be efficacious for patients metabolic syndrome is a risk factor that influences covid-19 progression and prognosis the prevalence of obese diabetic hypertensive or liver damage patients with severe cases of covid-19 in multiple countries demonstrates the importance of the care with this risk group in prophylaxis monitoring and treatment similarly the drugs currently evaluated for the infection treatment are promising but need further studies to prove their efficacy and safety due to the adverse effects may be exacerbated by combination therapy or due to viral infection the development of a vaccine for immunization is still the best long-term solution for the prevention of future outbreaks of sars-cov-2 in addition people of any age who have pre-existing diseases such as heart disease diabetes obesity among others also need to redouble their care in measures to prevent coronavirus  is the use of ras inhibitors safe in the current era of covid-19 pandemic sungha park hae lee young eun cho joo ki sung chul juhan kim dae-hee kim sang-hyun ihm kwang-il kim il-suk sohn wook-jin chung hyeon kim chang sung ryu kee wook pyun bum jinho shin   in the era of extremely aging society hypertension is a highly prevalent chronic condition in the elderly that will overlap with many acute conditions such as infection surgery trauma or intoxication infection is an unavoidable clinical problem in the elderly patient taking antihypertensive medications pneumonia and influenza could be fatal in the elderly patients with cardiovascular complications which are the result of long-term hypertension and other risk factors in fact vaccination against pneumonia and influenza is highly recommended in elderly with or without cardiovascular complications recent pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 sars-cov-2 so called coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 are posing a similar challenge in which the majority of fatalities are being observed in the elderly with hypertension diabetes andor their complications antihypertensive drug therapy may have an impact on the clinical practice according to the wide variety of patient conditions it will vary from mild conditions such as poor oral intake volume depletion orthostatic hypotension to severe conditions such as sepsis septic shock myocardial damage overt hear failure acute kidney injury andor multiple organ failure the changes in antihypertensive drug therapy should be based on weighing the risk benefit ratio but there are few specific recommendations to guide the use of antihypertensive drugs in terms of vulnerability to specific infection septic shock andor organ failure there are some general aspects in relation to hypertension management or antihypertensive drug use when some infection is impending or ongoing first of all because hypertension is basically dependent on the sodium balance when sodium or food intake is stopped there could be an increased risk for unexpected blood pressure decrease and hypotension negative sodium balance can be exacerbated by febrile condition and the use of potent diuretics in this situation increase in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ras activation and sympathetic nervous system acts as a compensatory mechanism to mitigate hypotension as such the patient taking potent or long acting ras blockade or beta blocker might be vulnerable to hemodynamic instability compared to calcium antagonist for this issue diuretics does not have blocking effect of compensatory system but it could exacerbate underlying sodium depleting situation these theoretical speculations might be one of possible explanation for the reason why calcium antagonist have superior profile in term of inter-individual visit to visit blood pressure variabilities but despite of all these speculations there is few studies to answer this questions and clinical practice when a patient has asymptomatic hypotension or orthostatic hypotension is solely dependent on the physicians discretions because ras blockade or beta blocker is recommended for the patient with cardiovascular complications stopping these drugs may be harmful in a recent retrospective population based cohort study hsu w et al reported that established ras blockade therapy before sepsis will be protective for the sepsis related mortality 1 these results seems to be in line with the recent study showing depressed sympathetic modulation can be a signal for sepsis in patient with infection 2 some mediators to suppress sympathetic nervous system may be required for sustained hypotension so that those mediators may not be effective if additional blocking is not possible due to already established sympathetic blockade similarly in retrospective studies for heart failure patients withdrawal of ras blockade or beta blocker were associated with poor prognosis 3 4 as such there is no evidence to stop using these drugs in infection patients unless they are associated with hemodynamic instability however in patients with volume depletion and symptomatic hypotension it would be prudent to stop antihypertensive medications and diuretics until blood pressure is normalized and the volume status is recovered in patients who are hemodynamically stable temporarily stopping ras blockade or beta blocker seems to be possible only when the patient has no hypertension related complications such as heart failure coronary artery disease and other vascular complications even in these subjects one should consider the adverse events resulting from rebound increase in blood pressure moreover in the study by ohkubo et al including 6105 patients with a history of stroke andor transient ischemic attack mean age 64 years it was reported that perindopril decreased pneumonia risk in asian but not in non-asian subjects 5 even with those retrospective studies showing that stopping ras blockade or beta blocker is associated with poor prognosis it is not usual to use vasoconstrictor or inotropic without temporary withdrawal of ras blockade or beta blocker in a real world clinical practice for the patient with acute hypotension acute kidney injury or hyperkalemia related to infection 6 besides the toxin supplied by infectious organisms catecholamine or stress induced cardiomyopathy tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy and direct invasion of infectious agents could precipitate hypotension during infection acute hemodynamic instability or hypotension is a serious condition during acute infection which requires stopping or adjustment of antihypertensive drug dosage according to the patients hemodynamic status yearly outbreak of the seasonal flu is a huge burden on the healthcare system and survival in extremely older patients or in patients with high risk profiles such as older age diabetes chronic diseases of the heart kidney lung and liver 7 fortunately there are key available strategies to cope with it which are specific to the infectious agent such as anti-viral therapy vaccination and other preventive approaches hypertension is prevalent in high risk flu patients because they are usually older and with cardiovascular complications but antihypertensive agents could be adjusted according to the general and hemodynamic conditions only after infection begins and it will be only temporary even when the drugs need adjustments there is no issue about adjustment of antihypertensive drug use to protect from infection preemptively because there is no direct involvement of antihypertensive drugs in the infectious process itself in contrast to pandemic flu it is highlighted that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 of the lung type 2 alveolar epithelial cell acts as a non-catalytic receptor for sars-cov-1 and presumably for sars-cov-2 to infect the cell 8 ace2 is reported to be predominantly localized on endothelial cells its mrna is reported to be most highly expressed in testis kidney and heart and also expressed in brain intestine and lungs 9 thus there have been growing concerns about hypertension being a risk factor for severe covid-19 and the possibility of ras inhibitors being an aggravating factor of severe covid-19 due to the theoretical increase in the expression of systemic ace2 with its use the pandemic of sars-cov-2 which began in wuhan china from december 2019 has spread rapidly around the world severe lung damage and high mortality rates have been reported particularly in the elderly and those with comorbidities in particular the high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes suggests that they maybe risk factors for severe covid-19 the prevalence of hypertension is apparently high in patients with severe covid-19 however considering the age of those patients the actual prevalence of hypertension does not seem to be higher zhou et al analyzed the clinical characteristics of 191 patients diagnosed in wuhan among them the average age of deaths n  54 was 69 years and the prevalence of hypertension was 48 which is quite comparable to the prevalence of hypertension in the representative population of those ages 10 until now none of the papers published through multivariate analysis indicated that hypertension was an independent risk factor for severe covid-19 in the study by guan et al reporting the clinical features of 1099 covid-19 patients diagnosed in wuhan the prevalence of hypertension was higher in severe patients n  173 mean age 52 years than in mild patients mean age 45 years237 vs 134 but it was not particularly higher when considering the prevalence of hypertension in that age group 11 therefore there is no scientific evidence to suggest that hypertension itself is an independent risk factor for severe infection or mortality by covid-19 the higher prevalence of hypertension in patients with covid-19 is more likely due to the fact that the age of severe patients was significantly older and because major complications of hypertension such as chronic heart failure cerebral infarction and chronic renal failure make the patient much more vulnerable to progression to severe infection or death in 2004 since the sars-cov-1 outbreak in asia the coronavirus has been shown to use ace2 proteins in the epithelial cell membrane in the lung alveoli as a receptor the viral spikes glycoprotein attaches to the ace2 proteins which have been shown to facilitate viral entry and in theory make the patient vulnerable to lower respiratory tract infection or viral pneumonia 12 13 since the covid-19 outbreak role of ace2 in the pathophysiology of covid-19 has drawn a lot of interest in the social media world as well as scientific groups due to the growing concerns that increased expression of ace2 may increase the risk for severe covid-19 in a recent report the main receptor of the spike s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 is ace2 and its affinity has been reported to be higher than that of sars-cov 1 14 so the key point of concern is that ras inhibitor ace inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker a drug commonly used in hypertensive patients can theoretically raise ace2 expression by a classical feedback system in the biochemical pathway when an enzyme or receptor was blocked fig 1 a when ace2 is activated angiotensin 17 is increased instead of angiotensin ii angiotensin 17 is known to have an effect of protecting cardiovascular diseases by binding to the receptor mas receptor to promote vasodilation antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects 15 on the other hand when it comes to covid-19 the possibility exists that acei or arb can be an exacerbation factor by increasing the expression of ace2 as such there have been increased incidence where patients or physicians change the antihypertensive medications to other drugs or discontinue the drugs due to concerns about the concerns whether real or not for increased risk of severe covid-19 however the korean society of hypertension would like to emphasize that currently there is no scientific basis for taking such measures first there is no epidemiologic evidence for increased severe covid-19 or mortality in patients who were taking ras inhibitors second it is still unclear whether or not ras inhibition results in increased expression of ace2 in systemic level andor tissue including epithelial cells fig 1 even though there are reports that the concentration of ace2 in the blood rises after administration of the first ras blockade there are conflicting reports that also suggest otherwise 16 17 third since ace2 is a receptor for sars-cov-1 and 2 if ras blockade does indeed exacerbates corona virus infection obvious increase in mortality and severe infection in patients receiving ras inhibitor should have been reported during the sars-cov-1 epidemic as we all know this was obviously not the case on the contrary it has been reported that ace2 protects against severe acute lung injury study by deshotels et al have shown that angiotensin ii which is highly activated in severe infection results in increased ace2 internalization and ace2 degradation 18 this has importance implications as the interaction between ace2 and sars-cov-1 is very complex and the net expression of ace2 cannot be predictable in a real patient fig 1 b 19 moreover in vivo studies have shown that decreased ace2 during sars-cov-1 infection exacerbated acute lung injury imai et al conducted experiments by inducing acute lung injury through gastric acid aspiration in mice in ace knockout mice acute lung injury was significantly inhibited whereas in ace2 knockout mice acute lung injury worsened compared to wild type on the other hand acute lung injury was significantly improved by recombinant ace2 administration demonstrating the protective effect of ace2 in acute lung injury 20 in addition kuba et al conducted experiments with the mice sars-cov-1 model the spike protein of sars-cov-1 attaches to ace2 and downregulates ace2 and activates angiotensin ii to exacerbate acute lung injury in contrast ras blockade with losartan 15 mgkg had a protective effect against acute lung injury caused by sars-cov-1 infection fig 1 b given that covid-19 has similar pathophysiological mechanisms to sars-cov-1 infection increase in ace2 or ras blockade might even be protective against severe infection or death
 in summary 1 the prevalence of hypertension in patients with severe covid-19 is high however it is more likely due to the fact that severe patients tend to be older and commonly have complications of hypertension such as heart failure coronary artery disease stroke and ckd currently there is no scientific evidence that hypertension is an independent risk factor for severe infection or death until proven otherwise 2 regarding the concerns for increased risk of severe infection or death due to the theoretical concerns that taking ras inhibitors may increase lung ace2 there is no clinical evidence to suggest that patients taking ras inhibitors may have adverse prognosis during covid-19 in fact it is possible that ras blockade has protective effect against severe covid-19 based on previous reports of their protective effect in animal models of sars-cov-1 infection 3 if ras inhibitors administered due to high blood pressure or other cardiovascular disease were stopped abruptly there is risk for excessive increase in blood pressure that may precipitate cardiovascular complications however we do acknowledge that the above-mentioned issues are valid concerns that deserve more research as quickly as possible but without any scientific evidence to suggest otherwise we the korean society of hypertension endorse the recent recommendation by the european society of cardiology and recommend 1 in hemodynamically stable patients who were taking ras inhibitors to be maintained on ras blockade 2 in hemodynamically stable treatment nave patients who have compelling indication for using ras inhibitors to be administered with ras inhibitors according to the current guidelines 3 in patients without covid-19 to be prescribed with ras inhibitors if there are clinical indications to do so 4 in hemodynamically unstable patients with covid-19 prudent reduction or withdrawal of antihypertensive medications can be considered with consideration for the comorbidities and the indications for using the drugs before the infection in conclusion the use or temporary adjustment of antihypertension drugs during infectious disease could be individualized according to volume status hemodynamic stability comorbid cardiovascular disease profiles and antihypertensive drug class also the use of ras blockade sars-cov-2 pandemic before infection should be maintained based on the current scientific knowledge more researches are needed for the use of antihypertensive drugs before and during severe infection or epidemics  does comorbidity increase the risk of patients with covid-19 evidence from meta-analysis bolin wang ruobao li zhong lu yan huang   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a viral respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov which has caused the pneumonia epidemic in the world 13 as of march 5 2020 a total of 96539 cases with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection have been detected in the world reported by the world health organization who in china there have been 80567 accumulated confirmed cases of covid-19 and 5952 of them were existing severe patients given the rapid spread and high mortality rate of covid-19 it is absolutely necessary to evaluate the possible risk factors affecting the progression of disease in covid-19 patients previous studies show that covid-19 patients with comorbidity may lead to a poor prognosis 5 identifying the most important risk groups is essential when making decisions anti-2019-ncov therapy to date there has been no systematic review that comprehensively explores whether the presence of common comorbidities increase covid-19 patients risk to guide clinical practice better therefore we performed a meta-analysis of the available studies to explore relationship between comorbidity and patients with covid-19 the database searches identified a total of 324 potentially relevant articles after the exclusion of duplicate references243 articles were considered for the meta-analysis of these208 studies were excluded after screening the title and abstract after careful review of the full texts 29 articles were excluded because they were reviews cases and insufficient data six studies qualified for inclusion 1 48 the flow diagram figure 1 showed the detailed literature search steps a total of 1558 samples from 6 retrospective studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis 1 48 all six studies were performed in china six studies 1 48 reported that hypertension diabetes and copd five covered liver disease 1 47 four investigated malignancy 1 4 5 8 renal disease 47 and cardiovascular disease 47 and three 4 5 7 researched cerebrovascular disease two studies 1 5 used whether patients experienced icu care to judge the severity of the disease and the other four studies used clinical symptoms to judge the severity of the disease all articles are of high quality because of nos score no less than 6 detailed descriptions of the studies included are shown in table 1 six studies including 324 severe group cases and 1234 non-severe group cases provided the data in terms of hypertension diabetes and copd 1 48 the heterogeneity test showed low heterogeneity among these studies and a fixed-effects model was used for the meta-analysis the results find that covid-19 patients with hypertension or 229 95 ci 169-310 p0001 figure 2a diabetes or

patients with severe covid-19 1 46 no significant heterogeneity was found i2 0 p0989 among these trials so a fixed effect pattern was selected the results showed that cardiovascular disease is a risk factor for patients with covid-19 or293 95 ci 173-496 p0001 figure 2g three studies provided the data in terms of cerebrovascular disease 4 5 7 a fixed-effects model was used since the heterogeneity

164-922 p0002 figure 2h five studies comprising 313 severe group cases and 1167 non-severe group cases evaluated the role of liver disease in patients with covid-19 1 47 the meta-analysis showed that patients with the previous liver disease did not increase the risk of disease progression or067 95 ci 030-149 p0326 figure 2d the relative risk assessments associated with malignancy and kidney disease are presented in figure 2e and 2f respectively the meta-analysis suggested that there was no correlation between malignant tumor the 95 confidence interval includes 1 or kidney disease p0070 and covid-19 patients aggravation to further verify the correlation of comorbidity and covid-19 patients aggravation subgroup analysis was conducted the results of the subgroup analysis are presented in table 2 the subgroup analysis results further support the results of hypertension copd liver disease and renal disease in the clinical symptom group we further observed that hypertension diabetes copd malignancy and cardiovascular disease were a risk factor in covid-19 patients the risk of publication bias was analyzed in the following comorbidities hypertension diabetes copd and liver disease figure 3 shows the results of publication bias which were evaluated by funnel plots and eggers test beggs test all pr005 and eggers regression test all p 005 suggest no significant publication bias currently the increasing number of cases and extensive geographical expansion of the covid-19 are causing widespread concern in the world 9 tian et al 10 described that the proportion of severe versus common cases of the covid-19 infection which was approximately 14 the ratio of severe to mild were 18 and 73 until now the source and pathogenesis of the covid-19 remain unclear and no specific treatment has been recommended for coronavirus infection except for meticulous supportive care 8 11 unfortunately in severe patients with covid-19 the disease progresses rapidly and respiratory failure can occur within a short time even leading to death early data from wuhan jinyintan hospital showed that 611 of patients in icu had respiratory failure 444 had arrhythmia and 306 had a shock 11 therefore early identification of severe patients is of great significance for improving the therapeutic effect of covid-19 and reducing mortality previous studies have described that the presence of common comorbidities increase covid-19 patients risk 5 besides some scholars think that the presence of any coexisting illness was more common among patients with severe disease than among those with the non-severe disease 4 however the specific comorbidity by which can lead to disease progression remain unknown in covid-19 patients a total of 1558 covid-19 patients were included in the analyses 324 208 of whom were severe the meta-analysis of retrospective studies confirms that copd is associated with a dramatically increased risk of aggravation in patients with covid-19 covid-19 patients with copd had a 59-fold higher risk of progression than patients without copd moreover we identify an increased risk of aggravation in individuals who have hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease our meta-analysis did not provide sufficient evidence that there was a correlation between liver disease malignant tumor or kidney disease and covid-19 patients aggravation however this conclusion needs to be taken with caution as this study has several limitations firstly the small sample size may reduce the significance of the results secondly the judgment criteria for severe and non-severe patients included in the study were not uniform thirdly some included patients who had more than one coexisting illness fourth the quality of different studies was different which might lead to bias the meta-analysis identified hypertension diabetes copd cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease as significant risk factors for covid-19 patients the knowledge of these factors can better define those covid-19 patients at higher risk and thus allow a more targeted and specific approach to prevent those deaths given the limitations of this conclusion well-designed trials of high quality are needed to explore the relationship between comorbidity and patients with covid-19 the meta-analysis was performed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis prisma statement 12 relevant literature was extracted by systematic retrieval of pubmed medline embase springer web of science

bryce beutler d alastair moody e zahara kanji nageshwara gullapalli christopher rowan j   coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide as of this writing over half a million cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infections have been recorded a global arms race for a vaccine or viable therapy is currently underway however most experts project that development of a vaccine will take at least 18 mo1 and an effective pharmacologic treatment has yet to be discovered it therefore appears increasingly likely that covid-19 will become embedded in the fabric of modern medicine for years to come management of chronic illnesses in patients with covid-19 should be considered a priority hypertension affects over 14 billion individuals worldwide2 and has been associated with markedly increased morbidity and mortality in the setting of covid-1934 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceis and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs are among the most frequently prescribed antihypertensive agents throughout most of the developed world5 these drugs are safe well-tolerated and effective as a first-line therapy however emerging evidence suggests that aceis and arbs may increase patient susceptibility to sars-cov-2 host cell entry and propagation by upregulation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 viral binding site6-8 there is insufficient data to recommend withdrawal of aceis and arbs among individuals who have been diagnosed with covid-19 indeed most major medical organizations  including the american heart association and european society of cardiology  recommend maintaining acei or arb therapy in all hypertensive patients with covid-19 however we propose that an alternative agent should be considered in patients presenting with covid-19 and a new diagnosis of hypertension verapamil is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that was once used for the management of hypertension it has largely been supplanted by aceis arbs and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in the modern era verapamil is primarily used for rate control in supraventricular tachycardia migraine prophylaxis and hypertension with co-morbid atrial fibrillation we believe that this drug may be appropriate as a first-line agent for the management of hypertension in patients with covid-19 preliminary data from animal studies have demonstrated that verapamil has no effect on ace2 expression furthermore it has been shown to ameliorate the clinical and pathological course of viral myocarditis in murine models indeed in a study of mice inoculated with encephalomyocarditis virus investigators found that those treated with verapamil before andor during infection exhibited markedly less cardiac inflammation and necrosis as compared to an untreated group9 cardiac involvement  and specifically sars-cov-2-associated myocarditis  represents a serious and potentially fatal manifestation of covid-1910 management of hypertension with a drug that may reduce inflammation in viral myocarditis and does not pose a theoretical risk of promoting covid-19 proliferation would appear to be a rational strategy to optimize patient outcomes carvedilol a nonselective -adrenoreceptor antagonist with additional 1-adrenergic blocking properties represents another promising antihypertensive agent in the setting of covid-19 similar to verapamil carvedilol attenuates inflammation in murine models of acute viral myocarditis in a study of mice infected with coxsackie b3 virus those receiving carvedilol exhibited superior survival as compared to an untreated group and those treated with metoprolol11 the mechanism of action is unclear but it has been postulated that carvedilol exerts anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of peroxidants in the myocardium carvedilol also has the added benefit of reducing heart rate which may reduce myocyte injury and ventricular remodeling in the setting of myocarditis12 notably there are demonstrable anti-inflammatory effects associated with upregulation of ace2 indeed lung function improvement with acei or arb treatment has been described in the setting of covid-1913 however irrespective of the purported benefits of aceis and arbs the potential of these agents to facilitate viral disease remains under investigation in conclusion we believe that verapamil or carvedilol should be considered for the management of hypertension in patients at risk of covid-19 the pathogenic mechanisms of sars-cov-2 remain under investigation but data suggest that the ace2 receptor plays a central role in infection it is therefore theoretically possible that drugs known to increase ace2 expression such as aceis and arbs could promote covid-19 proliferation we are in agreement with the recommendation of major medical societies to maintain acei or arb therapy in individuals who are already receiving treatment however patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension who are at risk of covid-19 would likely benefit from verapamil or carvedilol as these agents effectively control blood pressure and may conceivably attenuate inflammation and necrosis in sars-cov-2 myocarditis  biomedical science review acute respiratory distress syndrome hsing chen i shang kao jyh david wang c ru ping lee chain fa su  shin kong wu ho-su memorial hospital  taipei  acute respiratory distress syndrome ards can be associated with various disorders among these coronavirus infection may cause life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in this review we present animal models and techniques for the study of ards and discuss the roles and possible mechanisms of various chemical factors including nitric oxide no our early work revealed that cerebral compression elicits severe hemorrhagic pulmonary edema pe leading to central sympathetic activation that results in systemic vasoconstriction the consequence of systemic vasoconstriction is volume and pressure loading in the pulmonary circulation vasodilators but not oxidant radical scavengers are effective in the prevention of centrogenic pe in isolated perfused lung exogenous and endogenous no enhances lung injury following air embolism and ischemiareperfusion in contrast no synthase nos inhibitors reverse such lung injury although no is important in maintaining vasodilator tone hypoxiainduced pulmonary vasoconstriction is accompanied by an increase instead of a decrease in no release in animal and isolated lung studies endotoxin produces acute lung injury that is associated with increases in cytokines and inducible nos mrna expression suggesting that no is toxic to the lung in endotoxin shock recently we reported several rare cases that indicate that ards in patients with japanese b encephalitis lymphangitis with breast cancer and fat embolism is caused by different mechanisms our early and recent studies on ards and pe may provide information for clinical practice and the understanding of the pathogenesis of sars  the recent outbreak of the life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in many countries has resulted in deaths of patients infected by coronavirus 22 23 28 34  in addition to sars acute respiratory distress syndrome ards can be induced by various disorders accordingly investigations of the mechanism of ards can further our understanding of the yet unknown mechanism of sars in this brief review we present early and recent studies in animal and human subjects with either ards or acute pulmonary edema pe a series of studies on neurogenic pe resulting from cerebral compression or intracranial hypertension suggest that brain injuries initiate massive central sympathetic activation this in turn causes systemic vasoconstriction and shift of blood from the systemic circulation to the lung 2-4 6 8 9 11 12 14  in an isolated lung that is subject to air embolism ischemiareperfusion ir or endotoxin nitric oxide no is detrimental to lung tissues and causes acute injury although it reduces pulmonary hypertension 21 24 36  recently we reported 19 that in patients with diseases of rare causes ards is induced by several other mechanisms in patients with japanese b encephalitis the viral infection destroys depressor areas in the medulla implying that central sympathetic activation might be the cause of ards on the other hand no cgmp and serotonin are possibly involved in ards due to fat embolism we suggest that further investigation of the involvement of no central nervous lesions and other chemical factors will advance our understanding of sars caused by coronavirus infection our early studies used whole animals mainly rats of the sprague-dawley strain to investigate the mechanism of neurogenic pe induced by cerebral compression 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  right and left heart bypass were employed to elucidate the importance of cardiac output and venous return in the genesis of pulmonary pathology 8  a technique of regional weighing described by fell and rushmer 15 was used to demonstrate the shift of blood volume from the systemic circulation to the lung 2 9 10 11 14  the total heart bypass technique has allowed us to perfuse the systemic and pulmonary circulation with constant flow we examined systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics in response to intracranial hypertension and found that intracranial hypertension causes an increase in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and a decrease in capacity  13  spectral analysis for the assessment of steady and pulsatile hemodynamics demonstrated that intracranial hypertension causes an increase in characteristic impedance wave reflection and total peripheral resistance along with a decrease in cardiac output 32  in sprague-dawley rats endotoxin causes systemic hypotension with an increase in cytokine and inducible no synthase inos mrna expression in the injured lung these changes are attenuated by nos inhibitors such as n-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester l-name ss-i4phenylene-bis-12-ethanedinyt bis-isothiourea dihydrobromide and dexamethasone 37  a good preparation for the study of acute lung injury is isolated lungs in situ 17 18 21  a previous method involved removing the isolated lung from the body and placing it on a force-displacement transducer to record the change in lung weight because this procedure is rather complicated and unstable we invented a device for measuring the change in lung weight by a scale the isolated perfused lung is not removed from the body instead the whole body is placed on a scale platform and a digital-analogue converter records the change in lung weight on a recorder in the isolated lung preparation lung weight gain lung weightbody weight ratio microvascular permeability and protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage could be measured and calculated to evaluate the extent of lung injury as well as to determine the pulmonary vascular tone wang et al 36 found that in an isolated lung l-arginine and inhaled no increased lung injury induced by air embolism while l-name attenuated it mecaprine an agent that reduces oxygen free radicals also protects the lung from acute injury following ir 29  it was surprising to find that hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction is associated with an increased release of no from the lung 35  this observation is in contrast with the notion that no is a vasodilator and that the reduction of no may lead to vasoconstriction in endotoxic shock no was shown to be harmful to the lung and the major site of no formation is in the lung not the organs 24  no also mediates lung damage following ir l-arginine and inhaled no enhance ir-induced pe while nos inhibitors reverse ir lung injury 21  a recently-developed animal model of conscious and unrestrained rats is now available 26  with this model the condition of the animals can be observed and arterial pressure heart rate and biochemical factors can be measured for more than 72 h without anesthesia we used this novel model to investigate the physiological and chemical indicators for early and late stages of sepsis-associated pulmonary injury 25  extensive studies using this technique have been carried out in our laboratory pe induced by cerebral compression is not affected by cholinergic blockers atropine or beta-adrenergic blockers propranol however it is prevented by a-adrenergic blocking agents phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine norepinephrine depleter respine and a sympathetic neuronal blocker bretylium high doses of intravenous nor-epinephrine angiotensin and vasopressin induce severe systemic vasoconstriction and pe 4  previous studies have demonstrated that vasodilators such as nitroprusside and nitroglycerin cause a dosedependent attenuation of neurogenic pe while oxidant scavengers such as dimethylthiourea and superoxide dismutase exert no significant effect on centrogenic pe 7  no is an important substance in the regulation of arterial pressure 5 6 20 27 30  since no is a free radical however it may lead to the formation of hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite which are toxic to many organs including the lung 27 33 38  thus the effects of exogenous and endogenous no were investigated in our recent studies on tung injury induced by various disorders in sprague-dawley rats endotoxin produces systemic hypotension accompanied by enhancement of cytokines tumor necrosis factor and interleukins and inos mrna expression 37  in isolated perfused lung exogenous and endogenous no is detrimental to the lung following air embolism and ir 29 36  the endotoxininduced ards was found to be caused by large amounts of no release in the lung 24  the ir-induced lung injury is exacerbated by no inhalation and l-arginine administration but is attenuated by an nos inhibitor l-name 21   in patients with fat embolism due to long bone fracture the plasma levels of cgmp and nitratenitrite are significantly increased suggesting that no is involved in ards associated with fat embolization 19  our early work indicated that massive sympathetic drive is responsible for the pathogenesis ofneurogenic pe pe induced by cerebral compression is not affected by vagotomy and adrenalectomy but is prevented by spinal transaction 12 14  in rats under monitoring of aortic and pulmonary blood flow cerebral compression causes a dramatic decrease in aortic flow cardiac output to less than 50 of the basal value the pulmonary flow then slowly declines we showed that the imbalance in right and left cardiac output resulted in the accumulation of blood in the lung 8  furthermore we used right and left heart bypass in that study in the left heart bypass aortic flow was kept constant the lung change was not discernible following cerebral compression in the right heart bypass the pulmonary flow was constant and the left cardiac output was allowed to change cerebral compression produced severe pe these findings suggest that the decrease in left ventricular output is the major cause of pe venous return however is not essential in another study regional sympathectomy was performed to elucidate the participation of various vascular beds in neurogenic pe 10  splanchnic sympathectomy by dissection of the splanchnic nerves and celiac plexus almost completely prevented pe induced by cerebral compression on the other hand pulmonary sympathetic denervation by excising the thoracic sympathetic chains from the stellate ganglia to t4 attenuated the extent of pe by approximately 30 these results suggest that sympathetic splanchnic vasoconstriction is essential for the production of neurogenic pe and that pulmonary sympathetic vasoconstriction is not the major factor involved when the lung is distended by accumulation of blood volume pulmonary vasoconstriction can however cause an additional effect to enhance the pulmonary venous hypertension and pe hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction is a well-known phenomenon the physiological significance is that capillary flow to hypoxic alveoli can be reduced and the flow is thus shifted to oxygenated alveoli it has been speculated that inadequate no formation may be responsible for the increased vascular tone pulmonary vasoconstriction and hypertension for reviews see ref 6 27  this contention was challenged by a study from our laboratory 35  an no detector probe was placed in the pulmonary vein in isolated perfused tung real-time no monitoring revealed that no release was increased accompanied by pulmonary arterial hypertension following hypoxia l-arginine was able to potentiate no release and reduce the pulmonary hypertension while l-name produced opposite effects these findings suggest that continuous no release from the lung maintains pulmonary arterial pressure and that insufficient no formation is not the cause of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in this connection studies from our laboratory 5 6 20 also contest the early consensus that impairment of endothelial function and no formation is the cause of hypertension due to reduction of the vasodilatory effect of no for a review see ref  27  pulmonary arterial pressure microvascular permeability lung weightbody weight ratio and protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage have been measured or calculated before and after air embolism ir and endotoxin administration in isolated perfused lung no only exerts a beneficial effect on the increase in pulmonary arterial pressure pulmonary hypertension this substance mediates the induction of acute lung injury induced by air embolism ir and endotoxin administration 2 t 24 36  in the case of sepsis the no concentration is increased in exhaled air thus acting as an early marker of lung inflammation  16 31  we found that no production is mainly from the lung furthermore the extent of acute lung injury and the no concentration in exhaled air are greatly reduced in tung perfused with physiological solution when compared to lung perfused with whole blood 24  this finding suggests that cellular elements are essential to the production of no and lung injury these changes are attenuated by pretreatment with l-name aminoguanidine and dexamethasone suggesting that inos is involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced pe exogenous and endogenous no also causes lung injury following ir 211 in conscious and unrestrained rats following intravenous infusion of lipopolysaccharide lps 10 mgkg hypotension and plasma nitritenitrate reached a peak at 9-12 h this finding indicates that increased no release accounts for the systemic hypotension plasma amylase reached a peak at 18-24 h after lps infusion the increase in plasma amylase may be an indication of multiple organ damage in the late stage of sepsis postmortem examination of the lung revealed a slight increase in lung weight compared to normal lung lung injury was mild 25  higher doses of lps may be required to induce severe pe and changes in biochemical factors may be used to elucidate the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in this conscious rat model our recent report of ards patients suggests that cerebral compression air embolism ir and endotoxin are not the only causes of ards 19  in patients with japanese b encephalitis viral destruction of the depressor areas may induce central sympathetic activation resulting in ards disruption of a cerebral aneurysm can cause severe intracranial hypertension and ards obstruction of lymphatic drainage can also lead to severe ards in fat embolism biochemical mediators such as cgmp no and serotonin may be involved in the pathogenesis of ards japanese b encephalitis demonstrate viral destruction of the medullary depressor areas the release of sympathetic drive may be the cause of ards due to viral lesions in the brain chang et al 1 reported that patients with enterovirus infection demonstrated hand foot and mouth lesions and in the most dramatic case ards ensued unfortunately pathological examination of the brain was not reported in their study the outbreaks of sars from early to mid-2003 resulted in high mortality the mechanism of coronavirus-induced sars is still unknown it may be interesting to see whether coronavirus andor enterovirus introduced into the animal can produce brain lesions as observed in patients with japanese b encephalitis a recent observation by hsu et al unpubl data revealed that ards occurred after rabies infection as a consequence of a brain lesion similar to that seen in japanese b encephalitis research with isolated lung used no substrate and blockers to elucidate the detrimental role of no in the acute injury caused by air embolism ir and endotoxin we are now extending this research with the measurement of biochemical factors and expression of mrna for cytokines and nos in the conscious rat model investigation of dosedependent changes in physiological parameters biochemical factors and pathological changes should be carried out in order to observe dose-dependent organ injury including that in the lung experimental results in animals with chronic deprivation of constitutive nos and inos and with no knock-in or knock-out may further elucidate the involvement of different nos forms in the pathogenesis of ards  diabetes mellitus hypertension and death among

hospitalization eleven died in the hospital all of whom required ventilatory support case-patients with multiple and more severe underlying conditions generally had worse clinical course and outcomes than those without these conditions figure appendix table of the 11 case-patients with no dm or hypertension 100 survived as did all patients with dm but without hypertension or cod in comparison 2 40 of 5 with dm and hypertension but without cod died and 9 82 of 11 with dm or hypertension and with cod died appendix table in a previous study 5 dm chronic lung disease heart disease and smoking were identified as underlying health conditions and behaviors associated with primary infection with mers-cov alqahtani et al reported that dm hypertension cardiac disease renal disease and bronchial asthma were frequent underlying conditions associated with death of mers-cov-infected patients and also found that the risk for death increased for patients with multiple comorbidities 3 we found that dm hypertension and cod co-occurred frequently in mers-covinfected patients and severity of illness and frequency of death were higher for patients with multiple and more severe underlying conditions further studies are necessary to better clarify the mechanisms that lead to severe outcomes among these patients for case-patients infected with mers-cov the presence and compounding of underlying conditions including dm hypertension and ultimately cod corresponded with an increasingly complicated clinical course and death these findings indicate that increased clinical vigilance is warranted for patients with multiple and severe underlying conditions who are suspected of being infected with mers-cov  prevalence of comorbidities in patients and mortality cases affected by sars-cov2 a systematic review and meta-analysis omar espinosa ariel andernice zanetti dos ednardo antunes fornanciari fabiana longhi gulin tatiane de matos amorim paula battaglini franciene   the 2019 pandemic coronavirus covid-19 has affected more than three million people in 211 countries causing more than two hundred thousand deaths as of the end of april 20201 the etiologic agent of this disease is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 which is transmitted through contact with infected persons or contaminated fluids23 several risk factors are associated with this disease in a multicenter cohort study advanced age was found to be significantly correlated with overall covid-19 prevalence which is consistent with the higher incidence observed in older adults4 the sex is another risk factor as a higher prevalence has been seen in men than women4 other studies have shown that the presence of any comorbidity increases the chances of covid-19 infection causing respiratory failure and death in patients5 another study reports that patients admitted to the intensive care unit icu had a higher number of comorbidities 722 than those not admitted to the icu 3736 hence comorbidities are considered a risk factor for fatality and data from other reports show up to a 90 prevalence of comorbidities in fatal cases7 with cardiovascular diseases diabetes hypertension chronic obstructive pulmonary disease being the most prevalent known comorbidities in covid-19 cases8 currently several published studies describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients and mortality cases affected by covid-19 in different parts of the world for this reason the aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the prevalence and geographical distribution of comorbidities in all patients in those admitted to the icu and in mortality cases affected by covid-19 using the previously published data what is the prevalence of comorbidities in all patients patients admitted to the icu and in fatal cases affected by the new coronavirus covid-19 this review considered studies that conducted epidemiological and clinical descriptions in patients and in fatal cases from different parts of the world in order to determine the prevalence and geographic distribution of comorbidities in patients affected by covid-19 an initial search limited to medline was performed using mesh index terms and related keywords this search was followed by an analysis of the words in the text of the title abstract and index terms used to describe the articles a second search using all the identified keywords and index terms was conducted on may 15 2020 using the following databases latin american and caribbean health sciences literature lilacs the bibliographic database of the us national of medicine medline the elsevier database embase web of science and scopus the mesh index term search included covid-19 sars-cov2 prevalence and comorbidity as covid-19 is a recent topic thesis and dissertation papers have not yet been published and were not evaluated the articles selected for data recovery were analyzed by two independent reviewers who assessed the methodological validity of each text before their inclusion in this review the quality of the publications included were evaluated based on the criteria derived from the grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation method grade points were awarded to the studies if they did not present limitations in study design or execution risk of bias inconsistency of results evidence based on indirect data imprecision and publication bias a score of four to five points was considered as high quality three points as moderate quality and zero to two points as low quality the data were added to the review manager revman 53 for analysis a data extraction table was created to assess the quality of demographic data study location sample size number of cases number of positives and the diagnostic test the random-effect model meta-analysis method was used to analyze the pooled prevalence of comorbidities in patients and in fatal cases affected by covid-19 in different parts of the world the heterogeneity among the studies was analyzed using the higgins test i2 that shows the percentage of variation among studies these analyses were compiled by using the stata software version 12 statacorp llc texas usa the odds ratio test with a 95 confidence interval 95 ci was calculated to measure the likelihood of death for a patient with a comorbidity compared to a patient without comorbidities in the 39 studies used to calculate the pooled prevalence of comorbidities 89238 patients affected by covid-19 were analyzed 11341 127 presented one or more comorbidities 2172 24 were admitted to the icu and 3532 4  patients died the patients age range was 41 to 70 years among these studies only one was conducted in the usa43 and included a large number of patients 74439 but did not segregate patients according to sex in the other 38 studies 14844 patients were registered with a total of 8518 574 males and 6413 426 females the reported comorbidities included hypertension

each disease is shown in table 2 the probability of a patient with comorbidity of dying from covid-19 and the significance of this associations using the fishers exact test were calculated the number of patients with comorbidities who died and those who survived in addition to the patients without comorbidities who died and who survived were used to calculate an odds ratio of 24 with 95 ci 17-33 and in the fishers exact test the value of p  00001 this meta-analysis was based on 42 studies including a large number of descriptions from china and the united states studies conducted in india italy the united kingdom south korea and singapore were also analyzed a higher prevalence of male patients infected with covid-19 was observed compared to females this predisposition of the male sex was also observed in the diseases mers-cov and sars-co which are also caused by viruses of the coronavirus family4950 the pooled prevalence of comorbidities in the general population of patients affected by the new coronavirus covid-19 was 42 95 ci 2659 china was the country with the highest prevalence although there were also more studies analyzed from this country however it is important to highlight that two studies from the united states resulted in contrasting prevalence values 4 and 94 since the united states is the country that leads the statistics so far with the highest number of confirmed cases more than one million and deaths from coronavirus more than seventy thousand on may 8 2020 it is of utmost importance to publish more data on the clinical characteristics of the disease in this country the results of this study confirm that the prevalence of comorbidities increases as the patients clinical conditions worsens in the general population affected by covid-19 the prevalence of comorbidities was 42 61 among patients admitted to the icu and 77 among fatal cases males were the most affected in the three groups on the other hand the mean age also increases when we compare the group of patients in general with the group of fatal cases as previously described among risk factors such as age sex and comorbidities4-7 regarding comorbidities in the three groups analyzed general population admission to icu and fatal cases hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity accounting for 32 26 and 35 respectively in the general population diabetes was the second-most prevalent 22 comorbidity followed by heart disease 13 and copd 8 however in patients admitted to the icu diabetes 17 and heart disease 18 showed similar values the same phenomenon was observed in fatal cases with diabetes 19 and heart disease 17 showing similar values considering that type 1 diabetes mellitus usually manifests during childhood or adolescence type 2 diabetes frequently manifests in adults and heart diseases are more prevalent in older patients one may think that the earlier onset of diabetes may account for it to rank second among the comorbidities in the general population affected by covid-19 on the other hand the group of fatal cases is composed of predominantly older adults a population in which hypertension diabetes and heart disease are prevalent the odds ratio for any comorbidity was 24 with 95 ci 17-33 with a statistical significance of p  00001 in other words a patient with a comorbidity has 24 times the chance of dying from covid-19 compared to a patient without a comorbidity this may explain the high prevalence of comorbidities among fatal cases in developing this study we encountered several limitations firstly not all studies segregated epidemiological and clinical data age sex percentage of comorbidity and patients hospitalized in the icu secondly some studies classified comorbidities in the other category but only one study described which diseases were comprised in this category thirdly since china is the primary focus of the rise of the pandemic most of the studies included were from this country no studies from africa oceania or latin america were found finally in meta-analyses it is recommended that publication bias are always assessed by statistical methods however currently available methods such as the funnel plot and the egger regression test are not considered useful tools in studies on proportions51 one can conclude that the existence of comorbidities increases the probability of dying from covid-19 by 24 times compared to those who do not have pre-existing conditions the most relevant comorbidities were shown to be hypertension heart disease and diabetes thus comorbidities are more prevalent in the group of mortality cases when compared to the general population group however these conclusions are based on the evidence obtained mostly from studies conducted in china for this reason studies describing the epidemiological and clinical profiles of covid-19 cases in africa oceania and latin america are recommended to clarify the behavior of this disease in these regions and thus be able to apply effective measures aimed at safeguarding populations at risk  outcomes in patients with covid-19 infection taking aceiarb juan rico-mesa simon averi white allen anderson s   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is the virus responsible for covid-19 a global pandemic with catastrophic consequences for healthcare systems and populations around the world sars-cov-2 was initially described in december 2019 in wuhan china 1 the virus rapidly escalated and on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared it a pandemic sars-cov-2 shares similarities with sars-cov the virus responsible for the 20022003 sars epidemic and middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers the virus responsible for mers 2 following the sars epidemic researchers extensively investigated the pathophysiologic mechanisms of sars-cov infection including the interaction of the virus with the heart and lungs based on these studies researchers believe that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor located on alveolar epithelial cells serves as a high affinity receptor and co-transporter for sars-cov-2 to enter the lungs 3 medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors acei block ace2 receptors which may predispose or protect against covid-19 infection this editorial summarizes the current scientific evidence surrounding this subject in order to guide clinical practice the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas maintains plasma sodium concentration via feedback from blood pressure baroreceptors and sodium and potassium levels first the kidneys secrete renin which metabolizes angiotensinogen into angiotensin i next the kidneys and lungs secrete ace which converts angiotensin i into angiotensin ii finally angiotensin ii stimulates vasoconstriction cardiovascular response and aldosterone and adh production this ultimately increases blood pressure and body fluid volume through sodium potassium and free water resorption 3 ace2 receptor a homolog of the angiotensin i-converting enzyme ace receptor is a type i transmembrane aminopeptidase with high expression in heart and lung tissue 4 but which is also expressed in the endothelium and kidney see fig 1 illustrating the raas activation pathway discovered in 2000 ace2 receptor appears to counter-regulate raas activation by degrading angiotensin ii 5 the raas system is widely implicated in dm hypertension and heart failure acei and arb drugs based upon strong evidence of efficacy are commonly used in the management of hypertension heart failure post myocardial infarction care and to slow progression of renal disease associated with diabetes with the exponential rise of covid-19 cases worldwide observational studies have identified risk factors for infection and poor outcomes three separate studies identified hypertension and dm as highly prevalent among covid-19 patientsaaccording to yang et al among 52 critically ill patients dm was present in 17 of cases 6baccording to guan et al among 1099 patients dm was present in 162 of cases and hypertension was present in 237 of cases 7caccording to zhang et al among 140 hospitalized patients dm was present in 12 of cases and hypertension was present in 30 of cases 8 while both hypertension and dm are treated with acei and arb medication use was not assessed in any of the three aforementioned studies leading to an inconclusive hypothesis however one study to date has analyzed the effect of acei and arb use on the covid-19 population according to peng et al among 112 patients cardiovascular comorbidities led to worse outcomes with most deaths occurring secondary to fulminant inflammation lactic acidosis and thrombotic states 9 acei and arb use did not influence morbidity or mortality 9 in addition to these observations there is a well-known association between the viruses sars-cov and mers-cov and deleterious cardiac events including cardiac injury in sars-cov as well as myocarditis and heart failure in mers-cov 10 furthermore sars-cov-2 was recently associated with cardiac injury defined by a troponin  28 pgml or electrocardiogramechocardiogram abnormalities in 12 of patients from a covid-19 cohort these data demonstrate a cardiac affinity with all three viruses 11 the etiology of cardiac damage in patients with covid-19 is unclear but ace2 receptors may play a role given the high affinity of sars-cov for ace2 receptors 12 a recent commentary published in the lancet respiratory medicine hypothesizes that the use of ace2 receptor increasing drugs is at higher risk for severe covid-19 infection acei initially inhibits ace leading to decreased angiotensin i levels causing a possible negative feedback loop that ultimately upregulates more ace2 receptor to be able to interact with the decreased angiotensin i substrate available 13 see fig 1 this ace2 receptor upregulation results in increased binding sites for sars-cov-2 leading to preferential covid-19 infection this is particularly observed in patients with diabetes andor hypertension since they are usually taking acei or arb 12 this comment was released before the findings published by peng et al 9 an editorial response by sommerstein et al 14 based on the findings by ferrario et al showing a 5-fold increase in ace2 levels with lisinopril and 3-fold increase in ace2 levels with losartan 15 was published in the british medical journal conversely some investigators argue that acei or arb use may be beneficial in covid-19 infection prevention li et al for example proposed that acei inhibition of ace may stimulate a negative feedback given the lack of angiotensin ii upregulating ace2 receptors and decreasing overall inflammation 16 sun et al argued that acei use im pairs the aceangiotensin iiangiotensin-1 receptor pathway therefore impairing the integrity of the ace2angiotensin 17mas mas-related g protein-coupled receptor a disruption of the ace2angiotensin 17mas pathway could lead to decreased production of ace2 decreasing chances of sars-cov-2 entering the cell 17 some raas inactivated animal models demonstrate symptom relief in acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure through vasoconstriction mechanisms 17 recent findings also demonstrate that patients on the arb olmesartan had increased secretion of urinary ace2 likely from an upregulation mechanism although unclear 18 despite this hypothesis of ace2 upregulation a causal relationship decreasing mortality has not been demonstrated finally given the contradictory hypotheses rapidly evolving nature of the disease and social media-related hysteria several cardiology associations hfsaaccaha and esc hypertension council released an official statement regarding the continuation of acei and arb for covid-19 patients 19 the associations strongly recommend continuing treatment with aceiarb in patients who were previously taking either class of medication there is a lack of scientific evidence and clinical data to support discontinuing acearb use in patients with covid-19 and co-existing heart failure hypertension or ischemic heart disease the well-studied reduction in mortality conferred by acearb use and the beneficial effects for patients with diabetes chronic kidney disease and proteinuria or albuminuria currently outweigh the theoretical risks as the covid-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and affect more patients with cardiovascular comorbidities further research is needed to clarify the accuracy of existing hypotheses  physiological and pathological regulation of ace2 the sars-cov-2 receptor yanwei li wei zhou li yang ran you   the renin-angiotensin system ras maintains the homeostasis of blood pressure and the balance of fluid and salts 1 the homeostasis of ras is critical for the physiological and pathological regulation in various organs including the heart kidneys and lungs 1 angiotensin-converting enzyme ace 2 is a potent negative regulator of ras which is critical for maintaining the homeostasis of ras 23 the human ace2 gene is located on chromosome xp22 and includes 18 exons functioning as a typical zinc metallopeptidase ace2 protein which contains 805 amino acids is a type i integral membrane glycoprotein containing a single catalytic domain 3 in ras ace2 degrades angiotensin ang ii which is potent in vasoconstriction pro-inflammation and pro-fibrosis and converts it into ang 1-7 which is vasodialatic anti-proliferative and apoptotic 3 besides the systemic effect in blood pressure regulation ace2 has local regulatory effects in the pathological changes in several organs including the heart kidneys and lungs 2 ace2 also regulates the amino acid absorption in the kidney and the gut and modulates the expression of transporters for amino acid 2 ace2 was identified as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov which could rapidly cause acute lung failure in humans 4 hence ace2 is vital for the viral entry to the host cells during sars-cov infection coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic as declared by the world health organization on 11 march 2020 5 has accumulated over one million confirmed cases globally as of the early april 2020 6 epidemiological study revealed that covid-19 infected people of all ages 8 the elderly and co-morbid patients are at higher risk of having poor clinical outcomes and prognosis 89 high-throughput sequencing identified the pathogen of covid-19 as a novel betacoronavirus 10 which was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses 11 comparing to sars-cov sars-cov-2 is more infective for causing more than 120 times of infections globally 1051635 confirmed cases of covid-19 as of 4 april 2020 6 vs 8096 sars patients 12 but seems to be less virulent because only parts of the patients showed similar severity as sars-cov infection 8 also the global case fatality rate of covid-19 was 54  569851051635 according to the data on 4 april 2020 6 which was lower than that of sars-cov infection 96  7748096 12 similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 mainly transmits through respiratory droplets and direct contact according to the reported cases 813 also the entry of sars-cov-2 to the host cells requires binding with the receptor via the s-spike on the surface of the virus 10 computational modeling 1014 and viral infection experiments using hela cells that express ace2 protein from humans chinese horseshoe bats civets pigs and mice 15 provided evidence that ace2 is the receptor for sars-cov-2 results in the cryo-em experiments demonstrated that sars-cov-2 had a ten times higher affinity to ace2 comparing to sars-cov which was consistent with the higher efficiency of infection of sars-cov-2 16 these findings indicated that ace2 might be crucial for the human infection of sars-cov-2 and for the progression and prognosis of covid-19 understanding the expression and activity of ace2 under different physiological and pathological conditions may help to predict the susceptibility of sars-cov-2 in different cohorts of people and the clinical outcomes and prognosis of covid-19 patients in the present review we will summarize the regulation and function of ace2 in different physiological and pathological states and discuss the potential implication in sars-cov-2 infection-induced covid-19 organs that express a higher level of ace2 are potential targets of sars-cov-2 infection therefore the distribution and abundance of ace2 in organs may be closely related to the clinical symptoms of covid-19 it is known that ace2 is enriched in the heart kidneys and testes and is also broadly distributed in the lungs liver intestine and brain 2 the lung is the primary target organ of sars-cov-2 infection 8917 most of the hospitalized patients infected with sars-cov-2 developed pneumonia which was typically characterized as ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing in chest computed tomography 817 pathological examination on the biopsy samples obtained from a deceased covid-19 patient revealed diffused alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs 18 an analysis of the single-cell rna sequencing data obtained from 43134 human lung cells revealed that 064  of cells in lungs expressed ace2 and 83  of ace2 was expressed on type ii apical surface of epithelial cells at2 19 other types of cells including type i apical epithelial cells airway epithelial cells fibroblasts endothelial cells and macrophages also express ace2 at lower levels than at2 19 these results indicated that at2 is likely to be the primary target of sars-cov-2 in the lungs 19 in addition to respiratory symptoms the common complications found in patients infected with sars-cov-2 include acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury 917 rectal swabs stool urine and saliva sampled from some covid-19 patients were positive for the sars-cov-2 virus 8 these findings demonstrated the broad distribution of sars-cov-2 in humans whose pattern was similar to the distribution of ace2 an analysis on the single-cell rna sequencing data from human organs revealed that cells that express ace2 included 75  of cardiomyocyte 4  of proximal tubular epithelial cells 24  of bladder urothelial cells 30  of ileum epithelial cells 1  of esophageal epithelial cell and 2  of respiratory tract epithelial cells 20 sars-cov-2 may attack these cells after binding with ace2 the tissue damage and inflammation may cause severe complications that may worsen the clinical outcomes moreover positive detection of the rna of sars-cov-2 in the samples of gastrointestinal tissues and stool from covid-19 patients suggested that fecal-oral transmission might be possible 21 it is noteworthy that the placental villi and the uterus also express ace2 2223 indicating the possibility of vertical maternal-fetal transmission current reports on clinical observations indicated that this transmission route is possible 24 25 26 but may be low risk 2728 some of the sex hormones affect the homeostasis of ras although the ace2 activity showed no difference between the male and female 29 the males have higher expression levels of ace2 in the lungs compared to the females 19 moreover at least five types of cells in the lungs from the males express ace2 while only two to four types in the females lungs do so 19 consistent with these findings the sars-cov-2 infected males were slightly but not statistically significantly higher than the females 581  vs 419  in a survey included 1099 patients 8 the female sex hormones may affect ace2 29 the aceace2 activity ratio in the male serum is higher than that in the females which may partially attribute to the activation effect of estrogen on ace2 activity 30 during pregnancy the fluctuation of hormones may drastically change the expression of ace2 both in the reproductive system and in other organs 23 the ace2 mrna expression in the uterus of pregnant rats was significantly higher than the one in the unpregnant rats 23 indicating the implication of progesterone in the regulation of ace2 expression 31 similar up-regulation of ace2 expression was also found in the kidneys of pregnant rats 32 these results suggested that pregnant women infected with sars-cov-2 should be watched for severe complications and rapid progression according to the data which collected 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 from 552 hospitals in mainland china the average age of the severe patients n  173 was significantly older than the non-severe ones n  926 by seven years 8 among the critically ill covid-19 patients the non-survivors 646 years were older than the survivors 519 years 9 these data indicated that aging might be correlated with the pathological progression and poor prognosis of covid-19 results obtained from the genetic knockout mice model demonstrated that ace2 depletion caused physiological early aging independent of ang 1-7 indicating the regulatory role of ace2 in aging 33 ace2 expression in the lungs may decrease during aging according to the results in aged rats 34 in humans the ace2 activity did not differ from the young and aged males but showed significant difference in the young and aged females 2930 this finding indicated that the effect of aging in ace2 activity might have a gender difference 2930 in a study that included 220 healthy chinese volunteers young chinese females showed significantly higher ace2 activity than aged females 30 however the activity of ace2 in women during aging is controversial as a spanish group reported lower ace2 activity in the young females comparing to the aged females 29 such controversy may due to sample number-induced deviation or race which requires further validation and investigation although children of all ages were susceptible to covid-19 accumulating clinical data indicated lower infection rates and better clinical outcomes in children compared with adults 78 recently a retrospective study analyzed clinical data from 2135 pediatric cases with covid-19 and found that over 90  of these pediatric patients were asymptomatic mild or moderate cases 35 although there currently lacks an explanation to this phenomenon the authors speculated a potential implication of ace2 35 results in the animal studies implied that ace2 expression in adults might be higher than that in children sheep could be used as an animal model for studying the development of ras 36 the expression of ace2 was significantly lower in the neonatal sheep comparing to that in the adult ones 36 this finding seems to indicate that lower ace2 expression might be correlated with the lower susceptibility of children to sars-cov-2 however the expression and activity of ace2 during the development of human children and teenagers are largely unclear 35 according to the latest study on covid-19 126  were current smokers 1371085 and these patients are more severe than never-smokers as indicated by the severe rate smoker 212  29137 vs never-smoker 145  134927 8 these data suggested that cigarette smoking may affect the pathogenesis and progression of covid-19 the ace2 content in the blood of healthy male volunteers was decreased by long term smoking experience 37 the effect of cigarette smoking may attribute to nicotine which could suppress the activity of the ace2ang 1-7mas receptor axis and upregulate the aceang iiang ii type 1 receptor 38 the decreased ace2 level is accompanied by the imbalance of aceace2 and hence the disturbance in ras homeostasis animal experiments have demonstrated that downregulation of ace2 contributes to the pathogenesis of cigarette smoking-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension pah 39 the expression and activity of ace2 may be promptly modulated by diets especially the salt glucose and fat high salt diet increased activity of ace2 in the urine in mice while low salt intake decreased it 40 the activity of ace2 in the urine may reflect the ace2 in the kidneys 40 indeed it has been found that high salt diet increased the aceace2 ratio in the glomeruli which resulted in renal dysfunction via inducing oxidative stress 41 ace2 was also implicated in the hypertension whose pathogenesis was closely correlated with high salt intake high salt intake increased the prevalence of hypertension in human with ace2 rs2285666 tt and rs714205 gg genes 42 in the spontaneous hypertension rat model high salt diet profoundly worsened the symptoms of hypertension and impaired kidneys via decreasing ace2 43 high glucose diet could also up-regulate ace and down-regulate ace2 leading to the imbalance of aceace2 in the heart 44 strikingly the effect of diet could affect the offspring animal experiments using high salt diet-fed pregnant sheep revealed that the suppress effect of high salt diet on ace2 may affect the embryo and last post natal 45 western diet could decrease the methylation of ace2 gene in the kidneys and brain stem of perinatal mice and resulted in autonomic dysfunctions in the male offspring 46 these findings collectively demonstrated the impact of diet on ace2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases and may even affect the offspring since sars-cov-2 mainly transmits via respiratory droplets and that ace2 is mostly distributed on the at2 cells the lung is the most preliminary target organ for sars-cov-2 infection and pneumonia was the most common complication seen in covid-19 patients with the occurrence of 911  8 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is one of the most severe complications in covid-19 patients with the severity rate ranged from 73  to 92  81747 ace2 has well-established protective effects in the lungs 2 ace2 polymorphism was correlated with the severity of ards 2 ace2 knockout mice showed severe ards-like injury pathology in the lungs comparing to the wild type controls 48 these symptoms can be alleviated by treatment of catalytically active but not enzymatically inactive recombinant ace2 race2 protein 48 moreover ace2 was also protective of sars-infection induced acute lung disease 49 the expression of ace2 in the lungs of mice infected with sars-cov was greatly reduced which aggravated the lung failure 49 these results convincingly proved that ace2 is protective against lung injury and may be a therapeutic target for ards shown in covid-19 ace2 mrna expression decreased in the lungs of copd rats model comparing to controls 50 the reduction of ace2 in the copd lungs revealed the dysregulation of ras which may attribute to the up-regulation of et-1 because et-1 increased in the sputum and serum samples of copd patients 51 and et-1 dose- and time-dependently decreased the expression and activity of ace2 in the cell culture of human bronchial epithelial cells 52 recent data showed that covid-19 patients with copd as coexisting disorder were more likely to progress into severe cases 8 which may partially attribute to the decrease in ace2 many pulmonary diseases such as copd are accompanied by hypoxia 53 in the early phase of hypoxia ace2 expression was profoundly elevated in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells later with the elevation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 hif-1 the expression of ace the target gene of hif-1 increased accompanied by decrease of ace2 54 animal experiments demonstrated that similar regulation by hif-1 on ace2 level possibly via mirna let-7b after hypoxia in rats 55 these results indicated that hypoxia and the cellular adaptation to hypoxia could profoundly induce the fluctuation of ace2 in the lungs ras dysregulation is primarily implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of hypertension 56 being the negative regulator of ras ace2 decreases the blood pressure in animal models of hypertension 2 a decrease of ace2 has been reported in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pah 57 similarly ace2 was also decreased in the blood vessel the kidneys and the brain in the hypertension models 5859 since ace2 was protective of tissue injuries in the lungs 48 and heart 60 these results suggested that covid-19 patients with hypertension may be more likely to develop complications and progress into severe cases indeed data in table 1 showed that covid-19 patients with hypertension have a high severity rate 8 besides severe cases of covid-19 have significantly higher systolic pressure comparing to the non-severe cases 145 mmhg vs 122 mmhg 47 this phenomenon may due to the deprivation of ace2 by the sars-cov-2 leading to a drastic decrease of ace2 ace2 is enriched in heart and is known as an essential regulator of heart function 60 suggesting heart may be one of the primary target organs of sars-cov-2 infection patients infected with sars-cov-2 were at higher risk of progressing into severe cases when having coronal heart disease as comorbidity 817 acute cardiac injury is one of the most common complications found in covid-19 patients 1747 according to a retrospective study published in the lancet that included 41 covid-19 patients 12  developed acute cardiac injury 80  of these cases were diagnosed as severe cases 47 therefore coronal heart disease in the covid-19 patients was closely watched both as baseline comorbidity and as complications the pathogenesis and progression of cardiac injury were one of the preliminary factors that determined the clinical outcomes and prognosis of covid-19 patients 1747 the cardiac injury found in covid-19 patients may be at least partially attributed to the fluctuation of ace2 in the rat model of myocardial infarction the infarcted and peri-infarcted regions showed increased ace2 expression comparing to surviving myocardial tissue after three days of infarction 61 after 28 days of infarction the surviving tissue also showed elevated ace2 expression comparing to normal control 61 the up-regulation of ace2 in the heart after myocardial infarction may be triggered by a compensatory protective mechanism 62 however in the lungs of patients with pah the ace2 expression and phosphorylation were drastically decreased 57 therefore the pulmonary function of covid-19 may progressively deteriorate upon the occurrence of cardiac complications the kidneys may be a major target organ of sars-cov-2 infection because laboratory examinations demonstrated that the urine samples from some covid-19 patients were found positive for the virus 8 acute kidney injury is one of the most severe complications in covid-19 patients as sars-cov-2 may infect the renal intrinsic cells such as proximal tubular epithelial cells and directly induce renal dysfunction the occurrence of acute kidney injury as a complication of covid-19 was 7  in 41 cases reported in the lancet and all of them developed into severe cases 47 in a cohort of 1099 covid-19 patients the occurrence of acute kidney injury was 05  and the severity rate was 833  8 in a consecutive cohort study that included 701 covid-19 patients renal dysfunction characterized as elevation in serum creatine blood urea nitrogen the appearance of proteinuria or hematuria showed a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with normal renal function 63 renal dysfunction was an independent risk factor of mortality in hospitalized patients 63 these studies demonstrated that acute kidney injury was one of the most critical complications that occurred in covid-19 patients ace2 is enriched in the kidneys 2 the activity of ace2 in the renal cortex is even higher than that in the heart 2 the expression level of ace2 decreased both in the acute kidney injury 64 and in several models of chronic kidney disease induced by hypertension diabetes and nephrectomy 65 which disrupted the homeostasis of ras in the kidneys and worsened the pathological changes in the kidneys 265 accumulating evidence has also demonstrated that ace2 played a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of renal diseases as reviewed in 65 ace2 knockout could worsen renal dysfunction modeled in ischemiareperfusion 64 and aggravate the fibrotic pathologies in obstructive renal diseases 66 further investigation in the implication of ace2 in the renal dysfunction occurred in the covid-19 patients and in the clinical outcome in the covid-19 patients with chronic kidney diseases as comorbidity is required ace2 modulates the expression of neutral amino acid transporters on the cell surface of epithelial cells including the insulin secretion pancreatic -cells andor growth of pancreatic islet cells 2 ace2 knockout mice showed impairments in the islet dysfunction and abnormality in glucose tolerance 67 the diabetic mice model infected with an adenovirus expressing human ace2 showed an increase in the production of insulin and a reduction in cellular apoptosis in the pancreatic islet 68 moreover ace2 could improve the endothelial function in the pancreatic islet microvascular unit 69 these findings demonstrated that ace2 prevented pancreatic dysfunction in diabetes ace2 was implicated in the diabetic nephrology in the human kidneys with diabetic nephropathy ace2 was profoundly suppressed while ace was increased 70 the ratio of aceace2 was positively correlated with the systolic pressure the fasting blood glucose level serum creatine and proteinuria in the patients 70 race2 showed promising prevention against diabetic nephrology 2 covid-19 patients with diabetes as coexisting disorders had a worse clinical outcome these phenomena may partially attribute to the deprivation of ace2 by sars-cov-2 infection sars-cov-2 binds with ace2 to enter the host cells leading to the systematic deprivation of ace2 race2 has shown a therapeutic effect in pulmonary injury 48 diabetic nephrology and hypertension 2 recently it was found that a human recombinant soluble ace2 hrsace2 which has already been tested in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials effectively reduced the recovery of sars-cov-2 from vero cells and prevented the infection of sars-cov-2 in engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids 71 this progress suggested the therapeutic potential of hrsace2 in covid-19 since ace2 activation has demonstrated a protective effect on pulmonary injury including ards developing ace2 activator as a potential therapy may be a promising approach against covid-19 diminazene aceturate 72 resorcinolnaphthalein and xanthenone 73 were found to activate ace2 in a drug screening test which showed potential as a candidate therapy for covid-19 acei and arb are commonly-used treatments for hypertension the safety and effect of using these drugs on covid-19 patients with hypertension are still unclear animal experiments revealed that these drugs might decrease the systolic pressure in normal rats and up-regulate ace2 74 since the ace2 expression is suppressed in hypertension 56 and may be further deprived by sars-cov-2 virus upon infection the application of arb may be protective for the pulmonary injury under careful blood pressure management ace2 is currently under intensive investigation as it is the receptor of sars-cov-2 the novel coronavirus that causes covid-19 pandemic we summarized the increasingly emerging findings in the covid-19 and discussed the potential role of ace2 in the pathogenesis progression and prognosis of covid-19 the susceptibility of sars-cov-2 in different cohorts seemed to correlate with the ace2 level the distribution of target organs that are susceptible to the sars-cov-2 infection and complications of covid-19 is similar to the one of ace2 the three functions of ace2 which are a peptidase that negatively modulates ras a regulator for the amino acid transport in the kidneys and a receptor for the virus including sars-cov-2 and sars-cov together with the local protective effect on the tissue injury are implicated in the progression and prognosis of covid-19 these findings indicated that targeting ace2 by using hrsace2 or ace2 activator may be a potential therapeutic strategy for covid-19 prescription of drugs that may affect ace2 such as acei and arb in covid-19 patients requires close observation of the blood pressure and the progression of covid-19 the authors declare that they have

covid-19 patient over activation of t cells lead to the severe immune injury 24 severe covid-19 patients had higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines than non-severe patients suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity 6 we hypothesized that chronic inflammation in glmd patients seems to be more activated than in other patients after covid-19 infection cause cytokine storm with hyperinduction of proinflammatory cytokine production 25  or the cytokine storm caused by covid-19 may lead to exacerbation of glmd we suggest that a comprehensive analysis of glmd patients with covid-19 that is not limited to assess hypertension diabetes and coronary heart disease but also obesity dyslipidemia atherosclerosis and other metabolic disorders etc multi-target therapy will help regulate dysfunction of neuronal-endocrine-immune system which will improve the severity of covid-19 disease it should be acknowledged that the limitations of this meta-analysis may exist in the following points first we have included a total of 9 studies a total of 386 severe patients 1550 non-severe patients which is limited to improve the accuracy of the results only large samples and high-quality research can truly and accurately reflect the correlation between hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease and the severity of covid-19 second due to the relatively small number of eligible studies it is not possible to perform subgroup analysis on the type of severity in addition most of the literature does not carry out correlation studies on disease severity time and outcome so corresponding subgroup analysis cannot be performed this may also affect its accuracy third there are many factors that affect the severity of covid-19 disease in addition hypertension diabetes and coronary heart disease it is also related to various factors such as age other diseases living environment economic and health conditions smoking viral virulence and compliance most of the included literature is unable to control all factors which may also affect our results finally as with all meta-analysis most gray literature is rarely published and the impact of publication bias on the results of this study cannot be completely ruled out yyc and jg designed the study yyc and xg undertook review activities including searches study selection data extraction

chen chen   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a newly recognized infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 since the outbreak in december 2019 it spreaded rapidly and eventually caused an ongoing worldwide pandemic according to the world health organization who as of june 22 2020 sars-cov-2 has infected over 8000000 people and resulted in more than 460000 deaths the lack of effective anti-viral therapy and rapid emergence of covid-19 have placed frontline physicians in a difficult position of battling an unknown disease with unproven conventional therapies thus it is important to fully and correctly understand covid-19 pathophysiology to effectively treat patients in order to minimize morbidity and mortality published literature indicates that the highest risk of death is in patients with previous heart disease and other cardiovascular comorbidities de rosa et al 2020 renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas inhibitors which include angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor type 1 blockers arbs are widely used for treatment of hypertension heart failure and coronary heart disease sars-cov-2 can bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a receptor to facilitate cell fusion and entry which suggests a direct interaction between sars-cov-2 and the raas which may compromise normal raas function hypertension in patients who develop covid-19 is a common occurrence in a study including 1099 confirmed covid-19 patients from 552 hospitals in china 237 of these patients had hypertension guan et al 2020 in another study cerebrovascular disease was observed in 22 of 32 non-survivors from 52 patients in the intensive care unit yang et al 2020b additionally zhang et al reported that hypertension was the most common comorbidity of severe covid-19 patients present in 30 of the hospitalized individuals zhang et al 2020a ace inhibitors and arbs are first-line treatments for patients with hypertension a recent review demonstrated that application of ace inhibitors or arbs could significantly upregulate ace2 expression and enhance its activity thus raising a valid concern that these treatments may facilitate the infectivity of sars-cov-2 south diz  chappell 2020 in addition ace inhibitors can lead to increased activation of the kallikrein-bradykinin system elevated bradykinin expression can induce airway hyperresponsiveness and pulmonary edema which could potentially lead to the deterioration of covid-19 patients aztatzi-aguilar uribe-ramirez arias-montano barbier  de vizcaya-ruiz 2015 cao et al 2020 based on these concerns some researchers have suggested that ace inhibitors and arbs should be discontinued in covid-19 patients with hypertension diaz 2020 esler  esler 2020 fang karakiulakis  roth 2020 conversely covid-19 can induce severe cardiac injury shi et al 2020a which would benefit from the treatment with raas inhibitors covid-19-induced cytokine storm and increased raas activation might enhance the inflammation in the lungs and other organs c chen li hang  wang 2020b romero orias  weir 2015 therefore there is an urgent need to develop guidelines for the use of these drugs during sars-cov-2 infection in this review we discuss the effects of ace inhibitors on bradykinin-induced signaling in the cardiovascular system the roles of raas activation in the covid-19 induced cytokine storm and lung inflammation and examine recent clinical outcomes observed with raas inhibitors in covid-19 patients human covs hcovs belong to the coronavirinae subfamily that are classified into 4 phylogenic clusters    and  covs zhang et al 2018 among all covs 7 prominant strains from the  and  subgroups can infect humans madjid safavi-naeini solomon  vardeny 2020 of these 7 human-infectious covs 4 hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e cause self-resolving upper respiratory tract infections that are the

mild symptoms but can cause organ damage in some individuals for example giacomo et al reported that hcov-oc43 triggered fulminant myocarditis in a 51-year-old woman veronese et al 2020 three covs sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and sars-cov-2 lead to severe respiratory and systematic diseases termed sars mers and covid-19 respectively sars-cov emerged in guangdong province in china in 2002 the mers-cov epidemic began in saudi arabia in 2012 and sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan china in 2019 de wit van doremalen falzarano  munster 2016 while these three viruses can induce respriratory distress they each have distinctive properties table 1

 chan et al 2020 the 3-terminus of the genome contains the four major structural proteins and eight accessory proteins 3a 3b p6 7a 7b 8b 9b andor f14 although sars-cov-2 is closely related to sars-cov there are some notable differences between the two strains for example the 8a protein is absent in sars-cov-2 while present in sars-cov the 8b protein in sars-cov-2 is 121 amino acids compared with 84 amino acids in sars-cov protein 3b is much shorter in sars-cov-2 22 amino acids than in sars-cov 154 amino acids wu et al 2020 it remains unclear the extent to which these differences alter virulence or mortality both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 binds to the same surface protein ace2 while mers-cov enters host cells via binding to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 petrosillo et al 2020 relative to the sars-cov spike protein the sars-cov-2 spike protein contains several amino acid changes which increase salt bridge formation and hydrophobic interactions and strengthen ace2 binding gheblawi et al 2020 these changes may contribute to virulence and the considerably larger global spread of sars-cov-2 compared to sars-cov gheblawi et al 2020 ace2 is a transmembrane protein that plays a central role in down- regulation of raas gheblawi et al 2020 when co-expressed with transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 ace2 acts as receptor for sars-cov-2 cell entry guzik et al 2020 ace2 expression is considerably reduced after sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection jung choi you  kim 2020 interaction between ace2 and the receptor binding domain rbd of the s1 subunit on the viral spike protein facilitates virus entrance endocytosis of sars-cov-2 along with ace2 into endosomes reduces surface ace2 expression k wang gheblawi  oudit 2020a viral entry of sars-cov-2 subsequently upregulates adam metallopeptidase domain 17 adam-17 which mediates ectodomain shedding of ace2 patel et al 2014 adam-17 activation also mediates liberation of membrane bound cytokine precursors including il-4 and ifn- which repress ace2 mrna expression wang gheblawi  oudit 2020a sars-cov-2 activation of raas combined with reduced ace2-mediated conversion of angiotensin ii ang ii to ang-17 results in increased angii accumulation ang ii activates the angiotensin receptor type 1 receptor at1r to trigger a signaling cascade whereby activation of erkp38 map kinase signaling results in upregulation of adam-17 to initiate a positive feedback loop that limits ace2 expression patel et al 2014 in addition inflammation-induced lung injury leads to apoptosis of clara cells and type ii alveolar epithelial cells which are major ace2-expressing cell subsets reduced survival of these cells also contributes to the down-regulation of ace2 fig 2
 wiener cao hinds ramirez  williams 2007 clinical outcomes in covid-19 patients are strongly associated with the pre-existing health status of infected patients cvd comorbidities increase mortality of patients with covid-19 shahid et al 2020 cvd comorbidities have direct consequences upon sars-cov2 infection for example patients with abnormally high blood pressure may exhibit increased apoptosis not only in the heart but also in the kidney which may be exacerbated by the additional stress of sars-cov2 infection gonzalez et al 2003 hamet et al 1995 over the course of severe covid-19 biomarkers indicating heart injury become elevated mehta et al 2020 shi et al 2020b in a washington state case series of 21 critically ill covid-19 patients 7 patients 33 developed cardiomyopathy and 4 19 developed acute renal injury arentz et al 2020 ace2 expression in human heart might be one potential mechanism underlying heart injury during infection with sars-cov-2 however sars-cov-2 infection-induced cytokine storm may also contribute to cardiovascular injury chen li chen feng  xiong 2020a tissue kallikrein produces kinin and bradykinin peptides by cleaving its substrate kininogen in addition to its role in production of angiotensin ii ace mediates bradykinin degradation thus both kinin and bradykinin are increased with use of ace inhibitors fig 3
 increased bradykinin levels are believed to be responsible for the dry cough adverse effect observed in some patients on ace inhibitors moreover kinin and bradykinin peptides can also participate in shock and respiratory allergy thus well-known side effects suggest that ace inhibitors may aggravate lung inflammation and cause lung dysfunction during covid-19 despite the potential adverse effect of dry cough on respiratory tract the kallikreinkinin system kks has many positive functions which may ameliorate cvd fig 3 in experimental models the expression of human tissue kallikrein caused significant reduction of blood pressure in fructose-induced hypertension rats but did not affect blood pressure of non-fructose-fed normal rats yao yin shen chao  chao 2007 accumulating evidence indicates that the kks is capable of exerting organ protection apart from its blood pressure-lowing effect an in vivo study showed that the infusion of kinin improved renal function of hypertensive rats and lowered the corresponding increase in capase-3 activity chao et al 2007 recombinant adeno-associated virus raav mediated human tissue kallikrein exerted a protective effect on myocardial apoptosis in spontaneous hypertensive rats shrs specifically by modulating the activity of caspase-3 through the b2 receptor yan wang  wang 2009 tissue kallikrein not only reduced blood pressure but also attenuated remodeling of the myocardium large blood vessels and kidney wang et al 2004 in addition tissue kallikrein efficiently protected against diabetic nephropathy and chronic renal failure tu et al 2008 yuan et al 2007 zhao et al 2003 it has also been suggested that tissue kallikrein prevents apoptosis and ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction yao et al 2007 in summary bradykinin may improve blood pressure regulation and provide organ protection in hypertensive patients since organ injury often determines mortality in hypertensive patients infected with sars-cov-2 we hypothesize that the by product of increased bradykinin levels induced by ace inhibition may provide more benefit than harm in cvd-comorbid covid-19 patients many studies have demonstrated that ang ii-induced hypertension and the accompanying vascular inflammation result in organ damage chen et al 2017 chen et al 2019 gonzalez et al 2015 yang et al 2018 il-6 plays an important role in mediating heart damage genetic disruption of il6 markedly attenuates the cardiac injury and inflammation induced by ang ii which suggests that il-6 acts downstream of the ang ii effector chen et al 2017 chen et al 2019 gonzalez et al 2015 yang et al 2018 ang ii also induces the production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-1 guo et al 2011 several studies suggest that ang ii not only acts as a vasoactive peptide that regulates blood pressure but also works as an inflammatory cytokine causing cardiovascular remodeling gibbons pratt  dzau 1992 griendling minieri ollerenshaw  alexander 1994 sadoshima  izumo 1993 during the immune response activated by sars-cov-2 a cytokine storm is often observed in severe cases serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6 il-2r and il-1 are elevated huang et al 2020 qin et al 2020 xu et al 2020 increased markers of this cytokine storm such as serum il-6 predict poor outcome in patients with severe covid-19 cao 2020 covid-19 patients also have elevated ang ii levels which are positively associated to viral load and lung injury liu et al 2020 thus sars-cov-2 infection dysregulates ang ii over-activates the immune response and augments the cytokine storm that causes organ damage the inhibition or the blockage of raas may be helpful to attenuate the inflammatory storm and prevent end-organ damage ace2 plays an important role in the regulation of angiotensin signaling the generation of ang ii is well understood liver-derived angiotensinogen atg is cleaved by renin into ang i which is further processed by ace to ang ii and is converted by ace2 into ang-17 ang-17 is generally considered cvd-protective it counters the action of ang ii through a g protein-coupled receptor grcr mas previous studies demonstrated that both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov which caused the sars epidemic in 2003 spike proteins s proteins bind to the extracellular domain of ace2 sars-cov-2 uses ace2 abundantly expressed in pulmonary epithelium kidney and heart for intracellular entry fig 3 after infection by sars-cov-2 ace2 expression is reduced crackower et al 2002 imai et al 2005 kuba et al 2005 animal models of infection with sars-cov showed that ace2 downregulation resulted in pro-inflammatory responses including lung injury and cardiac contractility impairment crackower et al 2002 imai et al 2005 kuba et al 2005 if sars-cov-2 infections progress similarly to sars-cov the virus may deteriorate a patients condition via two mechanisms first lower ace2 expression decreases the degradation of ang ii overabundance of ang ii has multiple deleterious cardiovascular consequences including elevating blood pressure cardiomyocyte apoptosis cardiac infiltration by macrophages and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines second less ace2 reduces the formation ang-17 and its cvd-protective vasodilatory anti-inflammatory anti-fibrillatory and anti-proliferatory effects lelis freitas machado crespo  santos 2019 patel zhong grant  oudit 2016 in particular ang-17 can diminish il-6 tnf- macrophage infiltration vascular cell adhesion protein 1 vcam-1 and increase nitric oxide release together these effects increase the survival of cardiomyocytes during inflammation simoese silva silveira ferreira  teixeira 2013 moreover ang-17 promotes resolution of vascular inflammation in vivo by decreasing vcam-1 il-6 and mcp-1 zhang et al 2015 decreased levels of ace2 may lead to a deficiency of ang-17 production and contribute to tissue damage in covid-19 although ace inhibitors and arbs do not directly affect ace2 they can indirectly lead to increased ace2 activity and ang-17 expression hanff harhay brown cohen  mohareb 2020 a study by ferrario and co-workers showed that ace inhibitor caused a 25-fold rise of plasma ang-17 concentrations and an approximately 25 increase of ace2 expression in the left ventricle ferrario et al 2005 thus the usage of ace inhibitors and arbs may have a potential benefit in preventing covid-19-triggered organ damage via its upregulation of ang-17 and depletion of ang ii in conclusion dysregulation of raas due to increased ang ii and decreased ace2 can lead to a harmful inflammatory response and worsening of elevated blood pressure ace inhibitors and arbs may have a potential role in preventing the harmful effects by directly countering ang ii and upregulating ace2 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is a common and devastating development in patients with covid-19 ards is characterized by high permeability pulmonary edema severe hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress wosten-van asperen et al 2011 diffuse alveolar damage and an acute inflammation response characterized by high vascular permeability increased vascular tone and fibroblast activation play a central role in ards pathophysiology marshall et al 2002 local raas signaling occurs in the lung as lung fibroblasts alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells are capable of synthesizing raas components wosten-van asperen et al 2011 considerable evidence suggests that dysregulation of raas and increased ang ii levels induce ards symptoms including hypoxemia vasoplegia and ventilationperfusion ratio vq mismatching evans mccurdy weiner zaku  chow 2019 guazzi melzi marenzi  agostoni 1999 kaparianos  argyropoulou 2011 previous findings suggest that increased ace expression or activity may exacerbate inflammation in subjects with covid-19 pulmonary capillary beds are a large reservoir of endothelial-bound ace orfanos et al 2000 ace activity is considerably elevated in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf of patients with ards idell et al 1987 a polymorphic insert that reduces ace expression and activity is associated with reduced ards severity marshall et al 2002 ace expression activates macrophage function and stimulates interleukin il formation shen et al 2007 covid-19 is associated with an increased proportion of mononuclear phagocytes which are regulated by the raas merad  martin 2020 in addition alveolar macrophages are associated with tissue repair and fibrosis generation in covid-19 patients ramachandran et al 2019 lastly ace inhibitors decrease oxygen free radical production generated by lung alveolar macrophages suzuki et al 1999 since ace is detectable in the entire alveolar capillary network of human lung conversion from ang i to ang ii can rapidly occur in the pulmonary circulation metzger franke bohle alhenc-gelas  danilov 2011 excessive ang ii can lead to significant effects during covid-19-induced ards through several mechanisms ang ii-induced vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circulation can cause low blood flow vq mismatching and hypoxemia zhang  baker 2017 ang ii-induced vascular permeability and vasoconstriction can result in pulmonary edema yamamoto et al 1997 ang ii can also induce endothelial expression of il-8 e-selectin p-selectin cc-chemokine ligand-5 ccl5 and ccl2 which increase pulmonary leukocyte recruitment and retention bernstein et al 2018 moreover ang ii induces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph oxidase in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells to increase reactive oxygen species ros and cause vascular injury bernstein et al 2018 in addition ang ii reduces alveolar epithelial cell survival by accelerating cellular apoptosis with an ec50 of just 10 nm wang et al 1999 epithelial apoptosis is linked to subsequent fibrotic responses shetty et al 2017 prolonged hyperinflammation in ards or covid-19 can cause progressive tissue damage unchecked inflammation can induce a state of dysregulated tissue repair and lung fibrosis lung fibrosis thickens alveolar walls reduces lung compliance obliterates alveolar air spaces and impairs gas exchange ang ii is implicated in tissue repair or when in excess lung fibrosis uhal li piasecki  molina-molina 2012 acting through the angiotensin ii receptor type 1 at1r ang ii activates p38 and p4244 mapk induces dna synthesis and fibroblast proliferation konigshoff et al 2007 marshall mcanulty  laurent 2000a marshall puddicombe cookson  laurent 2000b furthermore ang ii activates fibroblasts synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix ecm including type i collagen that thickens alveolar walls and reduces lung compliance uhal et al 2012 finally during the severe ards or covid-19 patients often suffer from septic shock prolonged ang ii signaling induces at1r phosphorylation and desensitization which is a major cause of the vascular hyporesponsiveness that leads to pulmonary vasoplegia levy et al 2018 together this data suggests that ang ii may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatement many vascular pathophysiologies of covid-19 ace2 is an indispensable regulator in the raas that counteracts ace and ang ii lower ace2 has deleterious cardiovascular consequences and also worsens lung functional decline compared to wt mice ace2-deficient mice had impaired lung function and higher mortality in sepsis-induced lung injury imai et al 2005 severe lung failure in ace2-deficient mice could be rescued by inactivation of ace and at1r blockage imai et al 2005 arbs can prevent downregulation of ace2 during lps-induced ards suggesting that raas inhibitors may also protect against lung damage in patients with sars wosten-van asperen et al 2011 furthermore downregulation of ace2 can lead to elevated activation of ace and ang ii li et al 2008 simoese silva et al 2013 which can exacerbate the physiological progression of ards in covid-19 thus despite acting as the receptor for sars-cov-2 ace2 activity is likely protective during covid-19 disease progression in conclusion elevation of ace and ang ii and down-regulation of ace2 can exacerbate sars-cov-2 induced ards drugs that target ace and ang ii ace inhibitors and arbs may play an important role in abrogating the inflammatory response vasoconstriction and vq mismatching that causes clinical deterioration in patients with covid-19 animal models and clinical experience suggest both beneficial and deleterious effects of ace inhibitors and arbs in patients suffering from covid-19 this uncertainty raises concerns regarding the overall effect of raas inhibitors after sars-cov-2 infection sriram  insel 2020 such concerns should not be ignored examination of clinical outcomes of raas inhibitor application in covid-19 patients should be a top priority zhou et al 2013 accumulated clinical data demonstrates that hypertension is associated with higher mortality in patients with covid-19 sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers wang et al 2020b zhou et al 2020 guidance on management of high blood pressure is required for this special situation a jointly published statement by american heart association aha the american college of cardiology acc and the heart failure society of america strongly recommended continuation of ace inhibitorarbs zhang zhu et al 2020b although we have illustrated that ace inhibitorsarbs can theoretically benefit covid-19 patients with hypertension further evidence regarding the effect of ace inhibitorarb usage is indispensable several clinical studies based on the application raas inhibitors in covid-19 patients with hypertension were carried out in the past few months table 2
 a large-scale study included 1128 hospitalized patients with hypertension and covid-19 infection from nine hospitals in hubei province china zhang dong et al 2020a during the 28-day follow up all-cause mortality of patients in the ace inhibitorarb group was significantly lower than in the non-ace inhibitorarb group 37 7188 versus 98 92940 in addition incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation 00 in ace inhibitorarb group versus 23 in non-ace inhibitorarbs group and septic shock 32 in ace inhibitorarb group versus 80 in non-ace inhibitorarb group were also lower the findings in this multi-center retrospective cohort study provide compelling evidence for potential beneficial effects in ace inhibitors and arbs and supports continuous usage of these drugs in hypertensive covid-19 patients a more recent retrospective study by yang et al in april 2020 reported similar observations yang et al 2020a hypertensive covid-19 patients using ace inhibitorsarbs had lower proportion of critically ill patients 93 versus 229 and mortality rate 47 versus 133 than hypertensive covid-19 patients that were not on ace inhibitorsarbs jung et al reported a nationwide cohort study on the use of raas inhibitors in covid-19-related outcomes in south korea jung et al 2020 among the 5179 confirmed sars-cov-2 patients raas inhibitor use did not alter mortality adjusted or 088 95 ci 053144 p  60 jung et al 2020 among hospitalized covid-19 patients with hypertension in-hospital mortality was lower 9 in patients given raas inhibitors than those not treated with raas inhibitors 13 although this difference was not statisticaly significant p  14 jung et al 2020 multivariate analysis that adjusted for baseline co-morbidities revealed no independent association between raas inhibitor use and risk mortality among hypertensive covid-19 patients adjusted or 071 95 ci 040126 p  25 jung et al 2020 similarly mancia et al retrospectively examined 6272 patients and found no association between raas inhibitor use and susceptibility or evolution of covid-19 mancia rea ludergnani apolone  corrao 2020 adjusted or for risk of sars-cov-2 infection was 096 95 ci 087107 for ace inhibitors and 095 95 ci 086105 for arbs while the risk of severe covid-19 or death was 091 95 ci 069 to 121 for ace inhibitors and 083 95 ci 063 to 110 for arbs mancia et al 2020 these data suggest that treatment with ace inhibitorsarbs did not increase the likelihood of sars-cov-2 infection or the risk of death in patients with covid-19 gao et al retrospectively analyzed 850 hospitalized covid-19 patients with hypertension and found no significant difference in mortality between raas inhibitor-treated 183 patients 22 mortality and non-raas inhibitor-treated subjects 527 patients 36 mortality p  774 gao et al 2020 further meta-analysis including three additional studies in china revealed a lower risk of mortality associated with raas inhibitor treated vs non-raas inhibitor treated hypertensive patients relative risk 065 95 ci 045094 p  02 gao et al 2020 while these studies suggest a potential protective effect of raas inhibitors in treatment of covid-19 patients we should interpret them with extreme caution like all retrospective studies these studies are limited by sample selection biases the pool of raas inhibitor-treated patients likely have multiple or more severe co-morbidities and might be expected to have worse outcomes than non-raas-inhibitor-treated patients confounding factors may also contribute to reduced hospitalization or mortality for example raas inhibitor-treated subjects may seek more routine or intensive medical care or have heightened awareness that leads to more diligent hygiene andor social distancing in addition these findings may not replicate in other populations geographically and ethnically diverse cohorts and randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to better understand the specific effect of raas inhibitors in covid-19 patients two recent studies suggest the interesting finding that while ace inhibitors might reduce covid-19 morbidity arbs have a less pronounced effect khera et al reported that of 2263 hypertensive sars-cov-2 patients those treated with ace inhibitors were 40 less likely to be hospitalized than those not treated with ace inhibitors while there was no reduction in hospitalization in patients treated with arbs khera et al 2020 milne et al analyzed gene expression of 1051 lung tissue samples and discovered that ace inhibitor treatment was associated with significantly lower expression of the ace2 co-receptor tmprss2 in contrast tmprss2 expression was not altered in patients treated with arbs milne yang timens bosse  sin 2020 these data provide a potential mechanistic explanation for a protective role of ace inhibitors but not arbs in covid-19 treatment our review of the recent literature suggests potential for protective effects of continued treatment of cvd covid-19 subjects with ace inhibitors andor arbs specifically 1 ace inhibitors attenuate the deterioration of ards in covid-19 patients by limiting both ang ii-dependent and ang ii-independent pro-inflammatory signaling 2 ace inhibitors limit breakdown of bradykinin which attenuates hypertension and prevents ventricular apoptosis and remodeling that worsen after sars-cov-2 infection and 3 ace inhibitors suppress tmprss2 expression which is an essential co-receptor for sars-cov-2 cell entry based on the available evidence of clinical studies and previous animal research we believe that there is no reason to discontinue the use of ace inhibitors or arb drugs in patients with covid-19 and hypertension or other cardiovascular comorbidities this recommendation is in accordance with the major professional societies bavishi maddox  messerli 2020 whether ace inhibitorsarbs provide protection in covid-19 patients without history of cvd remains unknown further studies need to be conducted in order to provide a definite answer this work was supported by grants from the 1013039501100001809national natural science foundation of china 91839302 81630010 and 81790624 and

padda jasmine mangat mohsin altaf   coronavirus disease covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a global pandemic that initially started in wuhan china and spread extremely quickly making its way to over 180 countries as the novel coronavirus continues to evolve there are still many limitations to our knowledge of who exactly this virus would impact critically older adults and people of any age who have underlying medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes have shown worse prognosis 1 diabetic patients have increased morbidity and mortality rates and have been linked to more hospitalization and intensive care unit icu admissions 1 people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd or any respiratory illnesses are also at higher risk for severe illness from covid-19 2 the risk of contracting covid-19 in patients with copd is found to be 4-fold higher than patients without copd 2 a retrospective study of middle-aged and elderly patients with covid-19 found that the elderly population is more susceptible to this illness and is more likely to be admitted to the icu with a higher mortality rate 3 the age-related changes in the geriatric population may be due to the changes in lung anatomy and muscle atrophy which results in changes in physiologic function reduction of lung reserve reduction of airway clearance and reduction of the defense barrier function 3 the clinical outcomes and length of stay directly correlate with the underlying conditions and age of the covid-19 patient researchers in china studied 344 patients in the icu with covid-19 of the 344 subjects 133 patients died on the 28th day with a median survival of 25 days 4 of these patients there were many with different comorbidities with 141 patients having hypertension 4 in survivors the median duration of hospitalization for a negative test result was 12 days 4 furthermore another study conducted in china studied 633 covid-19 patients of whom 247 patients had at least one comorbidity and that concluded that older individuals greater than 60 years were more likely to exhibit a more severe form of covid-19 disease 5 during the study 25 patients with a median age of 693 years died giving an effective mortality rate of 377 5 it has been concluded that the older the patients are the more likely they are to succumb to the covid-19 disease in the usa the centers for disease control and prevention cdc uses covid-net in 14 states to monitor the demographics of covid-19 patients who are being hospitalized 6 from march 1 through 30 2020 there were a total of 180 patients on covid-net of which 893 of the patients had an underlying comorbidity 6 of the 180 patients 944 aged 65 years and older had at least comorbidity 6 the most common comorbidities found were obesity hypertension and diabetes mellitus 6 the purpose of this paper is to review these comorbidities given that most patients with severe covid-19 cases had comorbidity furthermore we would like to examine specific comorbidities in relation to the covid-19 disease progression and outcomes based on the literature report since the outbreak an electronic literature search was performed using pubmed google scholar ebscohost mendeley and medline plus the search was limited to peer-reviewed articles published from january to april 20 2020 an article was selected if it included keywords such as coronavirus covid-19 sars-cov-2 clinical features comorbidity diabetes and hypertension articles were then reviewed and included based on the applicability to the topic confirmed and reported cases of covid-19 have a wide range of symptoms from mild complaints such as fever and cough to more critical cases associated with difficulty in breathing 7 some of the most common symptoms include cough fever chills shortness of breath sob muscle aches sore throat unexplained loss of taste or smell diarrhea and headache 8 symptoms can start as mild and become more intense over 5 to 7 days worsening if pneumonia develops in patients 8 approximately 1 out of 6 infected individuals become seriously ill and develop difficulty in breathing especially in the elderly with underlying health conditions 9 a meta-analysis study of covid-19 patients as depicted in fig 1 showed fever 888 as the most common symptom followed by dry cough 68 and fatigue 33 10 other symptoms noted were productive cough 285 sob 17 muscle pain 144 sore throat 114 and headache 102 10 the least common symptoms were diarrhea 44 nausea and vomiting 41 rhinorrhea 32 abdominal pain 016 and chest pain 011 10 symptoms of covid-19 may appear anytime from 2 to 14 days after exposure therefore 14-day quarantine is recommended 7 the average incubation period for covid-19 is approximately 52 days 11 in wuhan china the most common symptoms observed from the onset of this outbreak include fever cough and fatigue while some features that were not so prevalent were sputum production headache hemoptysis and gastrointestinal gi symptom such as diarrhea 12 13 another study that was conducted in beijing china showed that the average age of patients with covid-19 was 355 years and had a mean of 35 days from the onset of symptoms to admission in the hospital 14 the same study also showed that fever was present in 875 of patients which persisted for 65 days and symptoms resolved 25 days after a negative test result 14 some individuals who are infected do not develop any symptoms at all and about 80 of positive cases recover from the disease without any treatment 9 however there have also been instances of transmissions of covid-19 from one person to another before the person became aware of being sick or the symptoms were so mild that the person did not know heshe had the illness 15 it becomes essential to seek medical attention immediately if a person suspects that heshe may have been infected or is a confirmed case of covid-19 experiencing respiratory distress has blue lips is in constant pain or has pressure in the chest 7 also it is important to note that covid-19 is more infectious than sars-cov and mers-cov due to its numerous epidemiological and biological characteristics 16 due to covid-19 being a relatively new and understudied disease the data available is limited however from the cases that emerged it was observed that comorbidities increase the chances of infection 7 based on current information and clinical expertise the elderly especially those in long-term care facilities and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions are at a greater risk of getting covid-19 7 the elderly a vulnerable population with chronic health conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular or lung disease are not only at a higher risk of developing severe illness but are also at an increased risk of death if they become ill 15 people with underlying uncontrolled medical conditions such as diabetes hypertension lung liver and kidney disease cancer patients on chemotherapy smokers transplant recipients and patients taking steroids chronically are at increased risk of covid-19 infection 7 a meta-analysis study on covid-19 comorbidities as depicted in fig 2 had a total of 1786 patients of which 1044 were male and 742 were female with a mean age of 41 years old 10 the most common comorbidities identified in these patients were hypertension 158 cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions 117 and diabetes 94 10 17 the less common comorbidities were coexisting infection with hiv and hepatitis b 15 malignancy 15 respiratory illnesses 14 renal disorders 08 and immunodeficiencies 001 10 patients with moderate to severe asthma are at a disadvantage because this virus affects their respiratory tracts leading to increased asthmatic attacks pneumonia and acute respiratory distress 7 according to the cdcs morbidity and mortality weekly report 346 of patients aged 18 to 49 years old have an underlying chronic lung disease such as asthma 6 in iran a case study reported that genetic predisposition to covid-19 can increase the probabilities of getting infected with sars-cov-2 and can lead to death from this virus 18 this genetic predisposition was seen in 3 brothers in iran who were 6 years apart in age 54 60 and 66 years who died due to covid-19 despite no identified comorbidities and living separately from one another 18 as of january 2 2020 wuhan china had 41 patients admitted to the hospital who tested positive for covid-19 of which 73 3041 were men with a median age of 49 years old 66 2741 of these patients had been exposed to the huanan market 32 1341 had underlying diseases such as diabetes 20 841 hypertension 15 641 and cardiovascular 15 641 12 patients who are hiv positive along with a low cd4 count and not on antiretroviral therapy have a higher risk and incidence of other medical issues including covid-19 7 according to the international aids society ias people who are human immunodeficiency virus hiv positive taking antiretroviral treatment and do not have a low cd4 count will have the same risk of having covid-19 as one without hiv 19 20 as depicted in fig 3 a population-based surveillance report via covid-19-associated hospitalization surveillance network covid-net reported clinical data on 1478 covid-19-positive patient hospitalizations from march 1 to march 30 2020 6 among the 1478 patients studied 12 of adults showed clinical data of underlying medical conditions with the most prevalent being hypertension 497 and obesity a close second 483 6 other medical conditions included chronic lung disease 346 diabetes mellitus 283 and cardiovascular diseases 278 6 covid-19 can cause severe disease leading to hospitalization in icu and potentially death especially in the elderly with comorbidities 21 according to the cdc 8 out of 10 deaths reported in the usa occurred in adults 65 years old and above 7 roughly 80 of covid-19-positive cases result in full recovery from the illness without any hospitalizations or interventions 9 there are still many facts that we do not know about covid-19 due to gaps in knowledge therefore many studies are underway to better understand this virus 15 wuhan china had 41 patients admitted to the hospital who tested positive for covid-19 from december 16 2019 to january 2 2020 and the clinical outcomes are shown in fig 4 12 of the 41 patients with confirmed covid-19 in the hospital 100 had pneumonia 29 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 15 exhibited an acute cardiac injury and 12 acquired a secondary infection 12 the majority of these patients 68 were discharged 17 remained hospitalized 10 ended up in the icu and 15 ended in death 12 from february 20 to march 5 2020 a study was conducted in evergreen washington on the characteristics and outcomes of 21 critically ill patients with confirmed covid-19 diagnosis 22 this study showed that 71 of these patients required mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory arrest was seen in all of them 22 within 72 h of developing ards 53 of these patients showed increasing severity of respiratory problems leading to poor short-term outcomes and a higher risk of death 22 as of march 17 2020 the mortality rate was 67 in these patients with 24 critically ill and 95 discharged from hospital 22 as shown in the cdcs mortality and morbidity weekly report in fig 5 case mortality increased as the patients age increased 21 23 among the age group  19 years no icu admission or mortality was reported 21 covid-19 has also been noticed in children but the disease took a more moderate course when compared with adults the prognosis was also seemingly better and deaths were infrequent 24 on april 29 2020 who reported over 3 million confirmed covid-19 cases worldwide with over 200000 of these cases resulting in mortality 25 the majority of these deaths are within the usa with over 50000 followed by italy with over 25000 and spain with over 20000 25 new york is being hit the hardest by the novel coronavirus spreading across the usa with more cases and deaths per capita than any other state table 1 reports that over 86 of covid-19 deaths involved at least one comorbidity according to the new york state department of health 26 multiple comorbidities are associated with the severity of covid-19 disease progression many of the poorer outcomes for covid-19 have been related to cardiovascular comorbid conditions 27 however this may be a direct result of the cardiovascular condition itself or attributed to other comorbidities along with a cardiovascular condition 27 patients with type 2 diabetes were also more likely to have increased severity of covid-19 28 in a cohort study of 7337 patients with covid-19 with and without type 2 diabetes it was shown that those with type 2 diabetes required increased interventions for their hospital stay versus those that were nondiabetic 28 it was shown that those with poorer blood glucose control had an all-around increased mortality rate than those with better glucose control 28 the study concluded that patients with blood glucose specifically those in the range of 39 to 100 mmoll had overall decreased composite adverse events and mortality 28 it was noted that poor blood glucose control resulted in a substantially increased risk of complications and death 28 among other comorbidities chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd has also been associated with poor disease progression a meta-analysis of multiple studies in china found that there was a four-fold increase in mortality in patients with preexisting copd that were diagnosed with covid-19 29 in this analysis the smoking status of patients and severity of covid-19 were also studied only one study was found to have an association with smoking and severe course of covid-19 29 after this study was removed there was no significant association with smoking and severe covid-19 disease 29 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure associated with the novel coronavirus may be linked to a prothrombotic coagulopathy 30 the autopsy of covid-19-related deaths revealed dispersed microthrombi in the pulmonary vasculature demonstrating an occlusive etiology of respiratory failure 30 a 38 to 100 improvement was noted in three cases with covid-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and respiratory failure following treatment with intravenous iv antithrombotic alteplase 30 the results although reassuring were transient in two of the three cases with recovery succumbing posttreatment 30 the use of anti-thrombolytic therapy needs to be further studied to ascertain that the results are due to treatment and not chance alone 30 a retrospective meta-analysis including 1558 covid-19 patients was conducted until march 1 2020 on subjects with underlying comorbidities and the risk for acquiring covid-19 31 common comorbidities such as hypertension copd diabetes and cardio-cerebrovascular disease were observed to be the more significant risk factors in subjects when compared with other underlying disease states 31 other than intense supportive measures a definitive treatment has yet to be identified 31 authorities speculate that subjects with comorbidities were linked to a more severe disease outcome when infected with the novel coronavirus when compared with patients with no underlying disease 31 the study was met with barriers due to the diminutive sample size and some subjects having more than one underlying comorbidity 31 in literature and earlier research underlying diseases increase the mortality rate in patients who acquired covid-19 with cardiac disease and diabetes being the most significant risk factors 32 once again insufficient sample size and inadequate time have led to limitations in the data collected 32 over 180 countries have been affected by covid-19 resulting in mass death worldwide as cases evolve globally it has been noted that persons with underlying chronic illnesses are more likely to contract the virus and become severely ill due to sars cov-2 being a relatively new virus the data available is limited however patients with comorbidities have more deteriorating outcomes compared with patients without covid-19 patients with history of hypertension obesity chronic lung disease diabetes and cardiovascular disease have the worst prognosis and most often end up with deteriorating outcomes such as ards and pneumonia also elderly patients in long-term care facilities chronic kidney disease patients and cancer patients are not only at risk for contracting the virus but there is a significantly increased risk of death among these groups of patients of the cases reported worldwide symptoms of covid-19 ranged from mild respiratory disease to severe illness which requires intubation and mechanical ventilation since there is a period where the patient is asymptomatic and the incubation period is between 2 and 14 days it is difficult to establish an early diagnosis much less curb the transmission of the infection if the patient is unknowingly exposed however within this period if respiratory symptoms develop it is important to seek immediate care therefore patients with comorbidities should take all necessary precautions to avoid getting infected with sars cov-2 as they usually have the worst prognosis these precautions include regular handwashing with soap and water or use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer limiting person-to-person contact and practicing social distancing wearing a face mask in public places and overall limiting going to public areas at this time unless it is necessary hence there is a need for a global public health campaign to raise awareness on reducing the burden of these comorbidity illnesses causing deaths in covid-19-infected patients  the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in coronavirusesinfluenza viruses and cardiovascular disease li chen guang hao   the reninangiotensin system ras plays a critical role in maintaining normal cardiovascular cv functions and contributes to a spectrum of cv diseases such as hypertension coronary heart disease myocarditis and congestive heart failure1 generally the ras is composed of angiotensinogen renin angiotensin ii ang ii ang ii receptors at1 and at2 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme ace23 ace is ubiquitously present in many cell types tissues and organs ace is an ectoenzyme that plays a role in the generation of ang ii by catalysing the extracellular conversion of the decapeptide ang i4 in the past two decades a new homologue of the enzyme termed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 was identified and ace2 can convert ang ii to ang1-7 or convert ang i to ang1-956 although ang ii increases blood pressure bp ang1-7 is a vasodilator and the ace2ang1-7 axis has been suggested to act as a natural damping mechanism for the activation of the classical ras7 besides its crucial role in cv disease ace2 has also been considered as a functional potential coronavirus including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 also called 2019-ncov receptor that binds directly to the viral spike protein811 in addition ace2 plays an important role in acute lung injury induced by influenza viruses such as h1n1 h5n1 and h7n91214 suggesting that ace2 still has unexpected facets with clinical implications cv diseases are the most common non-communicable diseases globally15 in addition emerging viral infections also represent a major global public health concern1618 such as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19caused by sars-cov-2 in china19 and 2009 h1n1 in the usa and canada20 ace2 could be a novel therapeutic target for cv diseases and a potential target for the treatment of coronaviruses and influenza viruses the present review is primarily focused on the findings indicating the role of ace2 in the relationship of coronaviruses and influenza viruses to cv disease figure 1
 both influenza viruses and coronaviruses are typically contagious viruses that cause respiratory disease coronaviruses are members of the subfamily coronavirinae in the coronaviridae family and the nidovirales order including four generaalphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus21 coronaviruses cause respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and humans they were not considered to be highly pathogenic to humans until the outbreak of sars in 2003 six human-infecting types of coronaviruses were discovered before 2019 two highly pathogenic viruses sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov cause severe respiratory syndromes in humans and the other four human coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 and hku1 induce only mild upper respiratory tract diseases in immunocompetent hosts152223 in 2019 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 was identified in china and all over the world it has infected 1 300 000 of the population and became a public health emergency declared by the world health organization who so far the pathology of covid-19 pneumonia is still not clear human influenza viruses are members of the orthomyxoviridae family based on the matrix and nucleoprotein genes influenza viruses have been classified as type a b c and d in humans only influenza a and b viruses influenza a and b are of epidemiological and public interest24 although other related viruses influenza c and d viruses may also cause at least subclinical infections in humans15 despite the production of annually designed vaccines and the many improvements in public health surveillance and infrastructure each year in the usa alone seasonal influenza a and b viruses continue to evolve and take the lives of 300048 000 people25 highly transmissible and pathogenic virus outbreaks cause a significant disease burden in terms of morbidity and associated complications and have a huge economic impact112627 meanwhile cv disease is also the leading cause of death and disease burden worldwide15 infection with the virus might be one of the pathogeneses of atherosclerosis and related cv disease atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arteries associated with pro-inflammatory lipid abnormalities28 infectious diseases are suggested to be a causative factor and several viruses have been studied for their relationship to cv diseases1529 influenza can trigger heart attacks and vaccination against influenza reduces the risk of cv events for example influenza infection has long been thought to directly contribute to cv morbidity and mortality30 various influenza viruses are involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis and related cv disease3132 and influenza virus rna has even been found in mouse and human atherosclerotic plaques3334 further acute influenza infection has been shown to accentuate the progression of atherosclerosis and related cv disease35 epidemiological data on the coronavirus and cv disease are scant however it is shown that mers-cov patients have a high prevalence of hypertension and cv disease in mers-cov patients the prevalence of chronic heart disease and hypertension is 15 and 33 respectively36 more recently there are new pieces of evidence which show that the precondition of cv disease may increase the risk of sars-cov-2 infection among 41 admitted hospital patients infected with sars-cov-2 in wuhan 15 had hypertension and 15 had cv disease15 another study included 138 patients infected with sars-cov-2 in wuhan and found that 31 of the patients had hypertension and 15 had cv disease37 in another retrospective study of 99 patients with pneumonia 40 had cv and cerebrovascular diseases38 the association between coronaviruses and cv disease still needs further study ace2 has emerged as a key regulator of the ras39 increasing evidence suggests that ace2 plays a protective role in cv disease and other pathologies40 in atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein e knockout mice ace2 deficiency results in augmented vascular inflammation and the inflammatory response contributes to increased atherosclerotic plaque formation41 in animal studies sarkissian et al found that cardiac overexpression of ace2 exerted a protective influence on the heart during myocardial infarction by preserving cardiac function left ventricular wall motion and contractility42 yamamoto et al reported that ace2 gene knockdown resulted in severe cardiac dysfunction ie reduced contractility increased hypertrophy and dilation43 in addition ace inhibitors and at1 receptor antagonists which have been proven to be beneficial for the treatment of myocardial infarction and heart failure increase ace2 gene expression attenuate ace2 gene down-regulation and normalize at1 receptor expression in the myocardium post-myocardial infarction4446 loss of ace2 enhances adverse remodelling and susceptibility to pressure and volume overload47 human recombinant ace2 suppresses myocardial hypertrophy fibrosis inflammation and bp47 feng et al reported that ace2 overexpression reduced ang ii-induced cardiac hypertrophy partially through a decrease in sympathetic drive in syn-hace2 transgenic mice48 wysocki et al found that during ang ii infusion recombinant human ace2 effectively degraded ang ii and in the process normalized bp49 one of the ace2 activators xanthenone has been demonstrated to decrease bp and improve cardiac function with inhibition of cardiac and renal fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats50 the key role of ace2 in the progressive deterioration of cardiac remodelling and systolic dysfunction has further been found in humans51 circulating ace2 activity increases with increasing vascular tone which suggests that elevated ace2 may be a compensatory response to hypertension15 ohtsuki et al reported that the up-regulation of the ace2 gene in the left ventricular myocardium of patients with severe heart failure was associated with the degree of left ventricular dilatation and may thereby constitute an important adaptive mechanism to retard the progression of adverse left ventricular remodelling15 studies with recombinant human ace2 have shown beneficial cardiac effects4950 human ace2 is an endothelium-bound carboxymonopeptidase with a single active site catalytic region whose expression is limited mainly to endothelial cells of the arteries arterioles and venules in various organs including the heart lungs and kidneys52 loss of ace2 leads to age-dependent cardiomyopathy and kidney disease while also enhancing pulmonary cardiac and renal injuries53 on the other hand ace2 was identified as a functional sars coronavirus receptor8 ace2 and the at2 receptor protect mice from sars coronavirus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome whereas ace ang ii and the at1a receptor promote the impairment of lung function in mouse models954 kuba et al provided the genetic proof that ace2 is a crucial sars-cov receptor in vivo and sars-cov infections and the spike protein of sars-cov reduce ace2 expression9 this study also found that blocking the reninangiotensin pathway can attenuate the worsened acute lung failure induced by the injection of sars-cov spike protein in mice furthermore antibodies directed against ace2 and soluble ace2 molecules and derivatives were demonstrated to be capable of blocking sars-cov infection55 like sars-cov hcov-nl63 also employs ace2 as a receptor for cellular entry56 wevers and hoek found that hcov-nl63 infection induced a reduction of cellular ace2 expression57 tseng et al demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing hace2 were highly susceptible to sars-cov infection resulting in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations including death depending upon the transgenic lineages58 letko and munster first demonstrated that sars-cov-2 used the same cell entry receptor ace2 as sars-cov10 and subsequent studies also confirmed this result155961 in experimental mouse models zou et al found that infection with highly pathogenic avian inuenza a h5n1 virus results in a down-regulation of ace2 expression in the lung and increased serum ang ii levels12 genetic inactivation of ace2 causes severe lung injury in h5n1-challenged mice conrming the role of ace2 in h5n1-induced lung pathologies12 yang et al reported that ace2 could mediate the severe acute lung injury induced by influenza a h7n9 virus infection in an experimental mouse model moreover ace2 deficiency worsened the disease pathogenesis markedly mainly by targeting the at1 receptor13 this result is consistent with a study by huang et al who found that plasma ang ii levels were linked to h7n9-induced disease severity and predicted a fatal outcome in h7n9 patients62 myocardial injury has been observed during coronavirus infection6364 pulmonary infection with human sars-cov in mice led to an ace2-dependent myocardial infection and myocardial damage was found in patients who had sars-cov in their hearts53 thus the use of cardioprotective medications is essential the effect of ace inhibitor acei treatment during coronavirusesinfluenza virus infections in humans is unclear lei et al reported that fusion proteins ace2ig exhibit potent inhibitory activity against sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in vitro65 huentelman et al identified n-2-aminoethyl-1 aziridine-ethanamine as a novel ace2 inhibitor that was effective in blocking the sars coronavirus spike protein-mediated cell fusion66 a case study found that treatment with an acei together with plasma exchange improved the condition of a patient with scleroderma renal crisis complicated with thrombotic microangiopathy triggered by influenza b virus infection67 another case study of a woman positive for h1n1 and with severe acute left ventricular failure found that aggressive initial therapy followed by beta-blockers and aceis led to restoration of the patients left ventricular function and an associated marked improvement in symptoms68 angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs a first-line therapy of hypertension could inhibit the actions of ang ii through selective binding of at1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle69 and are effective in lowering bp and preventing major cv outcomes70 previous studies suggest that arbs could up-regulate ace2 in both rats and humans7172 a recent commentary suggested that arb could be used as a therapy for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from coronavirus infections73 there is now an urgent need to study the effect of acei and arb treatment during coronavirusinfluenza virus infections in humans vaccination constitutes the primary approach for controlling influenza in recent decades numerous advances have been made in the development of vaccines against influenza viruses such as the replacement of inactivated whole-virus vaccines with split or subunit vaccines which comprise less reactogenic alternatives74 the majority of available annual trivalent influenza vaccines contain two influenza a strains h1n1 and h3n2 and only one influenza b virus75 more recently inactivated quadrivalent vaccines containing both victoria and yamagata lineages of type b iv have become available7677 several epidemiological and clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of the influenza vaccine in patients with cv disease357879 in a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials udell et al reported that the use of the influenza vaccine was associated with a lower risk of major adverse cv events80 in another meta-analysis including eight trials with 12 029 participants clar et al reported that influenza vaccination may reduce cv mortality and combined cv events in patients with cv disease81 furthermore a recent meta-analysis including six cohort studies and 179 158 participants also confirmed that influenza vaccination was associated with a significant decrease in all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure82 to date no vaccine has been developed to prevent sars-cov-2 or other coronavirus infections scientists across the world are racing to develop a vaccine which is also a promising tool to prevent cv disease for the coronavirus to tackle the outbreak of covid-19 a role for ace2 in involvement in vascular protective actions has been postulated we therefore hypothesize that the risk of coronavirus or influenza virus infection is high among the cv disease-susceptible population at least partly due to high ace2 expression in this population which needs to be confirmed in the future our hypotheses suggest that more protection should be employed for patients with cv disease coronavirus or influenza virus vaccine usage in the high cv risk population could be a potential strategy to prevent both cv disease and coronavirusinfluenza virus infections furthermore there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine for coronavirus prevention and control and it will be important to evaluate the effect of coronavirus vaccines on cv protection 
conflict of interest none declared  a new normal for hypertension medicine with coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 proposal from the president of the japanese society of hypertension hiroshi itoh   in the last few decades we have managed to rein in famine plague and war of course these problems have not been solved but they have been transferred from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges was stated by yuval noah harari in homo deus a brief history of tomorrow 1 however even now or because of the current situation in which the world is tightly interconnected with advanced globalization the newly emerged plague covid-19 is a great menace threatening our entire existence including our health economics education and human relations covid-19 is still confronting us as a seemingly incomprehensible and uncontrollable disease until we make this disease a manageable issue which i do believe that we can achieve more time is needed for the creation of a sustainable new lifestyle standard with the challenge of covid-19 a new normal noncommunicable diseases ncds including hypertension have come to be recognized as the main health problem since 70 of deaths in the world 57 million deathsyear are attributed to ncds however great concern has emerged that the pandemic of covid-19 a communicable disease will create another pandemic of ncds 2 this prediction could be plausible considering our harsh and important japanese experiences of the great east japan earthquake that occurred on march 11 2011 and the subsequent nuclear accident at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant evacuation from the highly radioactive areas was performed a survey of the evacuees reported that even two years after the disaster their blood pressure remained significantly elevated by 45 mmhg on average and the incidence rates of obesity diabetes and dyslipidemia as well as hypertension remained 1215 times higher than those before the disaster 3 the current situations in 2020 under the policy of social distancing and stay at home with self-restraint from going out are similar to those of the evacuation in 2011 sudden death of familiar persons fear for death of ourselves stresses produced due to family members being in the house all day long feeling of detachment from friends and others job loss and economic difficulties and so on 2020 is the year of the 20th anniversary of the discovery of ace 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 4 it is a mystery why this molecule which cleaves angiotensin ii one of the central players of blood pressure and cardiovascular homeostasis into angiotensin 1-7 is used for the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 into host target cells 5 the renin-angiotensin system is a relatively new endocrine system in phyletic evolution that produces high blood pressure to deliver adequate oxygen and nutrients throughout the body for survival ace2 is expressed not only on pulmonary cells but also on intestinal and renal epithelial cells cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells 6 vascular endothelial cells are infected by sars-cov-2 resulting in the occurrence of systemic vasculitis and severe thromboembolism in relation to the cytokine storm chromosome x harbors the gene coding for ace-2 and the activity of transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 which facilitates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes is androgen dependent 7 these facts might be related to the sex preference of this disease 8 regulation of ace2 expression by sars-cov-2 infection or by the administration of ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers has been reported in in vitro cultured cells and in vivo animal models and its clinical implication for covid-19 has been argued 9 along with the observation that underlying cardiovascular diseases that are often caused by or complicated with hypertension are associated with an increased risk of severity of the disease 10 we should constantly attempt to discover and investigate the true picture of covid-19 in relation to hypertension that has so far been delineated that is what is known and what is not yet known to be well prepared for a possible pandemic of ncds including hypertension our sincere scientific approach to cope with the reality of hypertension with covid-19 would yield a new normal hypertension medicine this perspective opens up a new field of hypertension research to produce a concept of combined disease types of communicable and noncommunicable diseases specific to each persons particular lifestyle and life environment this new disease entity would include a new type of physical-mental stress-induced hypertension a new type of vasculitis with hypertension diseases evoked by lung-mediated organ miscommunication or cardiovascular dysregulation produced by discordance between the human host and microorganisms facing the difficulty of frequent face-to-face examination of the patients performed in old normal medical practice the new normal of hypertension medicine also prompts us to cultivate the digital transformation of the medical practice of hypertension management to realize life-long care to naturally maintain a happy and healthy life respecting the diversity of each person with hypertension the establishment of a medical care system with constant connection to each person with hypertension by various iot internet of things technologies and a medical advisory system to give personalized proper advice at the appropriate time according to the lifelog data of each person and the construction of a dynamic community remodeled with mutual dependence on each persons diverse quality of life are expected among them the most important requirement is a redesign of the image of medical doctors being engaged in hypertension medicine to welcome the new normal of hypertension medicine  hypertension thrombosis kidney failure and diabetes is covid-19 an endothelial disease a comprehensive evaluation of clinical and basic evidence celestino sardu jessica gambardella marco morelli bruno xujun wang raffaele marfella gaetano santulli   coronavirus disease covid-19 represents a public health crisis of global proportions 1 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 sars-cov-2 covid-19 was first announced in december 2019 in wuhan the capital of chinas hubei province 23 the symptoms most commonly reported include cough fever and shortness of breath the pathophysiology of the disease explains why respiratory symptoms are so common indeed the virus accesses host cells via the protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 45 which is very abundant in the lungs 6 nevertheless ace2 is also expressed by endothelial cells 78 and other major clinical events usually observed in covid-19 patients eg high blood pressure 910111213 thrombosis 141516 kidney disease 1718 pulmonary embolism 1920 cerebrovascular and neurologic disorders 2122 indicate that the virus is targeting the endothelium 23 one of the largest organs in the human body 242526 the cases of kawasaki disease reported in young covid-19 patients 27 support our view of a systemic vasculitis caused by sars-cov-2 to access host cells sars-cov-2 uses a surface glycoprotein peplomer known as spike ace2 has been shown to be a co-receptor for coronavirus entry 282930 therefore the density of ace2 in each tissue may correlate with the severity of the disease in that tissue 313233343536 other receptors on the surface of human cells have been suggested to mediate the entry of sars-cov-2 5 including transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 3738 sialic acid receptors 3940 and extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer cd147 also known as basigin 41 additionally catepsin b and l have been shown to be critical entry factors in the pathogenesis of covid-19 3842 intriguingly all of these factors involved in the entry of sars-cov-2 in the host cell are known to be expressed by endothelial cells 43444546474849 figure 1 ace2 remains the most studied of these receptors 345051525354 for instance its genetic inactivation has been shown to cause severe lung injury in h5n1-challenged mice 55 whereas administration of recombinant human ace2 ameliorates h5n1 virus-induced lung injury in mice 55 ace2 is currently at the center of a heated debate among physicians 56575859 and there are concerns that medical management of hypertension including the use of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas may contribute to the adverse health outcomes observed 346061 tmprss2 binds the viral spike glycoprotein 37 recent structural assays have suggested that coronaviruses can bind sialic acid receptors 39 cd147 has been shown to be essential for the entry of cytomegalovirus into endothelial cells 46 both catepsin b 47 and l 49 are present in endothelial cells figure 1 the endothelium prevents blood clotting by providing an antithrombotic surface maintained by heparan sulphate present in the matrix surrounding the cells 6263 by the expression of tissue factor inhibitor 64 thrombomodulin 65 and by the production of tissue-type plasminogen activator that promotes fibrinolysis 6667 endothelial dysfunction refers to a systemic condition in which the endothelium loses its physiological properties including the tendency to promote vasodilation fibrinolysis and anti-aggregation 6869707172 moreover endothelial dysfunction appears to be a consistent finding in patients with diabetes 69737475767778 here we will discuss clinical and preclinical findings supporting our hypothesis 79 that covid-19 impairs endothelial function figure 1 several investigators have called attention to the potential over-representation of hypertension among patients with covid-19 13808182 moreover hypertension appears to track closely with advancing age which is emerging as one of the strongest predictors of covid-19related death 1483 specifically observational trials and retrospectives studies conducted near wuhan area have actually shown that hypertension is the most common co-morbidity observed in patients affected by covid-19 ranging from 15 to over 30 1484858687 one of the largest studies has been conducted by guan et al between december 11 2019 and january 29 2020 providing data on 1099 hospitalized patients and outpatients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection 84 in this cohort 165 15 had high blood pressure 84 the authors also evaluated the severity of disease and the composite outcome of intensive care unit icu admission mechanical ventilation and death concluding that 237 of hypertensive patients had disease severity vs 134 of normotensive subjects and that 358 vs 137 reached the composite endpoint of icu admission mechanical ventilation and death 84 the high rate of hypertensive patients with covid-19 was later confirmed in a prospective analysis on 41 patients admitted to hospital in wuhan 85 as well as in a large study conducted on 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed covid-19 infection 86 in the latter report the rate of hypertension was 312 and 583 of hypertensive patients with covid-19 infection were admitted to icu compared to 216 of individuals with normal blood pressure 86 evidencing the hypertensive state as a common co-morbidity and cause of icu admission in covid-19 patients 86 similarly among 191 covid-19 patients from jinyintan hospital and wuhan pulmonary hospital 58 30 had hypertension and 26 48 did not survive covid-19 whereas 32 23 were survivors 14 the 30 rate of hypertensive patients was further confirmed in an analysis based on the severity of covid-19 conducted on 140 patients in wuhan 58 patients were classified as severe vs 82 patients classified as not severe hypertensive patients represented 379 of severe vs 244 of not severe covid-19 patients 87 in a cohort of 1590 patients from 575 hospitals underlying hypertension was independently associated with severe covid-19 hazard ratio 158 95 ci 107232 13 overall these findings confirm a dual aspect of hypertension during covid-19 pandemic first hypertension is the most common co-morbidity observed in covid-19 patients second hypertension is evidenced in patients with worse prognosis and higher rate of death these studies also raise numerous questions regarding the association between hypertension and covid-19 indeed hypertension is known to be one of most common diseases and co-morbidities worldwide considered a silent killer for the worldwide population 88 we speculate that the higher rate of hypertension and the worse prognosis in patients with covid-19 infection could be seen as the spy of a cause-effect mechanism more than as a casual pre-existing association between these two different diseases ace inhibitors acei and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arb represent very effective strategies for the treatment of hypertension 88 these drugs reduce the effects of renin-angiotensin axis by inhibiting ace acei or by blocking the angiotensin receptors arb as shown in figure 2 a growing question for the scientific community and physicians is to understand whether aceiarb could affect the prognosis of hypertensive covid-19 patients 34899091 the exact role of aceiarb in the control of ace2 molecular pathways is controversial indeed preclinical studies evidenced that the selective blockade of either angiotensin ii synthesis or activity in rats induces increases in ace2 gene expression and activity 9293949596 similarly treating infarcted rats with arb increased plasma concentration of angiotensin 17 and ace2 97 in mice arb treatment augmented ace2 mrna and protein levels 9899 and prevented the decrease in ace2 protein levels induced by angiotensin ii 100 equally important mineralocorticoid receptor blockers prevented aldosterone-induced reduction in cardiac ace2 mrna expression in rat cardiomyocytes 101 and increased ace2 expression and activity in murine hearts and in monocyte-derived macrophages obtained from ten patients with heart failure 102 nevertheless there is no clinical evidence that acei could directly affect molecular pathways linked to ace2 activity for instance urinary ace2 levels were reported to be higher in patients treated with olmesartan vs untreated controls but this finding was not observed in patients treated with other arb or enalapril 103 instead another study reported no difference in ace2 activity in patients who were taking acei or arb vs untreated patients 89 of note ace2 which functions as a carboxypeptidase 104 is not inhibited by clinically prescribed acei in particular ace2 acts to counterbalance the effect of ace 105 indeed whereas ace generates angiotensin ii from angiotensin i ace2 converts angiotensin ii into an active heptapeptide angiotensin 1-7 which binds the mas receptor masr triggering vasodilative anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties 106107108109 figure 2 some media sources have recently called for the discontinuation of acei and arb both prophylactically and in the context of suspected covid-19 110 however several associations have recommended not to suspend these therapies 61111112113114 and these recommendations have been confirmed by three recent studies the first one performed on 362 hypertensive patients showed that aceisarbs are not associated with the severity or mortality of covid-19 91 the second one verified the effects of aceiarb on 1128 hypertensive covid-19 patients showing that the use of aceiarb was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with aceiarb non-users 115 the third one demonstrated that without increasing the risk for sars-cov-2 infection aceiarb outcompeted other antihypertensive drugs in reducing inflammatory markers like c-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels in covid-19 patients with preexisting hypertension 116 consistent with these findings three observational studies performed in different populations and with different designs 117118119 published in the same issue of the new england journal of medicine arrived at the consistent message that the continued use of aceiarb is unlikely to be harmful in covid-19 patients notably in one of these studies 117 the use of either acei or statinstwo classes of drugs that are known to ameliorate endothelial function 120121122123was found to be associated with a lower risk of in-hospital death than non-use the binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to ace2 has been suggested to cause the down-regulation of ace2 from the cell membrane 124 consequently ace2 down-regulation could lead to a loss of protective effects exerted by aceiarb in humans 125 such down-regulation of ace2 is an attractive research field 95126127128 indeed it could be a valid therapeutic target to ameliorate response and clinical prognosis in hypertensive patients affected by covid-19 moreover some investigators proposed the restoration of ace2 by administration of recombinant ace2 to reverse the lung-injury process during viral infections 4 actually these effects are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials clinicaltrialsgov nct04287686 alongside the use of losartan as first therapy for covid-19 in hospitalized nct04312009 or not hospitalized patients nct04311177 a major role in the pathogenesis of as well as in the clinical response to covid-19 could also be played by ace2 polymorphisms which are relatively under-investigated if compared to ace 129130 finally we have to consider the higher rate of cardiac injury and adverse outcomes in hypertensive patients during the covid-19 pandemic 131132133 therefore aceiarb chronic therapy should not be discontinued in hypertensive patients with covid-19 indeed the loss of their pneumo- and cardio- protective effects could be detrimental 88 in addition in the absence of adequate follow-up visits switching from aceiarb to another anti-hypertensive therapy could cause a suboptimal control of blood pressure thus as suggested by several medical associations 110 in the absence of definitive clinical studies and without clear evidence hypertensive patients should avoid discontinuation andor therapeutic switching during covid-19 infection another noteworthy feature of covid-19 for cardiologists is the significant decrease in the rates of hospital admissions for acute coronary syndromes which has been reported both in italy 134 and us 135 during the covid-19 outbreak and despite being initially attributed to reduced air pollution better adherence to treatment or absence of occupational stress during lockdown this phenomenon seems to be most likely due to the fear of going to the hospital andor seeking medical attention during a pandemic unfortunately the current decline in hospitalization for acute coronary syndromes will trigger an increase in cases of heart failure in the near future acute kidney injury aki has been reported in  20 of critically ill or deceased covid-19 patients a percentage that is consistent in studies from china 136 italy 137 and united states 10 it is important to note that aki proteinuria and hematuria have been independently associated with a higher risk of death in covid-19 patients 138 furthermore in a meta-analysis including 1389 covid-19 patients 139 the prevalence of underlying chronic kidney disease was significantly more frequent among those with a severe covid-19 disease 33 vs 04 odds ratio 303 95 ci 109847 according to immunohistochemistry assays 140 ace2 seems not to be expressed in renal endothelial cells however a study based on single-cell analysis has confirmed the expression of ace2 and tmprss2 in human renal endothelial cells 141 and most recently the presence of viral particles was confirmed by electron microscopy in endothelial cells of the glomerular capillary loops of a covid-19 patient 142 besides endothelial damage was a common finding in renal histopathological analyses of 26 covid-19 patients in the absence of interstitial inflammatory infiltrates 143 diabetes mellitus is a frequent co-morbidity and a cause of worse prognosis in covid-19 patients 12144145146147148 indeed evaluating pneumonia cases of unknown causes reported in wuhan and in patients with history of exposure to huanan seafood market before jan 1 2020 20 had diabetes 85 similarly among 1099 covid-19 patients analyzed by guan and colleagues 74 had diabetes this percentage goes up to 162 among patients with severe disease vs 57 in patients with non-severe disease 84 furthermore 358 of patients experiencing the composite endpoint of icu admission mechanical ventilation and death had diabetes vs 137 of patients that did not experience such endpoint 84 data from italy show that more than two-thirds of covid-19 patients that did not survive had diabetes 149 in summary diabetes is a frequent co-morbidity a risk factor and an independent prognostic factor in covid-19 patients a strong evidence of the negative effects of diabetes in covid-19 patients is also corroborated by two meta-analyses 150151 the worse prognosis in patients with diabetes and covid-19 could be attributed to the fact that the pneumonia evolves towards clinical stages more refractory to medical therapies oxygen administration and mechanical ventilation with necessity of icu care these data have been investigated in a previous study conducted in patients with sars 152 in which the relationship between a known history of diabetes and fasting plasma glucose fpg levels with death and morbidity rate was assessed showing that the percentage of patients with diabetes was significantly higher in deceased vs survivors 215 vs 39 p  001 152 moreover diabetic subjects with hypoxemia sao2  93 had higher fpg levels and fpg was independently associated with an increased hazard ratio of mortality 11 95 ci 1011 and hypoxia 11 95 ci 1011 after controlling for age and gender 152 the authors concluded that both diabetes 30 95 ci 1463 and fpg  or  70 mmoll 33 95 ci 1477 were independent predictors of death 152 in covid-19 patients the incidence of diabetes is two times higher in icusevere vs non-icusevere cases 151 indeed the diagnosis of diabetes in a cohort of patients with covid-19 infection evidenced a sub-group of patients with a 226-fold higher risk of experiencing adverse disease outcome analyses 150 additionally patients with obesity andor glucose intolerance seem to be particularly vulnerable to covid-19 10148153154 unfortunately no data are hitherto available on anti-diabetic medications and glucose homeostasis in covid-19 patients this aspect is really limiting because diabetes and altered glucose homeostasis during a condition of severe pneumonia with sars are reported as main factors of worse prognosis and death 152 covid-19 could also induce new onset diabetes by augmenting insulin resistance andor by a direct action 155 on the islets of langerhans supporting this view previous studies have shown that ace2 can be a therapeutic target to ameliorate microcirculation in the islets 156 and ace2 is known to be expressed by pancreatic beta cells 157158159160161162 moreover frequent cases of ketoacidosis in covid-19 patients have been reported 163 therefore the investigation of anti-diabetic medications and glucose homeostasis could be harnessed to evaluate patients with higher risk of experiencing worse prognosis and death by covid-19 we speculate that the amelioration of glucose homeostasis in diabetic covid-19 patients by specific hypoglycemic drugs could result in the amelioration of clinical outcomes with death reduction however these data are not reported in trials on covid-19 and they need to be investigated in further studies 164 patients with covid19 often show clotting disorders with organ dysfunction and coagulopathy resulting in higher mortality 15165166 critical data came from the analysis of coagulation tests including prothrombin time pt activated partial thromboplastin time aptt antithrombin activity at fibrinogen fibrin degradation product fdp and d-dimer in samples collected on admission and during the hospital stay of covid-19 patients 167 non-survivors had significantly higher d-dimer and fdp levels and longer pt vs survivors on admission 167 moreover significant reduction and lowering of fibrinogen and at levels were observed in non-survivors during late stages of hospitalization which is compatible with a clinical diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation dic 167168 specifically among 191 covid-19 patients seen at two hospitals in wuhan d-dimer levels over 1 gl at admission predicted an 18-fold increase in odds of dying before discharge 14 of note when dic is caused by a systemic infection it features an acute systemic over-inflammatory response strictly linked to endothelial dysfunction 169 most recently a case of a covid-19 patient with an increase of factor viii clotting activity and a massive elevation of von willebrand factor vwf has been reported 170 further supporting our theory indeed vwf can be seen as a marker of endothelial damage since it is normally stored in weibel-palade bodies within endothelial cells 171 equally important angiotensin ii level in the plasma of covid-19 patients was markedly elevated and linearly associated to viral load and lung injury 172 notably angiotensin ii is known to increase microvascular permeability 173174 to induce the transcription of tissue factor in endothelial cells 175176177 and to activate platelets 178179180 additionally angiotensin ii can trigger the release of several components of the complement system from endothelial cells 181182183184185186187 further corroborating the key role of endothelium in the pathogenesis of venous and arterial thrombosis in covid-19 patients 188189 a dysregulated immune response as observed in covid-19 especially in the late stages of the disease plays a decisive role in endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis 190191 and microvascular permeability is crucial in viral infections 192 indeed pulmonary endothelium represent a fundamental barrier between the blood and interstitium and have vital regulatory functions specifically endothelial cells represent one-third of the cell population of the lung 193 and pulmonary endothelial damage is considered the hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 194 animal models of coronavirus-induced severe ards have shown that reduced ace2 activity and loss of ace2 in the lungs is mirrored by enhanced vascular permeability and exacerbated pulmonary edema 108 the functional role of endothelium in pulmonary disease is also suggested by previous reports 195196 for instance the h3n2 influenza virus has been shown to infect endothelial cells in vitro and to trigger endothelial cell apoptosis which is known to enhance platelet adhesion 197 endothelial cell death would cause exposure of the extracellular matrix to circulating blood favoring platelet binding similarly the endothelium has been shown to contribute to the development of severe disease during h5n1 influenza infection 198 deep vein thrombosis andor pulmonary embolism have been previously described in patients with sars 199200201202 and cases of thrombosis complicating influenza-associated pneumonia have also been reported 203204205 excessive activation of the immune system in response to pathogens can lead to pathological inflammatory consequences in the case of highly virulent 1918 and avian h5n1 influenza virus infections the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes followed by excessive cytokine responses is considered to be the key contributor to morbidity and mortality of the infection 206207 cytokine storm syndromes css are a group of disorders representing a variety of inflammatory etiologies with the final result of overwhelming systemic inflammation hemodynamic instability multiple organ dysfunction and potentially death 208209 specifically macrophage activation syndrome 210 and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh 211 represent two clinically similar css with an unknown degree of etiopathogenic overlap 208 the interaction between endothelial and immune cells could play a crucial role in covid-19 especially in severe cases and in the late stages of the disease 212 for instance the cytokine storm might lead to an abrupt deterioration of the inflammatory response and hyper-coagulation the increased vulnerability of patients with cardiovascular diseases andor diabetes might therefore simply reflect the impact of the underlying chronic inflammation and its response during sars-cov-2 infection if this is the case endothelial alterations could just be seen as an epiphenomenon however according to numerous investigators the inflammatory response observed in covid-19 patients can be considered mild if compared to the one observed in typical ards and in cytokine-release syndrome 212213214215 indeed in ards patients levels of interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 have been shown to be 10 to 60 fold higher than in covid-19 216217 therefore other mechanisms have to be involved in order to explain the systemic manifestations reported in covid-19 patients and endothelial cells known orchestrators of cytokine amplification during viral infections 218 seem to be one of the best candidates in this sense further supporting our view catecholamines are considered an essential component of the cytokine release syndrome 215 and we have demonstrated that endothelial cells are able to synthetize and release catecholamines 219 acute pulmonary embolism reported in covid-19 patients 20220221222 has been shown to be a cause of clinical deterioration in viral pneumonias 205223 endothelial dysfunction is known to be a key determinant in hypertension thrombosis and dic 72224225226227 henceforth it is important to select covid-19 patients at higher risk of pulmonary embolism and practice computed tomography pulmonary angiography for the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism especially in case of significant increase of d-dimer values anticoagulation could be a necessary therapy to control and reduce pro-thrombotic events as well as to prevent pulmonary embolism 228 the clinical course of covid-19 consists of two main phases viral infection and immuneinflammatory response figure 3 which require distinct therapeutic approaches strikingly several drugs suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for covid-19 229230231 have been shown to ameliorate endothelial function including interleukin 6 il-6 receptor antagonists eg tocilizumab 232 colchicine 233 azithromycin 234 and famotidine 235 even the antimalaric agents chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine initially proposed as a therapy for covid-19 based on anecdotal data 229236 have been shown to improve endothelial function 237238 if our theory is correct 239 other drugs that might be effective in treating covid-19 patients through their beneficial effects on endothelial cells include 1 adrenergic receptor blockers eg doxazosin 240 modulators of sigma receptors 241242243 metformin 244 indomethacin 245 and endothelin receptor antagonists eg bosentan 246 however data from randomized trials confirming the actual efficacy of these drugs are not yet available as discussed before covid-19 infection could cause endothelial dysfunction and a hyper-coagulation state this condition is aggravated by hypoxia which augments thrombosis by both increasing blood viscosity and hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-dependent signaling pathway 247 consequently these phenomena could result in pulmonary embolism with occlusion and micro-thrombosis in pulmonary small vessels as observed in critical covid-19 patients 248 apart from cases of pulmonary embolism covid-19 can cause a sepsis-associated dic which is defined as sepsis-induced coagulopathy sic 169 thus there is an increasing interest in anticoagulant therapy to treat covid-19 249 in a retrospective analysis conducted at tongji hospital of huazhong university of science and technology in wuhan the authors examined 449 patients affected by severe covid-19 228 the diagnosis of severe covid-19 disease was made by evidence of respiratory rate  30 breathsmin arterial oxygen saturation  93 at rest and pao2fio2  300 mmhg 228 in these patients they reviewed and compared the parameters of coagulation tests and clinical characteristics between survivors and non-survivors to evaluate the effects of heparin therapy 228 94 patients received low molecular weight heparin lmwh 4060 mg enoxaparinday and 5 received unfractionated heparin ufh 1000015000 uday without other anti-coagulants 228 heparin therapy significantly reduced mortality in patients with sic score 4 400 vs 642 p  005 but not in those with sic score  4 290 vs 226 p  005 228 d-dimer pt and age were positively while platelet count was negatively correlated with 28-day mortality 228 in addition stratifying by d-dimer values the study population the authors reported in heparin non-users a rise of mortality linked to the rising d-dimer and 20 reduction of mortality for patients under heparin with d-dimer exceeding 30 gml 228 therefore heparin treatment appears to be associated with better prognosis in severe covid-19 patients with coagulopathy the beneficial effects of heparin-based therapies are also supported by the structural analogies between heparin and heparan-sulphate which according to some investigators may confer heparin with antiviral properties 250251252253254 in absence of contraindications we suggest the use of enoxaparin 40 mgday in all covid-19 patients to be raised up to 1 mgkg every 12 h in case of d-dimer  30 gml apixaban 5 mg every 12 h could represent a useful alternative of course the full clinical evaluation of patients with covid-19 infection cannot leave aside the analysis of laboratory and imaging data we believe that ptptt fibrinogen and d-dimer should be monitored daily and anticoagulation therapy should be recommended for covid-19 patients when the d-dimer value is four times higher than the normal upper limit except for patients with anticoagulant contraindications the confirmed diagnosis of severe covid-19 disease in patients with hypercoagulation and organ failure could evidence an early stage of sepsis-induced dic on the other hand anticoagulant may not benefit unselected patients consequently further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings in covid-19 patients also testing other anti-aggregants and anti-coagulants at different doses  comorbid medical conditions in young athletes considerations for preparticipation guidance during the covid-19 pandemic kimberly harmon g paul pottinger s aaron baggish l jonathan drezner a andrew luks m alexis thompson a sankar swaminathan   young athletes generally speaking represent one of the healthiest and fittest groups in society the resumption of sport and exercise will ultimately bring athletes into closer proximity than is recommended by current physical distancing practices potentially increasing ones risk of infection data are emerging that high-intensity exercise may increase aerosolization and transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 from presymptomatic and mildly symptomatic individuals9 it is in this setting that medical providers have wondered how to best counsel athletes with medical conditions that may be associated with increased risk of severe coronavirus disease covid-19 specifically diabetes asthma sickle cell trait sct hypertension and obesity the centers for disease control and prevention cdc guidance does not explicitly address young athletes returning to sport but recommends that high-risk individuals of any age take extra precautions including those with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma chronic kidney disease being treated with dialysis diabetes mellitus hemoglobin disorders liver disease serious heart conditions severe obesity body mass index bmi 40 kgm2 or who are immunocompromised2 there is limited epidemiologic evidence to inform guidance for such individuals especially in the high school and college age groups however young people in general are at low risk for poor outcomes including death hospitalization and severe disease here we offer our appraisal of the situation and provide information that may help frame discussions with athletes the vast majority of deaths from coronavirus occur in those older than 25 years of age with those aged 15 to 24 years representing only 01 of all deaths3 of those younger than 24 years of age who died from the virus 4 had hypertension 21 were obese and 15 had diabetes3 prevalence of these conditions in the general adolescent population is similar for hypertension 48 and obesity 2066 but is much lower for diabetes 0251 while no conclusions can be drawn based on limited data the outcomes in this age group are consistent with the poor outcomes seen in patients with diabetes who contract covid-19 in the general population 1 study showed a 4-fold increased risk of severecritical illness independent of other risk factors16 athletes with diabetes should be counseled regarding the potential for increased morbidity and mortality if infected with covid-19 and consider delaying return until sports reintegration is confirmed safe and the risk of acquiring a new infection is better understood asthma affects 84 of the population from 0 to 17 years of age with about 5 experiencing 1 or more asthma attacks per year5 cdc guidelines suggest that only those with moderate to severe asthma are in the high-risk category while mild well-controlled asthma is not considered a risk for poor outcomes12 moderate asthma is characterized as having daily symptoms that cause some limitation of normal activities and a forced expiratory volume fev of 60 to 8012 exercise-induced bronchospasm is common among athletes especially during the winter and in endurance sports but is not known to confer a higher risk of poor outcomes with sars-cov-2 infection athletes with asthma should be evaluated prior to participation in sports to confirm their treatment regimen is optimized and they are adherent to their medications additionally they should be advised to notify their medical team of any exacerbations of existing medical conditions or illness participation should be avoided in any individual with worsening asthma control sct is also common with 9 of african americanblack individuals carrying the gene although generally considered benign sct has been associated with an increased risk of exertional death in football athletes and military recruits as well as increased risk of venous thromboembolism713 although sickle cell disease and thalassemia are considered by the cdc as higher risk for adverse outcomes with covid-19 infection sct is not no additional precautions are recommended for returning athletes with sct however if an athlete with sct contracts sars-cov-2 treating physicians should be vigilant for issues related to hypercoagulability both during the acute illness and for several months into recovery this includes allowing adequate acclimatization and reconditioning while optimizing hydration minimizing heat stress and avoiding blood flow restriction devices used for rehabilitation and strengthening the prevalence of hypertension in athletes appears to be similar to that of the general adolescent population 4 however studies suggest that american football lineman with higher bmi are more likely to be affected4 studies of hypertension in athletes are limited and often rely on one-time blood pressure measurements rather than standard diagnostic criteria the frequency with which covid-19 patients are hypertensive is not unexpected given the age distribution of sars-cov-2 infection and does not necessarily imply a causal relationship however concern remains that hypertension may be an independent risk factor for poor outcomes even though the cdc does not currently list hypertension as a predictor of severe illness215 there was initial concern that treatment of hypertension with angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers arbs could increase the susceptibility to covid-19 infection or worsen its course however several large studies did not support these hypotheses and the american heart association does not recommend stopping ace inhibitors or arbs in patients with covid-191114 thus athletes with controlled hypertension should maintain their current regimen when returning to participation newly diagnosed hypertension should be treated as clinically appropriate preparticipation screening should include accurate measurement of blood pressure with repeat measurements if abnormal and presenting an opportunity to engage the athlete in discussions regarding treatment finally although most athletes are fit many sports recruit athletes with a larger build particularly american football lineman the cdc groups people with severe obesity bmi40 kgm2 as potentially at risk for severe illness although the literature associated with covid-19 employs variable definitions of obesity some including those with bmi 25 kgm22 bmi is intended to be a marker of excess fat but may not be a good measure in athletes as lean muscle mass is typically increased with lower percentages of body fat studies have shown an increased association of poor covid-19 outcomes with higher bmis one study found this to be true especially in younger patients with bmis 30 kgm2 and even more so among those with bmi 35 kgm210 as in the general population those with higher bmi are also more likely to have other comorbidities such as hypertension or diabetes athletes with a high bmi particularly those with a higher percentage of body fat should be counseled on the overall adverse health effects of obesity and potential association with complications from covid-19 and should be supported in adopting a healthy lifestyle lifestyle modifications in athletes who derive competitive advantage from higher bmi and are unwilling to consider weight reduction may be limited but should be addressed preparticipation guidance for all athletes should include a discussion of risks of sars-cov-2 athletes with diabetes appear to be at higher risk for poor outcomes however there is no evidence that athletes with asthma sct and hypertension are at higher risk of poor outcomes and it is unclear if obese athletes are at higher risk all athletes should be engaged in a shared decision-making process that involves education acknowledgement of uncertainty and optimization of medical treatment the risk of poor outcomes in those younger than 25 years of age remains low and youth and high levels of fitness may effectively mitigate the risk of severe covid-19 outcomes in athletes with pre-existing risk factors the collection of these data is critical to better understanding the interplay of these elements exercise and sport are beneficial for both physical and mental health we should attempt to mitigate risks for returning athletes by addressing potential risk factors encouraging compliance with public health guidelines and adjusting recommendations as the situation and evidence evolve  estimated demand for us hospital inpatient and intensive care unit beds for patients with covid-19 based on comparisons with wuhan and guangzhou china ruoran li caitlin rivers qi tan megan murray b eric toner marc lipsitch   in the 2 months after the first report of 4 cases of atypical pneumonia in wuhan china on december 27 20191 the cumulative number of confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in the city rose to 49 122 with 2195 deaths by the end of february 20202 on january 23 wuhan city shut down in response to the quickly evolving epidemic all public transportation within to and from the city was suspended and residents were barred from leaving an estimated 9 million people remained in the city after the lockdown3 strict social distancing measures were also implemented including the compulsory wearing of face masks in public during the early phase of the response in wuhan the number of patients overwhelmed local fever clinics and hospitals designated to receive patients with covid-19 the media reported a significant shortage of hospital beds intensive care unit icu beds and other health care resources by february 12 more than 18 000 health care workers had been sent to wuhan from other parts of china to help with the coronavirus response4 a total of 48 hospitals including 2 new hospitals built specifically for patients with covid-19 and more than 26 000 inpatient beds were designated for the isolation and treatment of patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 quarantine centers with more than 13 000 total beds were also established to isolate confirmed patients with milder illness by the end of february the local government reported that finally patients dont need to wait for beds now the beds are waiting for patients5 with human-to-human transmission now established in other countries mitigating the potential consequences of covid-19 on local health care systems is a top priority a clinical study from china1 reported that 81 of patients in whom sars-cov-2 is detected experience mild disease 14 experience severe disease and 5 experience critical disease however questions still remain regarding the proportion of asymptomatic patients and the clinical course of the disease preventing accurate prediction of hospitalization and icu needs with transmission models here we describe the icu and hospitalization needs for covid-19 in 2 cities in china ie wuhan the epicenter of chinas outbreak and guangzhou a metropolis that experienced an early importation of cases as in all cities in china guangzhou implemented strict social distancing measures contact tracing and quarantine protocols in late january which resulted in a much smaller outbreak size than in wuhan describing and comparing the resource needs in both cities may create benchmarks to help other large metropolises prepare for potential outbreaks we summed the total patient-days under critical andor severe condition to estimate the total icu-days and serious inpatientdays we plotted the raw number of patients in critical and severe condition and patients hospitalized on each day for wuhan and guangzhou and estimated the proportion of hospitalizations and icu admissions per 10 000 adults based on the assumption that there were 9 million people present in wuhan during the lockdown3 of whom 8816 were aged 15 years or older9 and 149 million people present in guangzhou of whom 8282 were aged 15 years or above10 we then projected the number of patients who would have severe and critical covid-19 at the peak of a wuhan-like outbreak in the 30 most populous us cities by assuming that the associations of age and comorbidity with patient outcomes would be the same as their association with covid-19 mortality as derived from case reports from china until february 1111 specifically we estimated the stratum-specific critical care rate in wuhan by assuming that the risk factor for being in critical care was the same as that for death ie for adults age 65 years or over rate ratio 72 for adults with hypertention rate ratio 6911 we estimated the probability of being in critical condition at the peak of the epidemic in each age and hypertension stratum using the covid-19 mortality rate ratios for age and hypertension11 and the proportion of the wuhan population in each stratum the hypertension prevalence in adults in wuhan was estimated as 25712 and the proportion of the population aged 65 years or older was estimated as 14113 we applied these stratum-specific critical care rates to population structures in us cities based on crude hypertension prevalence in adults in 201714 and the proportion of the adult population aged 65 years and older in these cities15 the data on us icu beds16 empty icu beds17 inpatient beds18 and population structure19 were used to estimate inpatient bed capacity per 10 000 adults we used wuhan-like outbreak to describe an outbreak in a large metropolis where minimal disease control measures were implemented during the first 2 months of community spread of sars-cov-2 followed by city-level lockdown measures to suppress transmission all analyses were conducted in r version 363 r project for statistical computing and no prespecified level of statistical significance was set in wuhan covid-19 accounted for a total of 32 486 icu-days and 176 136 serious inpatientdays between january 10 and february 29 figure 1a and figure 1b with a median interquartile range of 429 25-1143 patients in the icu and 1521 111-7202 inpatients with serious illness each day during that 51-day period during the peak of the epidemic from mid to late february a maximum of 19 425 patients 245 per 10 000 adults were hospitalized 9689 patients 122 per 10 000 adults were considered in serious condition and 2087 patients 26 per 10 000 adults needed critical care per day in guangzhou covid-19 accounted for a total of 318 icu-days and 724 serious inpatientdays between january 24 and february 29 figure 1c and figure 1d with a median interquartile range of 9 7-12 patients in the icu and 17 15-26 inpatients with serious illness each day during that 37-day period during the peak of the epidemic early february 15 patients were in critical condition while 38 were hospitalized and classified as serious unlike wuhan where patients with mild covid-19 disease were isolated in quarantine centers and not in designated hospitals all confirmed patients in guangzhou were hospitalized until recovery the maximum number of hospitalizations in guangzhou on any day was 271 patients at the peak of the epidemic we estimated the critical care risk among adults younger than 65 years to be 12 patients per 10 000 adults among adults aged 65 years or older 80 patients per 10 000 adults among adults without hypertension 13 patients per 10 000 adults and among adults with hypertension 95 patients per 10 000 adults in the 30 most populous cities in the us 110 to 225 adults are aged 65 years or older15 and the crude hypertension prevalence ranges from 220 to 46914 the projected number of prevalent critically ill patients at the peak of a wuhan-like outbreak in us cities ranged from 22 to 32 patients per 10 000 adults when the difference in age distribution was taken into account figure 2a and from 28 to 44 patients per 10 000 adults when the differences in hypertension prevalence was taken into account figure 2b this study has several limitations we relied on officially reported statistics which may not represent the change of actual case counts over time but rather reflect the capacity of testing and hospitalization thus the number of serious cases and hospitalizations in wuhan is not reflective of actual need but rather of the maximum capacity of the system of diagnosis and treatment therefore we are more confident regarding the hospitalization and serious case counts in wuhan after mid-february and in guangzhou where capacities in diagnosis and treatment were not exceeded according to both official and unofficial sources furthermore we have only accounted for the differences in age and hypertension distribution between wuhan and us cities but we did not account for other potential risk factors such as diabetes cardiovascular diseases and chronic respiratory diseases11 because no mutually adjusted associations of these risk factors with covid-19 serious illness or death were available at the time of our analysis and because cardiometabolic risk factors likely coexist in the same population we used hypertension adjustment as a proxy for adjusting other known comorbidities in addition our projection of the icu bed needs in us cities did not consider scenarios in which local transmission differs from that of wuhan the contact rate in wuhan during the early phase of the epidemic may have been much higher than what we expect to occur in us cities because of the increased number of social contacts that occurred in wuhan because of the lunar new year celebrations if social distancing measures are effectively implemented early in us cities the growth of the epidemic may be delayed but it is also possible that us cities may not be able to implement the extreme social distancing measures that were put in place later in wuhan we further assumed that both settings had an equal age- or hypertension-specific incidence rate of severe and critical covid-19 cases but we did not account for differences in contact patterns in vulnerable populations such as in nursing homes therefore the actual number of hospital and icu beds that will be needed during the course of a covid-19 outbreak in a us city is impossible to estimate precisely our estimated capacity needs based on a wuhan-like outbreak could be a benchmark for what health care systems would expect to see during the first 3 months of a local covid-19 epidemic if the same outbreak control measures were implemented as in wuhan even after the lockdown of wuhan on january 23 2020 the number of patients with serious covid-19 cases continued to rise exceeding local hospitalization and icu capacities for at least a month plans are urgently needed to mitigate the consequences of covid-19 outbreaks on local health care systems in us cities  sex-specific sars-cov-2 mortality among hormone-modulated ace2 expression risk of venous thromboembolism and hypovitaminosis d sandro la vignera rossella cannarella rosita condorelli a francesco torre antonio aversa aldo calogero e   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 infection disease covid-19 was firstly described in december 2019 in wuhan hubei province china and officially declared a public health emergency by the who on january 30 2020 having infected more than 100000 people in over 100 countries 1 data published by the who on april 15 2020 show a number of coronavirus cases as high as 2000243 with 126758 deaths httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus the study of covid-19 epidemiology is important to understand the pathogenic mechanisms and to design better therapeutic strategies current evidence has shown that the covid-19 mortality rate is comorbidity-dependent in 45000 chinese patients positive to covid-19 the crude case mortality rate was 09 in patients without comorbidities and it increased to 105 73 and 63 in patients with cardiovascular disease cvd diabetes mellitus or hypertension respectively 2 italy has recorded 162488 confirmed cases and 21067 deaths april 15 2020 httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus according to the last available age-related analysis of mortality released by the italian istituto superiore di sanit iss on march 30 2020 89 of the deceased patients were 90 years old 397 were 8089 years old 355 were 7079 years old 112 were 6069 years old and 09 were 4049 years old similar to chinese statistics sars-cov-2 shows higher mortality rates in patients with one or more comorbidities in italy only 21 of deaths were represented by people with no documented comorbidity whereas 213 259 and 507 regarded patients with one two three or more comorbidities respectively a tentative hypothesis explaining the epidemiologic findings is the high expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is activated by the viral spike protein in alveolar epithelial cells and myocardium 3 ace2 is a membrane amino-peptide with the catalytic subunit pointed towards the extracellular space of pulmonary cardiac renal and intestinal tissues it functions as an angiotensin ii-degrading enzyme which generates angiotensin 1-7 this latter oligopeptide has vasodilatory hypotensive and diuretic effects 45 so far the binding of covid-19 spike protein to ace2 has been shown to downregulate ace2 and in turn to decrease angiotensin 1-7 production this mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and insufficiency caused by sars-cov-2 infection 6 therefore the different ace2 expression occurring in patients with hypertension cvd or diabetes should be taken into account when the different mortality rate is considered in patients with these comorbidities one of the most frequently reported epidemiologic data is sex-related covid-19 mortality the evidence supports a higher predominance of men in several countries thus the male sex has been considered a poor prognostic factor by some authors 7 male sex represents 73 of deaths in china 8 59 in south korea 9 and in italy iss reports a prevalence of 70 of men among deceased people a recent scoping review on all the available epidemiological studies collecting data from 59254 patients from 11 different countries has shown an association between male sex and higher mortality rate 10 these findings suggest the presence of a male-related susceptibility indeed channappanavar and colleagues 11 have shown that male mice are more susceptible to sars-cov infection than age-matched females this increased susceptibility was associated with high virus titers increased vascular leakage and alveolar edema these changes were accompanied by increased accumulation of inflammatory monocytemacrophages and neutrophils in the lungs of male mice and the depletion of monocytemacrophages partially protected these mice from lethal sars in addition the sex-specific differences were independent of t and b cell responses due to the sex-related intrinsic difference in innate immunity 12 finally ovariectomy or treatment of female mice with an estrogen receptor antagonist increased the mortality rate therefore suggesting a protective effect for the estrogen receptor signaling pathway in sars-cov infected mice 11 in this context the analysis of a possible hormonal-dependency of the expression andor activity of ace2 in the various tissues is of relevance to understand the pathologic mechanisms behind the epidemiologic findings ace2 is expressed in both mouse and human adult leydig cells but in a testosterone-independent manner in these cells the enzyme has been proposed to play a role in steroidogenesis 13 ace2 has also been described in ovarian granulosa cells and its expression increases with a rise in luteinizing hormone lh indeed stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropic hcg improves the ace2-angiotensin 1-7-mas system 14 this may represent a compensatory mechanism that could be useful for avoiding an increase in blood pressure in postmenopausal women 15 in addition to gonadal expression some studies have shown an expression and activity of ace2 influenced by sex hormones in the mouse adipose tissue kidneys and myocardium 15161718 gupte and colleagues studied the contribution of ace2 in the pathogenesis of the sex-related difference of obesity-related hypertension male mice fed with a high-fat diet showed a decreased ace2 expression in the kidney resulting in reduced angiotensin 1-7 and increased angiotensin 1-8 levels this caused blood hypertension that was reversed by the administration of losartan 14 the same authors had previously shown a low expression of ace2 in the adipose tissue of male mice 15 in contrast high-fat-fed female mice have an increased expression of ace2 in the adipose tissue which leads to high angiotensin 1-7 levels and no hypertension until angiotensin 1-7 receptor antagonists are administered ovariectomy results in a decrease ace2 activity in the adipose tissue that leads to hypertension which is restored by 17-estradiol administration 16 in the myocardium ace and ace2 expression as well as cardiac hypertrophy are significantly higher in spontaneously hypertensive male mice compared to female mice after orchiectomy a significant decrease in ace ace2 expression and cardiac hypertrophy was found and consequently an increased cardiac performance was observed finally ovariectomy causes an increase in ace2 expression and cardiac hypertrophy which worsens the function of the heart pump 15 taken together these findings suggest a role of sex hormones in the sex-related expressionfunction of ace2 this may help the interpretation of epidemiologic data more in detail 17-estradiol may increase the expressionactivity of ace2 in the adipose tissue and the kidney as reported above spontaneously hypertensive male mice showed higher ace2 expression than female mice 15 which may provide a possible explanation for the higher mortality in men due to more severe cardiovascular damage that the viral infection is capable of causing since the expression of ace2 in the myocardium appears to be modulated by androgen 15 a role for androgen receptor ar gene polymorphisms cannot be excluded in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular adverse events and hypertension in covid-19-positive male patients another aspect that needs to be highlighted is the increased cvd risk in patients with covid-19 the prevalence of venous thromboembolism vte in these patients has been reported as 25 and vte is associated with an unfavorable prognosis 19 anticoagulant therapy mainly with low molecular weight heparin appears to be associated with a better prognosis in severe covid-19 patients who have sepsis-induced coagulopathy criteria or markedly elevated d-dimer levels 20 the scientific debate regarding the risk of vte in patients treated with testosterone is very current in a recent case-crossover study 39622 men were enrolled and 3110 of them 78 had hypogonadism in age-adjusted models testosterone replacement therapy was associated with a higher risk of vte in men with odds ratio 232 and without odds ratio 202 hypogonadism 21 among the various causes of hypogonadism greater attention should be paid to those forms associated with a greater risk of vte such as in patients with klinefelter syndrome 22 the use of estrogen in women could expose them to the same risk although in these cases the increased awareness of the risk of developing vte is often preceded by appropriate screening another aspect that may explain sex-related susceptibility may relate to vitamin d vitamin d deficiency has been shown to be independently associated with increased risk of viral acute respiratory infection ari in a number of observational studies a meta-analysis of clinical trials on vitamin d supplementation to prevent ari onset has shown moderate protective effects 23 respiratory monocytesmacrophages and epithelial cells constitutively express the vitamin d receptor vdr thereby protecting against respiratory infections interestingly 125oh2-vitamin d3 and other vdr agonists lower significantly the pro-inflammatory response to antigen challenge in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells in vitro some studies suggest that low vitamin d levels may increase the risk or severity of respiratory viral infections and interventional studies have shown that low levels are associated with increased expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines interestingly vitamin d administration decreases the inflammatory response to viral infections in airway epithelium without jeopardizing viral clearance this suggests that adequate vitamin d levels would contribute to reduced inflammation and less severe disease in respiratory syncytial virus-infected individuals 24 it has been known for many years that vitamin d deficiency is not adequately evaluated in older men deficiency 25ohd 20 ngml has been estimated in 26 and insufficiency 30 ngml in 72 in particular the deficiency is common among men during the winter and spring especially in the northern communities and in the oldest and more obese men 25 therefore we speculate that one of the factors involved in this sex-related different susceptibility may due to less vitamin supplementation in men in their sixties compared with age-matched women in conclusion the role of gonadal hormones and possible replacement therapy should be reconsidered in both sexes at this historic moment of sars-cov-2 pandemic testosterone or lhhcg administration could be temporarily discontinued or given at a lower posology in patients with hypogonadism in contrast estrogen replacement therapy may be fully considered in hypogonadal and postmenopausal women furthermore the involvement of the polymorphisms of ar activator and repressor proteins 26 as well as the role of selective androgen receptor modulators 27 as therapeutic agents in men could be deserving of investigation however this relationship is much more complex than it might seem at first glance indeed it should be taken into account that the viral infection itself worsens the function of leydig cells as recently shown in 28 and the consequent hypogonadism exposes the patient to an increased cardiovascular risk and a decreased vitamin d level 2930 close monitoring of serum testosterone levels in these patients would therefore be helpful and should also be continued when the acute phase of the disease has ended it would also be interesting to know the length of active disease for sars-cov-2 patients with or without hypogonadism since hypogonadism can worsen the systemic inflammatory response as demonstrated on peripheral blood leukocytes where testosterone inhibits immune stimuliinduced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf and ifn 31 finally vitamin d deficiency regardless of testosterone levels in elderly men may be worthy of further epidemiological evaluation to better understand the different susceptibility and lethality between sexes  is hypertension a real risk factor for poor prognosis in the covid-19 pandemic luciano drager f andrea pio-abreu renato lopes d luiz bortolotto a   growing evidence suggests the potential involvement of innate natural killer cells and  t cells and adaptive b and t lymphocytes as well as dendritic and monocytemacrophages immune responses in the pathogenesis of hypertension vascular inflammation is the most common pathway favoring arterial remodeling and increased blood pressure 10 11 once activated the immune system seems to play a significant role in the end-organ damage associated with hypertension 1213 overall the contribution of the immune system particularly t-lymphocytes to hypertension is widely accepted but the mechanistic processes preceding activation of immune cells are poorly understood 14 one of the possible mechanisms is related to the increase of sympathetic activation in a complex scenario because sympathoexcitation may induce both suppression or excitatory effects of the t-lymphocytes 14 specifically evidence suggests that increased sympathetic outflow may directly attenuate the ability of naive t-lymphocytes to become fully activated while also exacerbating the inflammatory effects of activated t-lymphocytes 14 however the clinical relevance of these findings is still unclear despite the use of lymphocyte-targeted immunosuppressant drugs shown to attenuate both experimental 15 and human hypertension 16 the lack of robust and consistent data prevents any current indications for treating hypertension with these therapies 8 does the immunology of hypertension fuel a predisposition to infections to the best of our knowledge no large prospective cohorts have shown that patients with hypertension are more susceptible to infection diseases or unfavorable outcomes than observed in normotensive patients another critical concern is related to ace2 a protein that facilitates the entrance of sars-cov-2 into cells 1718 theoretically increased ace2 expression may be potentially harmful for covid-19 infection to date there is no definitive evidence that hypertension is associated with increased ace2 expression and whether this expression may contribute to poor outcomes in covid-19 19 a recent publication found that ace2 expression was elevated in the lungs of patients with covid-19 that presented with comorbidities such as hypertension when compared with control participants 20 however due to the cross-sectional design no cause-effect can be determined while we acknowledge the need for additional research in this area there is no evidence that hypertension per se predisposes patients with covid-19 to a poor prognosis this question has gained a lot of attention in recent weeks because of the potential impact on the management of hypertension recent publications reviewed the role of renin-angiotensin system ras inhibitors in covid-19 infection 21 2223 ace2 an enzyme with a physiological role in ras activity plays a crucial role in covid-19 infection a recent report postulated that the use of ras inhibitors one of the most prescribed classes in hypertension may alter ace2 expression and influence the virulence of covid-19 infection in china 24 however there is no definitive evidence indicating harmful effects of ras inhibitors despite ras inhibitors being recommended as one of the first-line hypertension treatments 8 the use of these drugs in china is quite low and it was estimated that ras inhibitors were used in 2530 of treated patients 25 this flat rate may have implications for the study power of previous reports animal and pre-clinical studies evaluating ace2 levels of expression in different tissues with the use of ras inhibitors have demonstrated conflicting data  21 2223 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors acei do not inhibit ace2 ace and ace2 are different enzymes making the harmful effect of this class unlikely 22 angiotensin ii type 1 receptor blockers arb have been shown to upregulate ace2 in experimental animals 2627 but these findings do not seem to translate into clinical observations including in the setting of covid-19 one of the first reports in humans evaluated 112 patients with covid-19 and previous cardiovascular diseases 28 in this retrospective study from china the use of ras inhibitors was not associated with higher morbidity and mortality 28 more recently 6 observational studies shed some light on this issue and called for more definitive research in this area 29 30 31 32 33 34 a retrospective multicenter analysis of 1128 patients with hypertension diagnosed with covid-19 compared patients taking an aceiarb n  188 with those not taking these drugs n  940 29 in the mixed-effect cox model treating site as a random effect and after adjusting for age sex comorbidities and in-hospital medications the detected risk for all-cause mortality was lower in those taking an aceiarb group versus those not taking an aceiarb fig 1a the results of a propensity score matched analysis performed in a subgroup of patients indicated that use of aceiarbs compared with other antihypertensive drugs was also associated with decreased mortality fig 1b of note the percentage of diuretics and beta-blockers used was higher in patients taking aceiarb which may represent potential residual factors 29 a retrospective single-center study evaluated 126 patients with covid-19 patients and preexisting hypertension at hubei provincial hospital of traditional chinese medicine 30 the patients were allocated to either the aceiarbs group n  43 or the non-aceiarbs group n  83 according to their antihypertensive medication a total of 125 age- and sex-matched covid-19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non-hypertension controls among patients with covid-19 and hypertension those who received either aceiarbs or non-aceiarbs had comparable blood pressure however the aceiarb group had significantly lower concentrations of c-reactive protein and procalcitonin compared with the non-aceiarb group but there were no significant differences in the proportion of critical patients 93 vs 229 p  0061 or rates of death 47 vs 133 p  0216 30 a prospective single center study including 5700 hospitalized patients with covid-19 in the new york city area showed that the mortality rates for patients with hypertension not taking aceis or arbs taking aceis and taking arbs were similar 267 327 and 306 respectively 30 however as noted by the authors the results are unadjusted for known confounders including age sex race ethnicity socioeconomic status indicators and comorbidities such as diabetes chronic kidney disease and heart failure 31 using an observational database from 8910 patients admitted in 169 hospitals in asia europe and north america mehran and colleagues 32 confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease but not hypertension was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death in patients hospitalized with covid-19 no increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ace inhibitors 21 vs 61 odds ratio 033 95 ci 020 to 054 or the use of arbs 68 vs 57 odds ratio 123 95 ci 087 to 174 in a population-based case-control study in the lombardy region of italy including 6272 case patients and 30759 matched beneficiaries of the regional health service controls according to sex age and municipality of residence the use of ace inhibitors and arbs was more frequent in patients with covid-19 than in controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease however there was no evidence that ace inhibitors or arbs was associated with the increased risk of covid-19 33 finally reynolds and colleagues 34 studied the relation between previous treatment with acei arbs beta-blockers calcium-channel blockers or thiazide diuretics and the likelihood of a covid-19 positive test result as well as the infection severity defined as intensive care mechanical ventilation or death in these patients among 12594 patients who were tested for covid-19 they found no significant association between five common classes of antihypertensive medications and a positive test for covid-19 or greater infection severity collectively the available clinical evidence points to a neutral or even beneficial effect on outcomes in patients with covid-19 receiving aceiarb but the observational nature of these investigations prevents any definitive conclusion as previously noted 67 elderly patients are at high risk for complications related to covid-19 and are a group for which social distancing has been identified as a top priority aging is also a well-established risk factor for developing hypertension 8 indeed there is a progressive increase in the prevalence of hypertension in parallel to age stratification 35 according to population statistics the prevalence of hypertension may reach  60 in the elderly 35 in this scenario it is reasonable to expect that hypertension will be a frequent red flag warning in the statistics about complications and deaths from covid-19 7 a recent national analysis from china that included 1590 hospitalized patients from 575 hospitals suggested a potential role of hypertension as an important comorbidity in covid-19 36 the authors evaluated the risk of serious adverse outcomes the composite endpoint consisted of admission to intensive care unit or invasive ventilation or death stratified by comorbidity status after adjusting for age and smoking status chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diabetes malignancy and hypertension were risk factors for the composite endpoint moreover the number of comorbidities also predicted outcomes fig 2 however because comorbidities were self-reported by patients on admission 36 these results should be interpreted with caution it is conceivable that several patients are not aware of their hypertension status supporting this concept 269 patients reported a medical history of hypertension in this investigation 37 which represents 169 which is lower than indicated by the adult population in china 25 indeed for the mean age of patients in the study 48 years the prevalence of hypertension in china is 296 25 therefore reports to date have not rigorously accounted for age or other key factors that contribute to health as potential confounders in risk prediction 21 the relevance of discussing and investigating whether hypertension is or is not a prognostic marker in the covid-19 pandemic is clear from the epidemiologiceconomic perspective it is crucial to stablish the real risk factors for priorities from social distancing regardless of their age even in several strategic areas including healthcare professionals in this scenario future investigations addressing the impact of hypertension on prognosis may have significant value when adopting a strict protocol to confirm the hypertension status medications under chronic use and associated comorbidities including overweightobesity reported by some investigations as a predictor of poor outcomes in covid-19 2837 and chronic kidney and pulmonary disease we share the opinion that not only age but also other relevant variables should be adjusted for to clarify the potential role of hypertension as an independent risk factor in the covid-19 from the treatment perspective it is important to determine the role of hypertension treatments such as aceiarbs on the susceptibility to viral infections particular attention should be devoted to the role of ace2 overexpression in these patients in this sense recombinant ace2 gene-delivery of ace2 angiotensin 17 analogs and g-coupled protein receptor of angiotensin- 17 mas receptor agonists enhance ace2 action and may serve as potential target therapies but relevant studies in humans are lacking 23 we also need definitive evidence regarding the use of ras inhibitors during covid-19 infection currently there are 5 ongoing randomized trials registered with clinicaltrialsgov aiming to test the impact of acei andor arbs in patients with covid-19 table 1 four of them are focusing on the safety issues of these classes in the acute phase 3 studies and in the chronic scenario 1 study interestingly the praetorian-covid trial is testing whether an arb valsartan may be protective in patients with severe covid-19 without hypertension the rationale for this study is based on the assumption that during acute lung injury the alveolar ace2 appears to be downregulated 38 arbs would truly upregulate membrane-bound ace2 thereby supporting a protective rather than deleterious effect in covid-19 taken together the evidence so far is unclear about whether hypertension or its treatment is a real risk factor in covid-19 infection future investigations are necessary to clarify this complex and multifaceted puzzle  pathological role of angiotensin ii in severe covid-19 wolfgang miesbach   
coronavirus disease covid-19 is a recent pandemic infection caused by an enveloped nonsegmented single-stranded ribonucleic acid rna- coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus
1
that can cause various symptoms ranging from a mild cold to severe respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers with mortality rates of 10 for sars and 37 for mers
2
 in recent years two other coronary viral infections have spread and led to severe respiratory diseases sars and mers 
sars-cov first appeared 18 years ago
3
during the sars epidemic in 2002 more than 8000 infected patients of all ages and 744 deaths were documented in 26 countries on 5 continents the main clinical manifestations were upper respiratory symptoms rapid progression of pneumonia and approximately 20 to 30 had to be admitted to intensive care
4
in patients over 65 years of age the mortality rate was over 50 of the patients treated or dying in the intensive care unit 114 developed disseminated intravascular coagulation
 
covid-19 is characterized by an exaggerated inflammatory response that can lead to severe complications acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and sepsis shortly after the onset of symptoms
5
thrombotic events and coagulopathy have also been described in covid-19
6
 
the transition from mild to severe in patients with covid-19 can be rapid without predicting symptoms and older male and obese patients with comorbidities have a higher risk of developing severe symptoms
7
 
acute lung failure is a pathology of many diseases and a combination of antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments is recommended for covid-19
8
unfortunately no specific drug or vaccine has yet been approved for the treatment of human coronavirus
 therefore the underlying pathomechanism of covid-19-induced changes should be investigated to identify specific treatment options 
of the total of 44672 cases of covid-19 published by the chinese centre for disease control and prevention 81 had mild symptoms 14 severe and 5 critical manifestations
9
the case fatality rate was 23 and 148 in patients aged 80 older patients and patients with comorbidities and higher body mass index are more likely to have serious complications of covid-19 severe and critical cases suffer from sepsis and ards and coagulopathy occurs in 50 of cases
10
 
sepsis cytokine storm and viral bypassing of the cellular immune response have been described in connection with human coronavirus infections
11
12
associated with neutrophilia and pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in respiratory syndromes
13
14
 
pulmonary symptoms and pneumonia are predominant in covid-19
15
pneumonia can be complicated by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction which is a homeostatic reflex contraction of the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle in response to low regional oxygen partial pressure that redirects blood to more oxygenated lung segments
16
in a study using remdesivir a nucleoside analogue drug that inhibits viral rna polymerases there is a mortality rate of 18 in ventilated covid-19 patients
17
 
sepsis is the most common cause of acute lung injury and ards
18
ards is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage and is often complicated by pulmonary hypertension
19
in patients with ards a subgroup of ards survivors develop a fibroproliferative response characterized by fibroblast accumulation and deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix components in the lung the development of severe fibroproliferative lung disease is associated with a poor prognosis with high mortality andor prolonged ventilator dependence
20
 
all patients with severe complications experienced extrapulmonary symptoms and organ injuries in a multivariable analysis comparing clinical and laboratory parameters of 137 surviving patients from 54 nonsurvivors death occurred median on the 18th day of hospital treatment after mechanical ventilation for 145 days
10
in three patients an attempt was made to perform extracorporeal membrane oxygenation all 54 deceased patients developed sepsis 100 vs 42 of survivors 53 patients suffered from respiratory failure 98 vs 36 50 patients suffered from ards 93 vs 7 28 patients suffered from heart failure 52 vs 12 and 38 patients suffered from septic shock 70 vs 0 the rate of patients with organ injury was significantly higher in patients with severe outcome of 54 patients 32 patients had a heart injury 25 had heart failure and 27 had a kidney injury
 
in china several studies investigated the clinical course of covid-19 differentiating between severe and nonsevere outcome and collecting data on organ injury in 6 studies the clinical course of 1841 patients was investigated 21 of whom developed a severe manifestation of the disease
7
10
12
21
22
23
median age ranged from 49 to 715 years and was up to 285 years older than in patients with nonsevere course male patients were more affected by severe manifestations from 578 to 78 all patients with severe manifestations had organ injuries up to 55 heart injuries and up to 50 kidney injuries 
table 1

 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is critical for heart function angiotensin ii ang ii infusions in mice resulted in increased blood pressure myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis whereas these effects could be counteracted with recombinant human ace2
24
loss of ace2 can further exacerbate cardiac damage
25
 
myocardial infarction appears to be an important complication of the disease which according to chen et al was also found in the autopsy of a 53-year-old female patient
5
in a meta-analysis cardiac troponin i levels are significantly increased in patients with severe covid-19 infection compared with patients with milder forms of the disease
26
 
cardiac injury has been shown in a cross-sectional study with 150 patients included 126 mild and 24 severe cases
5
and has been confirmed as common condition among hospitalized patients associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality
27
of a total of 416 patients 197 had cardiac injury and highly significant elevated levels of high-sensitive troponin i levels the mortality of these patients was significantly higher with 512 than those without cardiac injury 45
 laboratory and imaging findings suggest an increased risk of thrombotic events in patients with covid-19 infection but the incidence of thrombosis in patients with covid-19 has not been determined 
coagulopathy has been described in up to 50 of severe manifestations of covid-19 it has been shown that increased d-dimers measured at hospital admission can predict the severe course of covid-19
10
d-dimer derives from the cleavage of cross-linked fibrin and reflects both thrombin production and activation of fibrinolysis besides the known variability in healthy subjects and its tendency to increase with age there is an association of increased d-dimer levels and fibrin degradation products under all conditions with an activated coagulation system such as thrombosis infection or malignancy
28
a large study included 1099 covid positive patients from 552 hospitals in china d-dimer levels above the threshold of 05 gl were detected in 464 of patients 60 among them developed severe manifestations in these patients d-dimer levels were fourfold increased at 212 ugml 077527 compared with nonsevere patients 061 ugml 035129 interestingly none of the nonsevere patients had d-dimer levels increasing more than three times at admission
7
 
in a study of 184 critically ill patients with covid-19 from 3 dutch hospitals there was a 31 incidence of thrombosis instead of the use of standard doses of thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin the majority of patients suffered from lung embolism but stroke also occurred in three patients
29
 
in addition microthrombosis was described in a case series of four autopsies of covid-19 infected patients from new orleans with sudden respiratory decompensation the autopsy findings showed small vessels with thromboembolism and small thrombi together with scattered areas of diffuse alveolar damage these findings usually worsened the course of the disease and could hardly be diagnosed early the d-dimers found at the time of death were elevated in only two patients which shows that microthrombosis does not usually lead to generalized coagulation activation
30
 
the reninangiotensin system ras was first described more than 40 years ago and has led to a broader understanding of cardiovascular pathophysiology
31
the ras is known for its role in the regulation of blood pressure electrolyte balance and vascular remodeling
32
continuous basic and clinical research has enabled significant advances in therapy and developed the treatment of hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction as well as severe heart failure
 
renin is released by the kidney in response to renal hypoperfusion reduced sodium intake and sympathetic activation a cascade of proteolytic reactions leads to the formation of ang peptides with different functions the ace is a zinc-dependent peptidase responsible for the conversion of ang i into vasoconstrictive ang ii ace2 counteracts the activity of ace by reducing the amount of ang ii increasing ang

and cleaving ang i to ang

and thereby attenuating the effects of ang ii the ras produces opposite effects and ang
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
directly antagonizes the effects of ang ii and mediates vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects because it induces the release of nitric oxide and prostaglandin i2 after stimulation of the endothelial at2 receptor
33
34
 
ace2 is expressed predominantly by vascular endothelial cells of the lung but also of extrapulmonary tissue heart nervous system intestine kidneys blood vessels and muscles on cell surfaces
35
36
 
in addition ace2 has functions that are independent of ras in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that ace2 acts as a functional sars-cov-2 receptor as well as the transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 which is required for host cell entry and subsequent viral replication
37
 
remarkably the sars-cov-2 protein recognizes human ace2 with an even higher binding affinity than the spike of sars-cov
38
preclinical studies have shown that after binding of sars-cov to its receptor ace2 activates ras leading to downregulation of the expression of ace2 which in turn results in excessive production of ang ii
39
40
41
42
 therefore ace2 plays a dual role in covid-19 initially it acts as a receptor for sars-cov-2 entry then in the context of sars-cov-2 infection ace2 is downregulated which increases ang ii 
ang ii is the central effector molecule of activated ras elevated levels of ang ii have been reported mostly in patients with hypertension and heart failure indicating the benefit of ras inhibitors
43
 
there are two ang ii receptors type 1 and type 2 which indicate the effect of ras inhibitors
43
most cardiovascular effects of ang ii are attributed to the type 1 receptor
 
notably ang ii is one of the most potent vasopressors known when linked to its type 1 ang receptor the vasopressor effects of ang ii were investigated in a multinational double-blind randomized controlled trial athos-3 in 163 patients with vasodilatory shock
44
ang ii effectively raised blood pressure in patients with vasodilatory shock who did not respond to high doses of conventional vasopressors however a high rate of thrombosis was observed in 129 of patients and the use of thromboprophylaxis was recommended
45
interestingly skin problems possibly caused by thrombosis of small vessels were also observed
 
there is evidence for the important role of ang ii in vascular cell growth and tissue remodeling after hypertension vascular injury heart failure and atherosclerosis
46
47
 
recently ang ii has been shown to stimulate the production of pulmonary fibroblast procollagen via the at1 receptor in lung injury
48
in addition ang ii promotes the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells vsmcs which induces cellular hypertrophy in the pathology of hypertension and atherosclerosis
 
ang ii contributes to endothelial dysfunction the development of arteriosclerosis and microvascular thrombosis ang ii stimulates tissue factor tf expression both in vitro and in vivo
49
tf is the physiological initiator of blood coagulation and as a consequence of its activation tf becomes dominant over tf pathway inhibitor resulting in prothrombotic endothelium in addition ang ii stimulates platelet-derived growth factor production and increases platelet aggregation arterial thrombotic events such as stroke or myocardial infarction are associated with increased platelet aggregation
50
 
in addition to that endothelial microparticles which are key players in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases inflammation coagulation and angiogenesis are increased in many age-related vascular diseases such as coronary artery disease but also stimulated by ang ii
51
 
it has also been shown that ang ii infusion leads to abnormal inflammatory and thrombotic reactions in the microcirculation in hypertensive rats ang ii accelerates arterial thrombosis of the carotid artery via the at1 receptor
52
 
the prothrombogenic effects are not restricted to large arteries there is also accelerated microvascular thrombosis in arterioles and to a lesser extent in venules after ang ii infusions
53
 
clinical data also support the role of ang ii in fibrinolysis plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 pai-1 is the major inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system and elevated levels have been found to be associated with coronary artery disease deep vein thrombosis and malignancy
54
mature fat cells are an important source of pai-1 and its expression correlates with visceral fat mass in vitro and vivo studies have shown that ang ii stimulates the expression and release of pai-1 ang ii also stimulates the expression of pai-1 messenger rna mrna in endothelial cells and increases plasma pai-1 levels in a dose-dependent manner the infusion of ang ii in healthy volunteers led to a significant increase in pai-1 concentrations
55
 
in the heart study pai-1 concentrations were significantly lower when administering both ramipril and captopril
56
both of which can suppress the formation of ang ii in adipose tissue
54
 
in addition inhalation of plasminogen whose conversion to plasmin is inhibited by pai-1 improves lung lesions and hypoxemia in patients with covid-19
57
 
there is an association between activated ras increased ang ii and inflammatory cytokine expression and activation ang ii has proinflammatory properties including the increase of interleukin il-6 which was demonstrated after infusion of ang ii in healthy controls
58
furthermore ang ii has been shown to induce il-6 transcription in vsmc
59
in vsmc the expression of il-6 could be induced by ang ii
60
which may explain the underlying mechanism in the progression of ang ii-induced atherosclerosis
 
il-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that mediates the proliferation of b-lymphocytes during antibody synthesis ang ii stimulates the release of il-6 contributing to cytokine storm and poorer outcomes in patients with covid-19
59
 
the function of ace2 has also been demonstrated in an ace2 knockout mouse model the loss of ace2 expression preceded acute lung damage in various models ace2 knockout mice showed more severe lung damage caused by increased hydrostatic pressure reduced perfusion and severe pulmonary edema
41
administration of recombinant ace2 protects the lungs from severe lung damage consequently ang ii is directly associated with lung tissue damage and ace2 is inversely associated with lung tissue damage
 
organ damage to the lung heart and kidney is a major cause of severe clinical manifestations in covid patients already in 2005 ace2 was shown to protect the mouse lungs from ards in ace2 knockout mice in particular the injection of sars-cov spikes into mice exacerbates acute lung failure in vivo which can be attenuated by blocking the reninangiotensin signaling pathway suggesting that activation of pulmonary ras influences the pathogenesis of ards and sars
39
41
in autopsies of patients who died from sars 35 of heart samples showed the presence of sars-cov associated with reduced ace2 expression
61
 
remarkably the unbalanced ras was found in covid-19 patients in an investigation of epidemiological clinical laboratory chemical and radiological characteristics and potential biomarkers to predict disease severity in 2019-ncov-infected patients in shenzhen ang ii levels in the plasma sample of 2019-ncov-infected patients were shown to be significantly elevated and linearly associated with viral load and lung damage in critically ill patients
62
 
table 2
summarizes the possible effects of ang ii on the clinical symptoms of covid-19 patients the complex clinical picture of patients with severe complications of covid-19 is triggered by the different effects of highly expressed ang ii on vasculopathy coagulopathy and inflammation
 
it could be shown that patients with covid-19 have an unbalanced ras with highly expressed ang levels in addition the presence of comorbidities such as arterial hypertension is significantly associated with a worse outcome of a total of 1430 patients in 3 studies hypertension was common in up to 48 of patients and there were significantly more severe manifestations in 36 to 48 of patients compared with severe manifestations in 14 to 24 of patients without hypertension 
table 3

 
the presence of hypertension is associated with significantly higher mortality the odds ratio for mortality in hypertension is between 170 092313

however the data were not adjusted to other risk factors and it became not clear from the studies whether the hypertension was previously known or was only diagnosed during the hospital stay and whether treatment for example with ras-inhibiting drugs was administered
 
therefore ras-inhibiting drugs such as ace inhibitors aceis or angiotensin receptor blockers arbs may be used in covid-19-infected patients to treat hypertension and other ang ii-related complications a preclinical study showed that arb drugs especially losartan are effective in relieving acute lung injury caused by sars-cov in mice
62
 
however acei and arb have shown an increase in ace2 expression in heart tissue in animal models
63
there is concern that a possible higher expression of pulmonary membrane-bound ace2 which has not been confirmed to date may lead to easier entry of the virus into respiratory cells when ras-inhibiting drugs are taken
 
on the other hand both acei lisinopril and arb losartan can upregulate cardiac ace2 mrna by a factor of 3 to 4 in an animal model the acei enalapril attenuated the downregulation of cardiac ace2 after myocardial infarction
64
65
 
there is a clear benefit of acei and arb in reducing thrombotic effects in hypertensive patients
66
67
protection against severe lung damage could also be achieved by administering recombinant ace2 ace2 knockout mice showed more severe lung damage caused by increased hydrostatic pressure reduced perfusion and severe pulmonary edema
41
administration of recombinant ace2 protects the lungs from severe lung damage consequently ang ii is directly associated with lung tissue damage and ace2 is inversely associated with lung tissue damage
 
recently it could be shown that human recombinant soluble ace2 can block early stages of sars-cov-2 infections
68
and could in the future also be used to treat covid-19 patients which is currently being tested in a phase 2 clinical trial
 
currently numerous drugs are studied in clinical trials a small cohort of critically ill patients was treated with remdesivir a nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral rna polymerases and a clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients 68
17
randomized controlled trials are ongoing and will soon provide more evidence of the safety and efficacy of remdesivir for covid-19
 
finally considering covid-19 as a procoagulant disease prophylactic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin should be initiated as soon as possible to prevent thrombotic events and to counteract the proinflammatory influence of cytokines
69
 the transition from mild to severe symptoms can occur rapidly in patients with covid-19 without predicting signals and older male and obese patients with comorbidities have a higher risk of developing severe symptoms the ras plays an important role in covid-19 ace2 acts as functional sars-cov-2 receptor which leads to a downregulation of ace2 and a higher expression of ang ii ace2 is predominantly expressed by vascular endothelial cells of the lung but also in extrapulmonary tissue heart nervous system intestine kidneys blood vessels and muscles on cell surfaces which may explain the multiorgan dysfunction observed in patients with covid-19 the complex clinical picture of patients with severe complications of covid-19 includes pneumonia ards sepsis coagulopathy high rate of thrombosis and organ damage and is triggered by various effects of highly expressed ang ii on vasculopathy coagulopathy and inflammation the combination of numerous pathophysiological changes caused by ang ii in covid-19 could explain the rapid development of severe patients and why older and obese patients are particularly affected future treatment options should focus on blocking the thrombogenic and inflammatory properties of ang ii in covid-19 patients  covid-19-associated cardiovascular morbidity in older adults a position paper from the italian society of cardiovascular

december 2019 and known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 sars-cov-2 rapidly spread throughout all chinese provinces and subsequently propagated across the globe with more than 700000 cases and  30000 deaths in 202 countries httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports the world health organization who has therefore declared coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as global pandemic on march 12 2020 europe is now the worlds covid-19 epicenter with italy being the country with the highest number of reported cases and deaths as of march 29 the italian institute of health iss reported 89967 cases and 9200 deaths in italy httpswwwepicentroissitcoronavirus which overtook china as the country with most coronavirus-related casualties the pandemic is now propagating across usa where over 100000 cases and 2000 deaths were reported as of march 29 2020 currently sars-cov-2 presents an estimated r0 ranging between 2 and 3 which means that any infected individual may transmit the disease to other 23 people in a susceptible population madjid et al 2020 such as older adults dadamo et al 2020 and those suffering from multiple comorbidities sars-cov-2 an enveloped positive-strand rna virus that belongs to the -coronavirus -cov family presents  80 nucleotide identity with the sars-like covzxc21 identified in bats and with human sars-cov while nucleotide identity with mers-cov is reduced to  50 chan et al 2020 wan et al 2020 lu et al 2020 sars-cov-2 mainly targets the respiratory tract of mammals including humans thereby inducing a wide spectrum of clinical features ranging from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms to interstitial pneumonia or upon progressive alveolar damage severe acute respiratory failure which may require advanced respiratory support and intensive care of two or more organ systems in fact covid-19 may progress towards adult respiratory distress syndrome ards andor multiple organ acute failure eg kidney liver and heart and even death huang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020b wu et al 2020a wang et al 2020d although covid-19 is a respiratory disease one third of patients with more severe covid-19 had conjunctivitis wu et al 2020b and some patients showed gastrointestinal symptoms nausea vomiting or diarrhea jin et al 2020 interestingly epithelial cells of several body compartments including oral xu et al 2020a and nasal mucosa hamming et al 2004 respiratory tree and alveoli hamming et al 2004 intestinal mucosa hamming et al 2004 as well as human aqueous humor holappa et al 2015 show high levels of a metallopeptidase named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is the functional receptor for sars-cov2 lan et al 2020 ace2 is also expressed in coronary and intrarenal endothelial cells and in renal tubular epithelial cells donoghue et al 2000 since ace2 catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensin ii a vasoconstrictor into angiotensin 17 ang 17 a vasodilator its extra-respiratory localization has supported hypotheses on the relationship of sars-cov-2 infection with the cardiovascular cv system indeed adult patients affected by cvds arterial hypertension diabetes andor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd show worse clinical outcome following contraction of the viral illness with fatality rate attaining 105 the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team and novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team 2020 in patients with covid-19 pneumonia who developed ards acute cardiac injury shock and arrhythmia represent the most common life-threatening complications along with acute kidney injury chen et al 2020b huang et al 2020 wang et al 2020a it has long been known that acute respiratory infections including flu and pneumonias may trigger severe cv disease cvd events and vice versa madjid et al 2020 although experimental evidence on this topic is still at its infancy we will hypothesize and discuss more suggestive cellular and molecular mechanisms whereby sars-cov-2 may lead to detrimental consequences to the cv system we will focus on aging cytokine storm nlrp3inflammasome hypoxemia and air pollution which is an emerging cv risk factor associated with rapid urbanization and globalization we will finally discuss the impact of clinically available cv drugs on the clinical course of covid-19 patients understanding the role played by sars-cov2 on the cv system is indeed mandatory to get further insights into covid-19 pathogenesis and to design a therapeutic strategy of cardio-protection for frail patients zheng et al 2020 first reports describing the clinical features of patients affected by covid-19 hinted at a relationship between sars-cov-2-mediated infection and the cv system mainly due to the high inflammatory burden affecting myocardium and vessels table 1 zheng et al 2020 madjid et al 2020 although it is a suggestive causal relationship more translational research should be carefully performed in order to avoid confounding factors and hasty conclusions in order to support it we will mention the clinical evidences as they emerged to best of our knowledge the prevalence and risk of death of severe covid-19 is higher in elderly patients with chronic comorbidities such as arterial hypertension type 2 diabetes cardiac and cerebrovascular disorders and copd wang et al 2020b of note diagnosis of major cardiac complications ie acute myocardial injury and lethal arrhythmias recently emerged from analysis of initial representative populations of covid-19 patients the first report analyzed a cohort of 41 patients median age  49 years 73 men the majority of whom n  27 66 were exposed to huanan seafood and live-animal market huang et al 2020 the original epicenter of covid-19 outbreak underlying comorbidities were reported in 32 of the patients including diabetes n  8 20 cvd n  6 15 and hypertension n  6 15 huang et al 2020 moreover increased blood levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i ctni were reported in 5 patients 12 huang et al 2020 this initial finding cautiously suggests the onset of acute cardiac ischemic injury in covid-19 patients yet measurements of ctni levels should be always associated to electrocardiogram ecg or imaging findings of myocardial ischemia giannitsis and katus 2013 to make a diagnosis intriguingly rising levels of ctni are also independent predictors of mortality in critically ill patients hospitalized with severe pneumonia without evidence of acute coronary syndrome lee et al 2015 in this regard we cannot exclude the onset of transient myopericarditis mimicking acute myocardial infarction in severe covid-19 patients due to cytokine storm inciardi et al 2020 as previously observed in severe ards patients to et al 2010 in fact an increased serum level of pro-inflammatory cytokines for instance interleukin-1 il-1 interferon  ifn and mcp1 was reported in both icu-patients and non-icu patients this observation is consistent with the development of a cytokine storm syndrome as previously reported in sars sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infections de wit et al 2016 a second report analyzed a cohort of 99 patients median age  555 67 men the half of which n  49 49 was also exposed to huanan seafood market chen et al lancet 2020b a large percentage of these subjects n  40 40 each suffered of cvd and cerebrovascular disorders which represent the most common chronic comorbidities in this cohort chen et al 2020b cardiac injury was diagnosed by measuring changes in myocardial zymogram which evaluates the activity of metalloproteinases myocardial zymogram results however are at risk of being over-interpreted since the assay is a timp tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases free environment lindsey 2018 since it is not considered a gold standard assay to diagnose acute cardiac injury in hospital setting other established cardiac specific biomarkers should be tested in fact the authors have also reported high circulating levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in 13 13 and 75 76 patients respectively chen et al 2020b which are biomarkers generally used to perform early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction yet since these enzymes are also present in other tissues than the myocardium their diagnostic specificity is limited and their diagnostic sensitivity also suffers from the presence of a sizeable baseline enzyme concentration in the circulation without any cardiac pathology bodor 2016 false-positive results indeed may occur in renal failure muscle fatigue vitamin d deficiency pneumonia asthma malignancies pulmonary embolism hypoxia and smokers in particular 2 of the dead patients presented a long history of tobacco smoke exposure chen et al 2020b which enhances the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular disease as well a third report analyzed a cohort of 138 patients median age  56 543 men with hypertension n  43 312 cvd n  20 145 diabetes n  14 101 and cancer n  10 72 as more common coexisting underlying comorbidities wang et al 2020a while a small fraction of subjects n  7 51 was suffering from cerebrovascular disease wang et al 2020a of note the admission rate to icu n  36 261 was remarkably increased among patients of the same age displaying hypertension n  21 583 cvd n  9 25 and cerebrovascular disease n  6 167 as underlying comorbidities wang et al 2020a finally arrhythmias n  23 167 and acute cardiac injury n  10 72 defined as increased blood levels of hypersensitive ctni were the most common complications arising in icu patients affected by ards n  27 196 and acute kidney injury n  5 36 wang et al 2020a a fourth single-center study analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of 140 hospitalized covid-19 patients median age  57 507 men none of whom was exposed to huanan market ninety patients 643 suffered from at least 1 underlying comorbidity the most common being hypertension n  42 30 followed by diabetes n  17 121 of note a lower fraction of severe covid-19 patients suffered from preexisting arrhythmia n  5 36 and coronary heart disease n  7 5 zhang et al 2020 finally a single-center large study conducted on 1099 patients affected by covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 chinese provinces median age  47 581 men confirmed that 237 subjects had pre-existing comorbidities guan et al 2020 such as hypertension n  165 15 diabetes n  81 74 coronary heart disease n  27 25 and cerebrovascular disease n  15 14 guan et al 2020 in this study acute cardiac injury was defined by the increase in circulating levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in 137 and 410 of the patients respectively guan et al 2020 no additional features of acute myocardial infarction were considered among different clinical reports a retrospective multicenter cohort study including 191 adult covid-19 patients median age  56 62 men confirmed preexisting comorbidities in almost half of the individuals n  91 48 such as hypertension n  58 30 diabetes n  36 19 and coronary heart disease n  15 8 zhou et al 2020a likewise non-survivors displayed a higher rate of comorbidities as compared to survivors including hypertension 48 vs 23 diabetes 31 vs 14 and coronary heart disease 24 vs 1 zhou et al 2020a in addition to sepsis n  112 59 respiratory failure n  103 54 ards n  59 31 and acute kidney injury n  28 15 the most common secondary outcomes in this cohort of patients were the onset of acute heart failure n  44 23 and acute cardiac injury n  33 17 zhou et al 2020a of note non-survivors presented higher rates of acute heart failure 52 vs 12 and acute cardiac injury 59 vs 1 as compared to survivors moreover laboratory findings showed high levels of nonspecific biomarkers as lactate dehydrogenase creatine kinase and hypersensitive ctni which has an amino acid sequence similar to skeletal troponin c xu et al 2013 and pro-inflammatory biomarkers eg interleukin-6 il-6 and serum ferritin zhou et al 2020a again since measurement of circulating biomarkers is not enough to diagnose acute cardiac injury caused by sars-cov2 with certainty further clinical investigations based on multimodal approach should be encouraged similarly a retrospective multicenter study conducted on a smaller cohort n  150 of covid-19 patients confirmed that risk of death was greater in the presence of cvd of note isolated myocardial injury resulted to be one of the main causes of death in some patients 7 in the presence of high levels of il-6 and c-reactive protein the relationship between sars-cov-2 infection and cvd has been further corroborated by a recent descriptive analysis of all the 44672 covid-19 cases diagnosed in china as of february 11 2020 the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team and novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team 2020 this study confirmed that a fraction of patients was affected by cvd 142 including arterial hypertension 128 although retrospective studies cannot be helpful to made a causal association it further confirmed that the mortality rate was increased by cvd  105 diabetes  73 chronic respiratory disease  63 and arterial hypertension  6 the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team and novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team 2020 madjid et al 2020 do these cvds really make a difference in the worse prognosis of covid-19 patients although italy is the european country with the highest percentage of the population aged 80 or over and with the mortality rate due to covid-19 among the highest in the world madjid et al 2020 it is still unknown whether greater vulnerability to illness depends on higher percentage of older patients meanwhile the iss recently listed the most common comorbidities observed in deceased patients in italy as of march 26 2020 table 2 only 16 of screened patients had no comorbidities while majority of patients presented one 235 two 266 three or more 486 comorbidities finally we can assume that clinical outcome of covid-19 has progressively worsened in most italian elderly patients due to the combined impact of multiple comorbidities and frailty since cardiometabolic disease is most common in people over 50 and risk of developing it increases as people get older it is conceivable that underlying cv and metabolic comorbidities ie hypertension ischemic heart disease atrial fibrillation stroke and diabetes contribute to unfavorable prognosis in older covid-19 patients in addition 101 patients died because of acute myocardial injury httpswwwepicentroissitcoronavirussars-cov-2-decessi-italia these first independent analyses suggest that besides arising more frequently in individuals suffering from underlying cv comorbidities sars-cov-2 may cause severe myocardial injury even in the absence of ards or multiple organ dysfunctions often leading to death besides local ischemia fatal myocardial damage in covid-19 patients may be due to acute myocarditis unresponsive to conventional therapy recently the autopsy of a male covid-19 patient revealed myocardial infiltration by interstitial mononuclear inflammatory cells xu et al 2020b evidence for severe myocarditis associated to low cardiac output syndrome was even observed in some covid-19 patients in both italy inciardi et al 2020 and china hu et al 2020 these findings are consistent with the reported upregulation of il-6 in the serum of covid-19 patients as chronic il-6 production during viral infection has long been known to boost myocarditis fontes et al 2015 however further investigation about underlying mechanisms is required although well-known epidemic viruses ie sars-cov mers-cov and flu viruses influenza a or b virus may lead to arrhythmia myocardial infarction and acute heart failure through aberrant systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines we cannot exclude that other factors activated by sars-cov2 exacerbate the cardiac injury characterizing covid-19 herein we will analyze the potential role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 pathway nlrp3inflammasome hypoxemia aging and air pollution ras activity is known to be elevated in lung tissues in fact the endothelium of the pulmonary vessels is an important site of ace and is therefore one of the main sources of systemic ang ii ace2 is also strongly expressed in the lung and upper airway pulmonary ace2 may play a role in regulating the balance of circulating levels of ang iiang 17 of note ang ii contributes to pulmonary vasoconstriction in response to hypoxia an important pathophysiological mechanism useful to prevent shunt in patients with lung injury or pneumonia however the local increase in ang ii levels increases vascular permeability thus promoting the onset of pulmonary edema in ards ras appears crucial in maintaining oxygenation lionetti et al 2005 ace2 knockout mice showed more severe symptoms than wild-type mice kiely et al 1997 imai et al 2005 while overexpression appears protective a correlation between an ace polymorphism and ards severity has been described in humans matsuda et al 2012 in acute lung injury ace ang ii and the at1 receptor function as factors that promote lung injury oudit et al 2009 despite having normal lung structure and function ace2 knockout mice show a very serious pathology in case of ardsacute lung damage compared to wild-type mice since ace2 plays an important anti-inflammatory role ace2 knockout mice are characterized by increased vascular permeability pulmonary edema and neutrophil accumulation in some recent studies ace2 protects against pulmonary vasoconstriction chronic pulmonary lesions and fibrosis moreover ace2 inhibits neutrophil infiltration and lung inflammation by limiting il-17 signaling and by reducing the activity of the stat3 pathway in response to bacterial infection in rats sodhi et al 2019 therefore ace2 has been proposed as a new therapeutic target for acute lung injury chronic lung disease and bacterial pneumonia as well indeed the efficacy of recombinant soluble human ace2 protein on acute respiratory failure is currently being studied in humans in a phase ii clinical trial kuba et al 2013 in addition some drugs have been developed to increase pulmonary ace2 expression such as anti-diabetic glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor glp-1r agonist liraglutide in order to improve lung function by normalizing expression of surfactant protein a and b roman-prez et al 2015 which is reduced in patients with severe viral pneumonia kerr and paton 1999 ace and ace2 are highly expressed in the adult kidney even if in different areas ace2 is mainly expressed in the proximal tubule on the edge of the brush while ace seems to be evenly distributed on the apical and the basolateral membrane of the polarized cells of the tubules interestingly both renal development and kidney function are normal in the ace2 knockout mouse crackower et al 2002 however angiotensinogen ace and at1 receptor lack results in a series of alterations in kidney morphology therefore ace2 has a marginal role in regulating renal function at least in the healthy state however the action of ace2 is critical during ras activation in fact ang 17 exerts very limited renal effects in the healthy state but it plays profound beneficial effects in diabetic patients and in other states associated with renal damage for instance ace2 deficiency in mouse models is associated to increased age-related glomerulosclerosis and enhanced ang ii-induced renal oxidative stress leading to greater renal injury in particular downregulation of tubular ace2 is associated with albuminuria or tubular injury in the diabetic kidney where further inhibition of ace2 results in augmented renal damage doan et al 2001 li et al 2005 oudit et al 2006 wong et al 2007 soler et al 2007 hence ace2 is proving to be a protective molecule against kidney disease especially in the context of a negative regulation of classical ras axis deletion of ace2 leads to spontaneous late-onset nephrotic glomerulosclerosis and accelerates diabetic kidney injury indeed glomerular disease and albuminuria occur after pharmacological inhibition of ace2 soler et al 2013 note that in several forms of chronic kidney disease and especially in diabetes it has been found that tubular ace2 expression is reduced however other studies showed that glomerular expression of ace2 increases in acute kidney injury it is likely that differential expression pattern of tubular and glomerular ace2 may be an important determinant for determining the progression of kidney disease kuba et al 2013 in some cardiac resident cells ie endothelial cells pericytes and cardiomyocytes ace2 is the main enzyme involved in the local clearance of ang ii previous experimental evidences indicate that ace2 is an essential regulator of cardiac function and is involved in the response of various cardiac cells to multiple injuries especially those associated with overactivation of classical ras pathway imai et al 2005 in different experimental models indeed ace2 deficiency induces progressive cardiac fibrosis with aging andor pressure overload moreover ace2 deficiency accelerates post-infarct adverse ventricular remodeling and causes early cardiac hypertrophy in mice these detrimental effects may be prevented or reversed following treatment with ace inhibitors or at1 receptor blockers or sartans on the other hand ang17 peptide treatment can hamper cardiac remodeling and improve myocardial performance and even survival in rodent heart failure models schindler et al 2007 furthermore the use of mas receptor selective ligands such as ave-0991 exerts cardioprotective effects similar to ang17 in ischemiareperfusion ir injury myocardial infarction zeng et al 2012 or hypertension-induced cardiomyopathy models ferreira et al 2007 these observations suggest that the altered balance between ace and ace2 in the cv system is a critical driver for progressive heart disease which can be reverted by inhibiting classical ace or upregulating ace2 pathway however it is still unknown how myocardial ace2 may worsen covid-19 clinical scenario or contribute to vulnerability to sars-cov2 infection at least patients with cvds are at higher risk for severe covid-19 and show a worse prognosis in the presence of a systemic inflammatory response and immune system deregulation zheng et al 2020 madjid et al 2020 so far it is unclear whether cardiac ace2 signaling may play a role in cardiac injury yet the following clinical evidences will be helpful to support next focused investigations firstly since epithelial ace2 is the gateway of sars-cov-2 entry into cells the attractive hypothesis that sars-cov-2 may directly affect myocardial tissue through ace2 of endothelial cells pericytes or cardiomyocytes cannot be discounted a priori in agreement with this hypothesis preliminary reports provided evidence of symptoms of myocarditis in covid-19 patients xu et al 2020b ruan et al 2020b hu et al 2020 inciardi et al 2020 which is also consistent with the rise of hypersensitive ctni levels even if reports lack histological detection of myocardial inflammation while the myocardial localization of sars-cov-2 remains to be confirmed with certainty we cannot ignore that other viruses such as seasonal flu and parvovirus b-19 cause myocarditis fung et al 2016 however the detection of sars-cov viral rna in 35 of cardiac biopsies performed in patients during the sars outbreak in toronto 2003 is suggestive to support the hypothesis of coronavirus cardiotropism furthermore pulmonary infection with the human sars-cov led to ace2-dependent myocarditis in mice oudit et al 2009 it is therefore conceivable that sars-cov-2 also infects cardiomyocytes secondly the loss of ace2 is associated to increased susceptibility to heart failure while augmented ace2 levels prevent and reverse the heart failure phenotype emerging as a key protective pathway in the heart pathology patel et al 2016 accordingly cvd is associated with decreased baseline levels of ace2 expression chamsi-pasha et al 2014 during its replication sars-cov is able to progressively downregulate ace2 protein expression dijkman et al 2012 it has therefore been hypothesized that the loss of ace2 function may also occur during sars-cov-2 infection garami 2020 henry et al 2020 in particular the binding of sars-cov-2 to ace2 might reduce the residual ace2 activity thereby altering the aceace2 balance and generating a ras dysregulation with higher ace andor lower ace2 a combination of phenomena that can result in co-occurrence of lung heart and renal acute failure garami 2020 henry et al 2020 the predominance of the aceang iiat1 axis function compared to the ace2ang17mas counterpart could be responsible of the typical vasoconstrictive pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative effects of ang ii occurring in these conditions that could ultimately evolve to acute heart failure and ards zhang and baker 2017 henry et al 2020 accordingly the ace2 production is dramatically impaired during ards resulting in dominant ace activity wsten-van asperen et al 2011 considering that peripheral ang ii levels were found to be significantly higher in covid-19 patients with respect to healthy subjects and that positively correlated with the viral load and lung injury liu et al 2020b the hypothesis of the ras pathway dysregulation in both lung and cardiac injury during sars-cov-2 infection should be investigated garami 2020 henry et al 2020 third the sars-cov-2-dependent ace2 downregulation could trigger monocytemacrophage activation and induce severe lung inflammation contributing to the pathogenesis of acute lung injury up to the onset of respiratory failure sodhi et al 2018 garami 2020 the hypoxemia consequent to severe interstitial pneumonia can stimulate renin secretion and renin gene expression kramer et al 1998 thereby leading to a vicious circle garami 2020 that could enhance cardiac damage in covid-19 patients notably high ang ii levels were associated with hypertension heart failure packer and mcmurray 2017 and diabetes hao et al 2013 which both represent the most common underlying comorbidities in patients more vulnerable to sars-cov-2 infection of course the relationship between virus load onset and magnitude of covid-19 and ace2 downregulation-dependent ras dysregulation in lungs and heart requires a lot more compelling evidence moreover additional studies are mandatory to investigate whether the acute myocardial injury due to sars-cov-2 infection might be related to ace2 expression rather than activity inhibiting the classical ras pathway with ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker arb represents a first-line pharmacological strategy to treat arterial hypertension paz ocaranza et al 2020 which is usually associated with reduced lung function schnabel et al 2011b intriguingly ace2 expression in humans is enhanced by these treatments thomson 2020 whereas the arbs losartan and olmesartan were found to increase by threefold cardiac ace2 expression in a rat model of acute myocardial infarction ami gurwitz 2020 this observation led some investigators to speculate about a mechanistic link between the preexisting use of these drugs and predisposition to sars-cov-2 infection thomson 2020 kuster et al 2020 esler and esler 2020 as described in the ace2 in the heart section however ace2 confers protection against both lung and cardiac injury so that it has also been proposed to use ace inhibitors or arb as therapeutics for treating covid-19 patients prior to ards development gurwitz 2020 although ace inhibitors provide imperfect renoprotection in advanced type 2 diabetes and cv risk remains elevated zoja et al 2011 preliminary evidence from a limited cohort of patients n  187 demonstrated that there was no difference in fatality rate between covid-19 patients pretreated or not with ace inhibitors or arb guo et al 2020a moreover inhibition of classical ras pathway proved to exert a beneficial outcome in patients affected by viral pneumonia by likely reducing the respiratory inflammatory burden and cytokine storm induced by virus infection because of increased ace2 expression henry et al 2018 the effect of these drugs on ace2 levels in the lungs is still unknown and larger clinical studies are required to assess the impact of ace inhibitors and arb on severity of sars-cov-2 infection a recent joint statement of the american heart association american college of cardiology and heart failure society of american recommended not interrupting these medications in covid-19 patients affected by chronic arterial hypertension unless otherwise required by changes in patients conditions madjid et al 2020 indeed these life-saving drugs are difficult to replace since other common anti-hypertensive drugs such as beta-blockers cause bronchoconstriction aggravating lung function in general population schnabel et al 2011a and common calcium-channel blockers may cause cardiac conduction defects impair myocardial contractility and cause peripheral edema while the involvement of ace2 in sars-cov-2-induced acute myocardial injury remains controversial there is no doubt that the cytokine storm associated to virus infection is highly detrimental to the heart acute respiratory infections such as those characterizing interstitial pneumonia by sars-cov and mers-cov have long been known to result in major acute cardiac complications which may lead to a 60 increase in short-term fatality rate corrales-medina et al 2013 cardiac complications associated to viral pneumonia include malignant arrhythmias ami and heart failure which likely result from the increased myocardial workload during infections that accelerate myocardial injury or infarction bonow et al 2020 in addition sars-cov-2 has been shown to trigger an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response that besides acute lung injury and ards may ultimately lead to multiple cv complications zheng et al 2020 including ami unstable angina tachycardia heart failure and stroke gorla et al 2018 interestingly sars-cov-2 promotes an aberrant release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by alveolar epithelial cells vascular endothelial cells activated monocytes and lymphocytes which express ace2 on their cells surface furthermore sars-cov-2 could also induce lymphocyte death through pyroptosis which would explain why covid-19 patients undergo lymphopenia thereby further contributing to exacerbate organ injury the cytokine hypothesis for cardiac damage postulates that the deleterious effects of chronic cytokine release on myocardium and vascular endothelium may facilitate the onset of ami or heart failure for instance pro-inflammatory cytokines ie interleukin-1 il-1 il-6 and tnf exert a negative inotropic effect on cardiac contractility likewise the sustained activation of inflammatory signaling eg through tnf and il-1 may induce massive cardiomyocyte apoptosis and lead to adverse left ventricular remodeling which favors the onset of acute heart failure additionally the cytokine storm stimulates monocytesmacrophages to release matrix metalloproteinases mmps which boost atherosclerotic plaque growth and rupture favor the secretion of pro-coagulant factors and induce hemodynamic changes thereby increasing the probability for ami to occur mann 2015 newby 2016 toldo and abbate 2018 indeed while short-term il-6 release exerts a cardioprotective effect chronic activation of il-6 signaling leads to autoimmune myocarditis fontes et al 2015 in this scenario underlying cvds are predicted to worsen the outcome of patients with viral infections on the heart as already established for pneumonia and seasonal flu several observations support the contribution of deregulated inflammatory signaling in sars-cov-2-induced myocardial injury zheng et al 2020 for instance huang et al observed that plasma levels of inflammatory mediators including il-1 ifn ip10 cxcl10 and mcp1 ccl2 were upregulated in covid-19 patients interestingly this study also showed that cytokine levels were remarkably higher in critically ill patients in particular the serum levels of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf ip10 mcp1 mip1a ccl3 and tnf were higher in icu-patients than those that did not require icu admission thereby suggesting that the cytokine storm is a clinical predictor of mortality huang et al 2020 as ifn is the signature cytokine of the t-helper-1 th1 response rose 2011 these findings suggest that the balance between the pro-inflammatory th1 response and the anti-inflammatory t-helper-2 th2 response is tipped in favor of the former zheng et al 2020 in line with these observations zhu et al reported that hypersensitive ctnt and inflammatory biomarkers eg serum ferritin and il-6 were significantly higher in non-survivors covid-19 patients zhou et al 2020a the high inflammatory burden in severe covid-19 has been further confirmed by another independent study which reported higher levels of serum ferritin il-6 and c-reactive protein in patients who did not survive likely because of fulminant myocarditis ruan et al 2020b of note over-production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was common in sars-cov wong et al 2004 and mers-cov mahallawi et al 2018 patients where acute lung injury was diagnosed further investigations are required to elucidate the potential role of the cytokine storm in the pathogenesis of cv complications including cardiomyopathy acute myocardial injury and myocarditis following sars-cov-2 infection and to understand the potential mechanistic relationships between cvd and covid-19 outcomes as discussed in the next paragraph the nlrp3inflammasome might play a triggering role in the cytokine storm induced by sars-cov-2 nlrp3 is a prr belonging to the nod nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptors nlrs able to recognize both damage-associated molecular patterns damps and pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps schroder and tschopp 2010 such as specific virus molecules stimulating downstream pathways that contribute to the systemic immune response farag et al 2020 nlrp3 inflammasome is a multi-protein platform made up of a sensor protein nlrp3 the adaptor protein asc and a cysteine protease precursor procaspase-1 schroder and tschopp 2010 zhou et al 2011 activated nlrp3 induces the inflammasome assembly interacting with asc that in turn triggers the conversion of the zymogen procaspase-1 into the active caspase-1 franchi and nez 2012 lastly caspase-1 an established inflammatory caspase martinon and tschopp 2007 converts the inactive pro-il-1 and pro-il-18 into active pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 and il-18 epstein and dinarello 1984 finally il-1 stimulates the release of tnf and il-6 whereas il-18 increases circulating levels of ifn- il-13 il-4 il-8 thereby contributing to the immune inflammatory responses both il-1 and il-18 represent key factors of the host defense davis et al 2011 viral infection has been always associated with inflammation farag et al 2020 and viroporins seem to play a triggering role rather than viral pamps viroporins are a new class of virus proteins composed of 1520 amino acids that homo-oligomerize forming hydrophilic pores across the organelle membranes thereby increasing the permeability to monovalent and divalent cations ie na k and ca2 wang et al 2011 nieva et al 2012 these structures appear to play a crucial role in the virus infectionlife cycle genome replication and assembly farag et al 2020 paving the way to consider the possibility to target viroporins with antiviral strategies scott and griffin 2015 an increase in intracellular ca2 concentration as well as a reduction in cytosolic k are regarded among the most suitable triggering signals for nlrp3inflammasome activation muoz-planillo et al 2013 horng 2014 okada et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 of note viroporins mediate nlrp3inflammasome activation and excessive production of il-1 guo et al 2015 farag et al 2020 to date nlrp3inflammasome activation following a viral infection has been reported for influenza a virus iav hepatitis c virus hcv encephalomyocarditis virus emcv and sars-cov liu et al 2004 ichinohe et al 2010 farag et al 2017 the reported increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines levels such as il-18 and il-1 not only in the plasma but also in lungs and lymphoid tissues of patients affected by sars mers and more recently by covid-19 is potentially consistent with nlrp3inflammasome activation chen et al 2019 huang et al 2020 it is well known that all coronaviruses encode for viroproteins e and 3a which are responsible at least for replication virulence and nlrp3inflammasome activation ie sars-cov castao-rodriguez et al 2018 chen et al 2019 farag et al 2020 sars-cov proteins e and 3a ic differ for intracellular distribution and biophysical properties protein e locates in the endoplasmic reticulum er-golgi intermediate compartment its functionality is strictly dependent on the lipid environment composition nieto-torres et al 2015 and induces ca2 efflux during sars-cov-2 infection which activates the inflammasome complex leading to the acute proinflammatory response associated with virus pathogenicity on the other hand the detailed targeting of protein 3a remains still elusive castao-rodriguez et al 2018 chen et al 2019 farag et al 2020 in addition in vitro studies revealed that also the sars-cov open reading frame 3a orf3a accessory protein which is a strong inducer of the nlrp3inflammasome siu et al 2019 may serve as a viroprotein chen et al 2011 therefore it is plausible that sars-cov-2 may use the same mechanism of action to induce the nlrp3-dependent storm of cytokines and the resulting severe systemic inflammation that often causes fatal outcome it is not surprising that inhibition of the nlrp3inflammasome has recently been put forward as a promising strategy to treat or prevent acute cardiac injury such as ir injury liu et al 2018 toldo and abbate 2018 pasqua et al 2018 likewise targeting nlrp3inflammasome may represent an attractive therapeutic strategy in the treatment of virus-associated diseases such as cvd liu et al 2018 pasqua et al 2018 for instance it has been demonstrated that nlrp3inflammasome activation by hypertension induces a sterile inflammation that results in a chronic low-grade inflammation characterized by an increased activity of nf-b zhu et al 2017 bulln et al 2017 sustained nf-b signaling in turn leads to increased tissue andor circulating levels of proinflammatory mediators such as il-1 and il-18 that induces the activation of immune cells and their consequent detrimental effects on both respiratory tract and heart dalekos et al 1997 rabkin 2009 krishnan et al 2014 based upon these evidences it is reasonable to refer to nlrp3inflammasome as a common pathogenic mechanism included in a vicious cycle that triggers and supports both covid-19 and its most common cv comorbidities such as arterial hypertension in this context targeting nlrp3inflammasome might serve as a therapeutic tool in counteracting the severe systemic inflammation following sars-cov-2 infection while at same time also mitigating the underlying cvd and reducing the mortality rate of hospitalized patients in this regard promising data were provided by a drug recently acquired by novartis namely ifm-2427 which is already under clinical trial mullard 2019 in agreement with other pulmonary diseases covid-19 poses a remarkable challenge to health because of hurdled blood oxygenation and oxygen delivery to tissues when the oxygen supply to tissues becomes insufficient to sustain normal function a situation called hypoxia ensues whereas some organstissues can survive short in response to non-severe hypoxia periods for other organstissues hypoxia represents an intolerable hit that may lead to lethal outcomes as myocardium and cerebral tissues are the most endangered heart and brain represent the primary targets of acute respiratory failure there are several criteria that recommend the transfer of patients to icu one of these is arterial blood oxygen saturation  90 and pao2  60 mmhg smith and nielsen 1999 as the covid-19 pathology mainly concerns lung dysfunction most of these patients may face severe hypoxia for several days and most treatments aim at correcting hypoxia by oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation there are several concerns related to the effects of prolonged hypoxia on the cv system first the hypoxia-driven hyperventilation response mediated by the carotid bodies and aimed at restoring normal oxygenation necessarily implies excessive washout of carbon dioxide which shifts the acid-base balance towards alkalosis such response has been found in healthy subjects even at moderate altitude for periods of time ranging from few days samaja et al 1997 to several months porcelli et al 2017 although often partially compensated by metabolic acidosis alkalosis of either origin represents a common finding in critically ill patients mhle et al 2014 kre et al 2017 although not yet documented alkalosis is expected to damage brain and pulmonary tissue as it enhances oxidant-induced apoptosis in several cell lineages auer 2004 ando et al 2007 second chronic hypoxia weakens the myocardial resistance against stress milano et al 2010 acute hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction at last induces histological changes in the right ventricular rv myocardium netzer et al 2017 contributing to increase rv systolic pressure and hypertrophy common features of pulmonary hypertension mclaughlin and mcgoon 2006 in addition to the effects elicited by acute hypoxia chronic hypoxia leads to pulmonary remodeling which include increased pulmonary vessel density increased frequency of small  50 m wall thickness vessels and increased thickness of pulmonary lamina nydegger et al 2018 2019 all changes imputable to excessive stimulation of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells favre et al 2017 chronic hypoxia is well known to contribute significantly to pulmonary hypertension ramchandran et al 2012 and is associated with many pulmonary hypertension-related diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cystic fibrosis diffuse interstitial fibrosis bronchopulmonary dysplasia infiltrative lung tumors congenital hearts defects and ischemic events third at odds with what happens in healthy subjects exposed to altitude hypoxia which is well known to stimulate erythropoiesis piperno et al 2011 goetze et al 2013 systemic hypoxia represses erythropoiesis in ards patients and these often develop severe anemia  8 gdl which correlates with a poor prognosis and may require blood transfusion silver 2005 jenq et al 2018 this clinical scenario is common in icu patients nguyen et al 2003 and it may be attributable to anemia of inflammation whose etiology is scarcely known the physiological response to hypoxia with compensatory increase in hemoglobin requires an increase in iron transport and use in fact it demands stabilization of ferroportin the transmembrane protein that enables iron release from the cells with increased intestinal absorption the degradation of ferroportin is mediated by hepcidin hep that decreases in healthy subjects thereby enabling the compensatory response to hypoxia gassmann and muckenthaler 2015 however hep levels increase in ards patients galesloot et al 2011 despite their hypoxic condition the consequent loss of hep regulation may limit the efficacy of iron-replacement therapies lasocki et al 2010 this mechanism may be relevant in ards and covid-19 patients because iron release into the circulation and deregulated uptake by tissues that use iron may saturate transferrin increase the non-transferrin-bound aliquot of iron with possibly triggering of unspecific oxidative stress injury fourth although the correction of hypoxia with oxygen therapy remains the major life-saving concern in icu patients excess oxygen delivery or hyperoxia may cause considerable harm ottolenghi et al 2020 in facts hyperoxia caused by breathing mixtures with  40 oxygen markedly elevates reactive oxygen species ros release in the circulation and contributes to tissue injury by oxidative stress nagatomo et al 2012 hyperoxia-induced injury may occur even in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery breathing mixtures containing 40 to 80 oxygen ottolenghi et al 2019 hyperoxia-driven oxidative stress is expected to alter the expression of genes that regulate pathways underlying different responses to oxidative stress terraneo and samaja 2017 intuitively the direction of the alterations driven by hyperoxia is opposite to those elicited by hypoxia however there is evidence that this is not the case in many instances for example the regulation of gene transcription by the hypoxia-inducible factors hifs hifs are well known to respond to hypoxia by acting as transcriptional factors for an array of genes that participate in various cell processes as angiogenesis metabolism cell proliferation control of ros-induced damage and many others giordano 2005 including apoptosis and autophagy ziello et al 2007 gui et al 2016 but recent studies show that hif-1 and hif-2 are indeed up-regulated in the response to hyperoxia as well at least in brain benderro et al 2012 terraneo et al 2017 some types of cancer terraneo et al 2010 2014 and hepatocytes wikenheiser et al 2009 marconi et al 2014 but not in heart gyongyosi et al 2018 although the injury led by hyperoxia has not yet been studied as that led by hypoxia it is established that hyperoxia reduces the expression of angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor vegf signaling and capillary density benderro et al 2012 reduces the anti-apoptotic defense by increasing the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins bax and bad and decreasing the activation of anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-2 and bcl-xl brutus et al 2009 increases neuronal apoptosis concomitantly with decreased protective p-akt and erythropoietin signaling terraneo et al 2017 accumulates oxidized lipids and proteins tatarkova et al 2011 down-regulates neurotrophins that provide tropic support to developing neurons felderhoff-mueser et al 2004 and stimulates ferroptosis a newly discovered iron-dependent form of cell death thereby contributing to brain damage li et al 2017 frailty which was labeled as the most problematic expression of population ageing clegg et al 2013 is often confounded with disability or co-morbidity but frailty is assuming separate distinguished features which highlight the presence of a well-defined phenotype that characterizes elders many elders have multi-organ dysfunction with frailty representing a unifying notion in the care of elderly patients that directs attention away from organ-specific diagnoses clegg et al 2013 the concept of frailty is now universally defined as an individuals state of increased vulnerability and susceptibility to adverse health outcomes or death when exposed to a stressor in this case the pulmonary diseases arising from sars-cov-2 infection in the presence of an age-dependent excess of ros and reactive nitrogen species rns frailty may be viewed as the result of the disruption of the organisms homeostatic balance that leads to heterogeneous clinical manifestations when the individual is exposed to endogenous or exogenous stressors only a minor but non negligible number of people  65 years old is considered frail the prevalence of physical frailty ranges from 4 to 17 mean 99 with a higher prevalence in persons  80 years old among patients with multiple comorbidities collard et al 2012 in the absence of pandemics the prevalence of frailty and cvd increase with age making their coexistence common epidemiological studies suggest that frailty may represent an important prognostic marker for patients with several types of cvds including coronary artery disease heart failure as well as older people undergoing surgical and transcatheter interventions afilalo et al 2014 despite unclear biological underpinnings of frailty and unexplored interaction with heart failure it appears that frailty and cvd share common pathophysiological pathways bellumkonda et al 2017 among cvds ami is a major cause of death morbidity and loss of quality of life in industrialized countries accounting for more than 7 million deaths per year worldwide steg et al 2012 aging is classically regarded to as the greatest risk factor for ami indeed endothelial cell senescence due to increased ros production and dysfunction of nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 nrf2-mediated antioxidant response pathway may compromise endothelial nitric oxide no bioavailability exacerbate inflammatory response and pathogenesis of age-related vascular diseases ie ami and stroke in older patients fulop et al 2018 ungvari et al 2019 an excess of ros and rns is central in many pathways leading to cardiac hypertrophy and failure tocchetti et al 2015 accordingly the incidence of ami and the case-fatality mortality rate are markedly higher in elderly patients who are also more prone to develop post-ami heart failure afilalo et al 2014 when compared to younger subjects aged patients are less amenable to receive percutaneous coronary intervention while they are less sensitive to fibrinolytics carro et al 2011 therefore the impaired resilience of the cardiovascular cells to oxidative stressors in the presence of deficiency of relevant anti-oxidant mechanisms ie nrf2-related pathway may lead to sars-cov-2 detrimental consequences to the aged heart and vasculature moreover the correct fine-tuning of the nitroso-redox balance is fundamental for the function of the main components of the excitation-contraction coupling machinery tocchetti et al 2015 despite the predominance of older patients with cvd among the population randomized clinical trials have generally focused into young subjects without co-morbidities thereby generating data that cannot be extended to elderly patients this feature has been related to the higher case fatality rate in older vs younger subjects hospitalized with ami individuals aged  75 years old do not benefit from the same pharmacological interventions established for their younger counterparts after ami fleg et al 2011 the lower sensitivity to cv drugs in the elderly depends on age-associated physiological changes in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics together with intrinsic deficits in the signaling pathways to protection the reasons for the higher incidenceseverity of ami in elderly subjects are multifactorial and not easy to reconcile with a single triggering event endothelial dysfunction has been regarded as an early mechanism among those leading to the mismatch between oxygen supply and demand that finally culminates in ami moccia et al 2018 in addition aged endothelial cells lose their capability to proliferate and to replace neighboring damaged cells thereby aggravating the impact of coronary endothelium dysfunction moccia et al 2018 consequently aged subjects are more susceptible to develop coronary artery disease since the aging endothelial cells of coronary microcirculation are unable to express cytoprotective pro-survival antioxidant macromolecular damage repair and anti-inflammatory genes due to deregulation of relevant transcription factors pathways such as nrf2 signaling oxidative damage is quite remarkable in microvascular endothelial cells affected by nad depletion and sirtuin 1 dysregulation kiss et al 2019 dampening their angiogenic activity and thus leading to microvascular rarefaction which is an established hallmark of aging valcarcel-ares et al 2012 likewise nrf2 signaling is disrupted during aging also in cardiac myocytes silva-palacios et al 2016 and fibroblasts nacarelli et al 2018 thereby contributing to enhance cardiac vulnerability to oxidative stress it thus appears that the impairment of nrf2 transcriptional activity is key to increase cv risk during aging and could therefore worsen cv damage in older covid-19 patients this scenario could be even worsened when oxygen therapy is required as hyperoxia-induced ros release is postulated to exert a stronger cytotoxic effect on aged vasculature due to its lower resilience to oxidative stress in agreement with these hypotheses a recent study demonstrated that genetic depletion of nrf2 worsened age-related impairment of endothelial no bioavailability and of endothelial monolayer integrity in addition genetic silencing of nrf2 resulted in a dramatic increase in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines fulop et al 2018 also known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype sasp these cytokines include il-1 and tnf ungvari et al 2018 which are recently shown to mediate covid-19-induced cytokine storm enhancing the pro-inflammatory phenotype might represent another mechanism whereby aging-dependent nrf2 dysfunction contributes to exacerbate the detrimental consequences of sars-cov-2 on the cv system moreover aging is associated to a significant perturbation of the ca2 signaling toolkit in cardiomyocytes which leads to a dramatic impairment of heart muscle contraction hamilton and terentyev 2019 the higher mortality for ami in these individuals has further been linked to the age-related decline in the endogenous protective mechanism against myocardial ir injury indeed pre- and post-conditioning are powerful interventions aimed to reduce the infarct size by eliciting endogenous cardioprotection in response to one or several brief cycles of sub-lethal myocardial ir that precede or follow respectively a sustained potentially lethal ischemic insult these conditioning protocols recruit a complex cascade of intracellular signaling pathways mainly risk and safe which converge on mitochondria and limit cell death pagliaro et al 2011 although pharmacological conditioning recapitulates the endogenous mechanisms of cardioprotection induced by both pre- and post-conditioning and might be exploited in the therapy of ami these conditioning protocols are barely effective in aged hearts thereby exacerbating ir injury the loss of cardioprotection in elderly people is not irreversible and might be either rescued or preserved by alternative strategies such exercise boengler et al 2009 which also promotes angiogenesis and increases vascular density in aging mouse models of ami bei et al 2015 presently there is no experimental evidence-based difference in the clinical management of young vs elderly presumably frail subjects at least for cvd conversely the sharp decrease in the endogenous mechanisms of cardioprotection and angiogenic repair during aging suggests that older subjects should undergo a distinct treatment as compared to younger individuals older patients are left with few if any effective therapeutic methods to alleviate symptoms restore distal perfusion and preserve tissue viability calling for innovative approaches to restore the efficiency of cardioprotective mechanisms with aging for example by pursuing alternative strategies to foster pre-conditioning post-conditioning and endogenous protection boengler et al 2009 as a matter of facts actual strategies and treatments for covid-19 patients are essentially the same for young and elder patients but if cv patients respond differently depending on their age or frailty why shouldnt this occur in covid-19 patients one could however suggest that restoring endothelial function eg at microvascular level or improving vascular health during aging could represent an effective strategy to treat covid-19 in critical patients for instance activation of nrf2 by drugs eg propofol during mechanical ventilation or oltipraz zhou et al 2020c ruan et al 2020a or by epigenetic compounds eg nicotinamide mononucleotide resveratrol histone deacetylase inhibitors csiszr et al 2015 pooladanda et al 2019 kiss et al 2019 could rescue at least partially stress resilience of both endothelial and cardiac cells in aging individuals affected by covid-19 otherwise regular physical exercise and dietary intake of functional foods lionetti et al 2019 has also been shown to activate nrf2 in the myocardium as well as across a variety of tissues and could be advised to frail older people to reduce the risk to develop major cv complications in the case of sars-cov-2 infection mcphee et al 2016 done and traustadttir 2016 preliminary evidence has been provided in favor of a relationship between the number of days of exceeding the limits for particulate matter pm 10 ie fine material with an airborne diameter  10 m recorded in the control units of some cities and the number of hospitalizations from covid-19 in northern italy setti et al 2020 the area of this country which suffered the highest number of cases and fatalities the pm is worldwide recognized as an important prompt for cvd as the inhalation of pm is certainly a trigger for multiple cv disorders such as ami heart failure and stroke in urban communities liang et al 2020 inhalation of smaller pm such as pm 25 ie fine material with an airborne diameter  25 m leads to pulmonary inflammation and cardiotoxicity via secondary systemic effects mills et al 2009 as it can easily reach the alveolar space by irritating the alveolar wall up to onset of lung dysfunction xing et al 2016 cohen and colleagues have reported that more than four million deaths are attributable to pm 25 with nearly 60 of these due to cvds cohen et al 2017 this link is emphasized in the countries where air pollution concentration is continuing to rise mills et al 2009 the exposure to pm is still associated with the incidence of coronary events in europe even though the limit value was set at 50 gm3 daily cesaroni et al 2014 the scientific literature reports that air pollution and pm has been associated with a plethora of cv events such as angina ami arrhythmia and heart failure dockery et al 1993 samet et al 2000 peters et al 2001 mann et al 2002 brook et al 2003 bhatnagar 2006 mills et al 2009 hence any comorbidity with other pathologies as obesity and hypertension seems to impact the cvd-associated mortality in adults who are daily exposed to higher levels of pm mazidi and speakman 2018 a time-stratified case-crossover study design evaluated in the milan area lombardy region italy during the winter period 20162017 the independent short-term effect of flu outbreaks air pollution and temperature murtas and russo 2019 they observed a statistically significant relationship between pm 10 levels and flu for cvd mortality and between flu and temperature for deaths by natural causes in wuhan region china where air quality index is extremely low and the average daily pm concentration is 11560 gm3 similar association between air pollution mainly no2 and cvd mortality during 4-year period 20062009 has been observed albeit no correlation was found directly among pm 10 and cvd liu et al 2015 a positive relationship between pm 25 and influenza-like illness at the flu season reported for the period january 2008december 2014 was then observed via time-series analysis in beijing feng et al 2016 both lombardy and wuhan areas are hitherto clusters of the worldwide pandemic of covid-19 with higher number of people deceased in contrast with the rest of the nations italy and china where the virus also spread but with less aggressiveness as to march 27 chen at al provided evidence that avian influenza h5n1 may be subjected to intercontinental transportation via saharian dust chen et al 2010 thus one wonders if air pollution has an impact upon covid-19 spread ciencewicki and jaspers 2007 a position paper of the italian society of environmental medicine proposed that pm could represent a factor that favors long-term persistence of viruses in the atmosphere httpwwwsimaonlusitwpsimawp-contentuploads202003covid19position-paperengpdf indeed only for the lombardy region the number of infected persons before quarantine and lockdown and the mean number of pm 10 exceedancesmonitoring stations results in a r2 correlation of 0974 the study concluded that there is a tangible risk that pm may serve as carrier for the viruses in the northern regions of italy whereas further investigation and more solid data are necessary to disentangle this hypothesis to strengthen this hypothesis the exceedance in pm during the period february 1029 2020 and the number of covid-19 cases reported as to march 26 from the italian national institute of health were visually correlated it is clear from this analysis that in the selected provinces in lombardy piedmont and emilia-romagna where the majority of covid19 cases occurred so far the pm 10 exceedances increment was higher while these preliminary data hint at a correlation between air pollution which represents an established risk factor and covid-19 further in-depth retrospective cross-sectional investigations are required keeping in mind the quarantine have drastically reduced the pm concentration in the aforementioned regions httpswwweeaeuropaeuhighlightsair-pollution-goes-down-as as already described in the case of ebola and sars-cov outbreaks kruse 2020 repurposing of clinically approved drugs has been invocated to effectively treat patients who are at greater risk of death for instance the raising hope that lopinavir and ritonavir which are employed as human immunodeficiency virus hiv protease inhibitors could display clinical efficacy against covid-19 was recently dashed by the failure of a clinical trial in china cao et al 2020 as reviewed in li and de clercq li and de clercq 2020 clinical trials were already launched in china and usa to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of multiple food and drug administration fda-approved antiviral treatments including the nucleoside analogues favipiravir and ribavirin and the experimental nucleoside analogue remdesivir nct04280705 holshue et al 2020 the list of antiviral agents that were proposed in the fight against covid-19 include oseltamivir pencicloviracyclovir ganciclovir sarilumab galidesivir nitazoxanide rapamycin recombinant interferons and chlorpromazine li and de clercq 2020 guo et al 2020b of note a randomized controlled clinical trial of sarilumab nct04315298 a monoclonal antibody against the il-6 receptor is currently assessing whether the modification of the inflammatory response induced by this treatment could provide benefit in reducing lung inflammation and improving lung function in covid-19 patients an alternative but not mutually exclusive strategy consists in the identification of a small molecule drug that could be repurposed to inhibit the interaction between virus and target cells gunaratne et al 2018b kruse 2020 as mentioned in section 3 sars-cov-2 entry requires priming of s protein by furin and tmprss2 hoffmann et al 2020 walls et al 2020 coutard et al 2020 a promising report revealed that camostat mesylate an fda-approved drug which blocks tmprss2 activity effectively prevented sars-cov-2 spread in vitro hoffmann et al 2020 in addition once fully surface-exposed s glycoprotein represents a source of accessible epitopes for the production of neutralizing antibodies and thus a target for ongoing vaccine design efforts walls et al 2020 in this line the use of antibody-rich plasma donated by patients who fully recovered from covid-19 is under evaluation to determine if it could shorten the length or lessen the severity of the illness this finding opens the way to the repurposing of clinically available drugs interfering with the endocytic pathway mediating sars-cov-2 entry into the target cell eg through inhibition of ph-mediated endocytosis bulk alkalinization of endolysosomal el vesicles or blockade of el proteases for instance fda-approved cardiotonic steroids ouabain and bufalin known for their selective blockage on the nak-atpase can significantly impair mers-cov infection through the endocytic pathway burkard et al 2015 remarkably the lysosomotropic compound chloroquine a cheap and widely available anti-malarial drug was shown to block sars-cov-2 infection in vitro at a clinically relevant concentration wang et al 2020c and according to preliminary reports proved to exert beneficial exerts in covid-19 patients colson et al 2020 mitj and clotet 2020 gao et al 2020 inciardi et al 2020 chloroquine could indeed accumulate within the acidic vesicles and interfere with the el vesicle trafficking golden et al 2015 of note chloroquine which is also employed in autoimmune disorders has the potential to counteract the cytokine storm associated with covid-19 severity liu et al 2020a obviously the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine in covid-19 patients needs to be supported by randomized clinical trials conducted on large cohorts of patients since the margin between the effective therapeutic dose and toxic dose is narrow and chloroquine poisoning has been associated with serious cv disorders frisk-holmberg et al 1983 nevertheless these preliminary evidences endorse the view that the usage of a single compound potentially able to block viral-host cell interaction and attenuate the inflammatory response could provide an effective weapon against the disease in this view a hint at an alternative therapy against covid-19 is suggested by the cv comorbidities affecting these patients ca2 antagonists have long been used as first line anti-hypertensive drugs due to their ability to block l-type voltage-gated ca2 channels in vascular smooth muscle cells godfraind 2017 oparil et al 2018 ca2 antagonists include dihydropyridines eg nifedipine nicardipine and nimodipine as well as phenylalkylamines eg verapamil and the benzothiazepine diltiazem godfraind 2017 rosenfeldt et al 2018 nifedipine verapamil and diltiazem often used in combination with ace inhibitors or sartans reduce arterial hypertension with quite tolerable side effects godfraind 2017 rosenfeldt et al 2018 furthermore nicardipine is strongly recommended as antihypertensive agent in stroke rosenfeldt et al 2018 whereas verapamil is largely employed to treat both hypertension and ventricular arrhythmia godfraind 2017 it has long been known that ca2 antagonists may block endolysosomal el two-pore channels 12 tpc12 genazzani et al 1997 moccia et al 2003 which play a crucial role in el trafficking patel 2015 at the same concentrations as those reported to block l-type voltage-gated ca2 channels tpcs are gated by multiple agonists including nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate naadp sphingosine and the el phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 35-bisphosphate galione 2019 tpcs-mediated ca2 release recruits el-located ca2-sensitive decoders including calmodulin synaptotagmin vii and arf6 faris et al 2018 to regulate vesicular fusion and trafficking galione 2019 a screening campaign aiming at repurposing fda-approved drugs as novel antiviral compounds recently revealed that classical ca2 antagonists blocked ebola virus and mers-cov infections in vitro sakurai et al 2015 gunaratne et al 2018a b ebola virus entry into host cells occurs by macropinocytosis followed by relocation to the endosomal compartment thereafter the virus binds to the endosomal membrane protein npc1 to fuse with acidic late endosomeslysosomes and release the capside into the cytoplasm falzarano and feldmann 2015 a recent series of investigations demonstrated that inhibiting tpcs-mediated el ca2 release with nifedipine verapamil nicardipine and diltiazem prevented viral genome entry in the cytoplasm sakurai et al 2015 penny et al 2019 subsequently the same strategy was worked out to find clinically available tools to treat mers which was first described in saudi arabia in 2012 zaki et al 2012 and subsequently reported to affect more than 1500 subjects zumla et al 2015 as described above for sars-cov-2 the viral s protein mediates mers-cov entry upon binding to the host cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 followed by proteolytic priming via tmprss2 raj et al 2013 park et al 2016 following clathrin-mediated endocytosis mers-cov is redirected through the el system where the s protein is proteolytically cleaved by lysosomal proteases which results in vesicular fusion and capside release into the cytoplasm millet and whittaker 2014 burkard et al 2014 notably mers-cov pseudovirus translocation was also attenuated by blocking el tpcs with verapamil nicardipine and nimodipine gunaratne et al 2018b tpcs function as homodimers in which each subunit comprises two homologous six-transmembrane domain motifs therefore they represent the molecular ancestors of the  cav subunits of voltage-gated na and ca2 channels with which they share the structural motifs within the pore regions patel 2015 in the same line docking analysis and ca2 fluxes measurements confirmed that ca2 antagonists avidly bind to the tpc pore rahman et al 2014 as a further support to the proposal to probe ca2 antagonists to treat covid-19 it is worth recalling that chloroquine inhibits sars-cov-2 virus entry by promoting the alkalinization of el vesicles wang et al 2020c liu et al 2020a which is a common strategy to perturb el membrane fusion notably elevating el ph would also result in a significant reduction in el ca2 concentration usually around 500 m as el ca2 refilling is mainly driven by the h gradient morgan et al 2011 faris et al 2018 for instance the lysomotropic weak base nh4cl abrogates el ca2 storage morgan et al 2011 as well as mers-cov gunaratne et al 2018b and sars-cov yang et al 2004 vincent et al 2005 entry in the cytoplasm furthermore lysosomotropic agents also affected ace2 localization in vitro the viral receptor remains trapped within perinuclear vacuoles upon pretreatment with chloroquine nh4cl or bafilomycin a1 wang et al 2008 besides supporting viral entry into the host cells preliminary evidence suggested that tpcs contribute to deliver the el ca2 signal responsible for nlrp3 inflammasome activation tseng et al 2017 it thus appears that blocking tpcs-mediated el ca2 release with either chloroquine or ca2 antagonists might represent a potential perspective to treat covid-19 patients by interfering with both sars-cov-2 infection and the subsequent inflammatory response while this hypothesis remains to be probed by a devoted experimental pipeline a clinical trial has been launched in china to evaluate the therapeutic outcome of tetrandrine on sars-cov-2-infected subjects clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04308317 tetrandrine is an alkaloid isolated from the root of stephania tetrandra a vine that grows in china and taiwan and is widely employed in china to treat autoimmune diseases cv disorders hypertension and cancer tetrandrine targets multiple intracellular signaling pathways including l-type voltage-gated ca2 channels which could explain its beneficial effects on the cv system yao and jiang 2002 of note tetrandrine was recently shown to inhibit tpcs-mediated el ca2 release and to attenuate ebola sakurai et al 2015 and mers-cov-2 gunaratne et al 2018b entry into the host cells these findings however may suggest the hypothesis that repurposing of ca2 antagonists could prove effective in treating sars-cov-2 infection while at the same time attenuating cv and respiratory dysfunction co-occurring in older covid-19 patients the covid-19 pandemic has rapidly spread throughout the globe by preferentially affecting older individuals with underlying cv comorbidities besides ards and acute kidney injury cardiovascular complications also represent a common consequence of the disease and at the same time a cause for adverse outcome in covid-19 patients although we cannot ignore emerging events of drug-induced sudden cardiac death among treated covid-19 patients chorin et al 2020 clinical reports well support careful evaluation of the pathogenic mechanisms that promote the onset of severe covid-19 due to cvd following sars-cov-2 infection these include for example classical ras pathway and ace2 nlrp3inflammasome and hypoxemia fig 1 furthermore the prevalence and death toll of covid-19 increases with aging as well as frailty and seems correlated with prolonged exposure to air pollution both of which represent life-threatening cv risk factors in our opinion understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that exacerbate the impact of covid-19 in patients with existing cv pathologies and lead to major cardiac complications is mandatory to design a truly cardioprotective therapy while waiting for the vaccine  is hypertension a real risk factor for poor prognosis in the covid-19 pandemic purpose of review there is increasing evidence indicating an association between several risk factors and worse prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 including older age hypertension heart failure diabetes and pulmonary disease hypertension is of particular interest because it is common in adults and there are concerns related to the use of renin-angiotensin system ras inhibitors in patients with hypertension infected with covid-19 levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 a protein that facilitates entry of coronavirus into cells may increase in patients using ras inhibitors thus chronic use of ras inhibition could potentially lead to a more severe and fatal form of covid-19 in this review we provide a critical review to the following questions 1 does hypertension influence immunity or ace2 expression favoring viral infections 2 are the risks of complications in hypertension mediated by its treatment 3 is aging a major factor associated with worse prognosis in patients with covid-19 and hypertension recent findings despite the potential involvement of immune responses in the pathogenesis of hypertension there is no evidence supporting that hypothesis that hypertension or ras inhibitors contributes to unfavorable outcomes in viral infections future investigations adopting a strict protocol for confirming hypertension status as well as assessing associated comorbidities that may influence outcomes are necessary from the therapeutic perspective recombinant ace2 may serve as a potential therapy but relevant studies in humans are lacking definitive evidence regarding the use of ras inhibitors in patients with covid-19 is needed 5 randomized trials examining this issue are currently underway there is no current scientific support for claiming that hypertension or its treatment with ras inhibitors contribute to unfavorable outcomes in covid-19 drager luciano f  pio-abreu andrea  lopes renato d

here we stratified covid-19 patients based on their comorbidities to assess their risk of serious adverse outcomes we collected 856 hospitalized cases diagnosed with covid- including admission to intensive care unit owing to disease progression shock invasive ventilation and death to determine the relationship between comorbidities and adverse outcomes the median age of patients was 46 36-56 years 439 513 were men 242 283 had comorbidities and 152 178 had two or more comorbidities the most common comorbidity was hypertension 142 166 followed by diabetes 64 75 of the 856 patients there are 154 180 severe cases3237 reached composite endpoints of which 22 91 were from the comorbidity group and 10 16 from the non-comorbidity group p  0001 after adjusting for age and gender status the risk of reaching the composite endpoint was higher in the group with comorbidity than in that without comorbidity hazard ratio hr 304 95 confidence interval ci 140-660 hr values for patients with one two and three or more comorbidities were 161 95 ci 044-591 344 95 ci 131-908 and 690 95 ci 269-1769 respectively conclusions covid-19 patients with comorbidities had worse clinical outcomes as compared to those without any comorbidity the higher the number of comorbidities the greater was the risk of serious adverse outcomes  since the first report of the new coronavirus pneumonia in wuhan hubei in december 2019 1  the cumulative number of confirmed cases has exceeded 2 million worldwide the cumulative death toll exceeded 100000 by april 16 2020 raising a serious global concern according to previous reports coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is clinically manifested as but not limited to fever cough sputum headache fatigue and diarrhea most patients with covid-19 have comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease and chronic liver disease 1-3  the presence of comorbidities was shown to be related to high mortality among hospitalized patients with the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infection 4 5 6 7  in patients with h7n9 comorbidities were considered as important factors for poor prognosis 8 9  similar conclusions have been reported in several clinical reports on patients with influenza 10 11 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 12 infections the new coronavirus-19 is extremely contagious with an estimated basic reproduction number ro between 2 and 3 13 14  which is comparable to that of the sars-cov 15  meanwhile elderly people are more likely to be infected and a considerable part of them carry up with chronic diseases 16  while their own resistance to the disease is low they are prone to develop into serious cases and have adverse outcomes 17 18  a large number of epidemiological studies have analyzed the proportion of comorbidities between the mild and severe groups the proportion of comorbidities in the severe case group is higher than that in the mild 19 20 21  however clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients with and without comorbidities have not been studied further the relationship between comorbidities and serious adverse outcomes of covid-19 remains unclear in the present study we analyzed different manifestations in patients with covid-19 based on the presence type and number of comorbidities and assessed their relationship with the risk of serious adverse outcomes in this large retrospective study we collected the data of 856 patients diagnosed with covid-19 from january 17 to february 7 2020 based on the chinese version of the covid-19 diagnosis and treatment program 6th edition 22  data on their clinical and epidemiological characteristics were collected by the health commission of zhejiang province china all patients were assigned to designated hospitals in the zhejiang province for diagnosis and treatment the results of our analyses have been reported to the peoples government of zhejiang province and will be shared with the world health organization this study was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of the first affiliated hospital college of medicine zhejiang university no iit20200005c epidemiology data laboratory tests clinical features imaging data treatment methods and clinical outcomes of the patients were reported to the zhejiang health committee of china by the designated hospital comorbidities were determined according to the patients readme at the time of admission the data were recorded in an electronic database by an independent researcher and verified by another experienced clinician all patients underwent corresponding imaging examinations chest radiographcomputed tomography and conventional respiratory virus screening including parainfluenza virus avian influenza adenovirus sars and mers on admission the clinical outcomes were followed up to february 7 2020 comorbidity the presence and the number of comorbidities were mainly depend on patients self-report on admission including hypertension heart diseases diabetes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd asthma chronic liver disease chronic kidney disease malignant tumor human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection hematologic disease and other comorbidities that may have influence on the illness including the use of immunosuppressants tuberculosishyperthyroidism hypothyroidismand cerebrovascular diseases we divided covid-19 cases into severe and common groups severe cases included severe and critically ill patients while the common group included common types and patients with no pneumonia upon imaging on admission but confirmed by laboratory tests the classification was based on the chinese version of the diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 6th edition the endpoint outcome comprised a composite endpoint including admission to the icu owing to disease progression or failure of other organs and mechanical ventilation caused by respiratory failure shock and death statistical analyses were performed using the spss software version 250 the normally distributed continuous measurement data are expressed as mean  standard deviation while non-normally distributed measurement data are expressed as median and quartile q1-q3 categorical variables are expressed as number  t-test and chi-square test were used for comparisons between groups while a non-parametric test was used as

regression model was used to determine potential risk factors for reaching the composite endpoint the results are expressed as hazard ratio hr and 95 confidence interval ci age and gender status were adjusted using the cox regression model as of february 7 2020 a total of 856 patients with covid-19 in the zhejiang province were included in this study these patients comprised 417 487 female and 439 513 male their median age was 46 36-56 years a total of 417 487 patients had a history of contact with the epidemic area 366 428 had been in close contact with covid-19 patients and 216 252 were

patients with three or more comorbidities reaching the composite endpoints was significantly different from that reported in other two groups  table  2  we listed the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of some common comorbidities including hypertension diabetes chronic hepatitis b malignant tumors heart disease and chronic kidney disease the incidence of severe disease was higher

with comorbidities had a significantly higher risk of reaching the composite endpoint as the number of comorbidities increased the risk of reaching the composite endpoint also increased  figure 1  after adjusting for age and gender status we divided patients based on the type and number of comorbidities and performed a cox proportional hazard regression analysis  figure 2  the results of the multivariate regression analysis showed that hypertension was the risk factor for the composite endpoint hr 474 95 ci 222-1009 we also divided the patients with hypertension into angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor aceiangiotensin receptor blocker arb and non-aceiarb groups based on their medication and compared the epidemiology data clinical characteristics and prognosis no significant difference was observed between the epidemiology data and clinical characteristics of these two groups online supplement table e1  we used the cox regression analysis to explore the risk of reaching the composite endpoint in these two groups after adjusting for age and gender status but no significant difference was found online supplement table  e2  in comparison with the patients without comorbidities those with two or more comorbidities had a higher risk of reaching the composite endpoint hr 344 95 ci 131-908 for two comorbidities and hr 690 95 ci 269-1769 for three or more comorbidities this is a large multicenter retrospective study conducted on sars-cov-2 infection cases in zhejiang well representing the epidemiological situation of covid-19 in central china comorbidity has always been a risk factor for many diseases including the pandemic sars 12  mers 7  h7n9 9  or even common influenza 11 and community-acquired pneumonia 23  patients with underlying diseases in general show worse outcomes than the otherwise healthy patients and their resistance to most diseases is low this situation promotes the progression of disease condition in patients with covid-19 comorbidities are common approximately 30-50 of the patients were reported to have one or more comorbidities the most common being hypertension 30-50 diabetes 8-20 cardiovascular disease 5-20 chronic liver disease 1-5 and chronic kidney disease 1-4 3 19 24 25  patients with comorbidities have compromised immune status decreased disease resistance and are more likely to suffer from severe infection than those without comorbidities our study describes the relationship between comorbidities and clinical outcomes of covid-19 that plays an important role in the clinical diagnosis treatment and prevention of covid-19 our results show that severe covid-19 is more common among patients with comorbidities than in those without any comorbidity consistent with clinical manifestations imaging findings and number of reaching the composite endpoint differences were all statistically significant corroborating the previous finding that comorbidity is a risk factor for patients with covid-19 further many reports 16 have shown that advanced age is closely related to the severely poor prognosis of covid-19 those with comorbidities were generally older than patients without comorbidities p  0001 this may be one of the factors contributing to the exacerbation of condition in patients with comorbidities among the comorbidities evaluated in the present study hypertension and diabetes were the most common and probably related to the high incidence of the disease in the entire population we evaluated the relationship between different comorbidities and covid-19 outcomes using the cox regression analysis after adjusting for age and gender status the results show that only hypertension hr 474 95 ci 222-1009 but not other comorbidities was associated with covid-19 outcomes p  005 sars-cov-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 more and more scholars pay close attention to the effect in medications that act on the reninangiotensin aldosterone system to covid-19we divided hypertension patients into aceiarb and non-aceiarb groups and analyzed their epidemiology data clinical characteristics and prognosis however no significant difference was observed consistent with the results of a previous report 26  the impact of aceiarb drugs on covid-19 remains controversial 2728  given the relatively few cases except hypertension the error may be related to the small sample size further studies are warranted to determine the relationship between other comorbidities and serious adverse outcomes we observed that the number of comorbidities was related to adverse outcomes of patients the higher the number of comorbidities the greater was the risk of adverse events figure 1  the hr was 344 95 ci 131-908 for patients with two comorbidities and 690 95 ci 269-1769 for those with three or more comorbidities the p-value was less than 005 therefore upon admission to a hospital patients should be carefully interrogated about their existing comorbidities and then classified depending on the number of comorbidities patients with many comorbidities had poor physical conditions and were at a high risk of adverse outcomes therefore more attention should be paid to the changes in the condition of covid-19 patients with underlying diseases in particular elderly patients with comorbidities should be more carefully monitored to prevent occurrence of serious adverse events in summary our report systematically describes the impact of the presence type and number of comorbidities on the clinical outcomes of patients with covid-19 the relationship between comorbidities and adverse outcomes was further clarified which would be helpful for the prevention and treatment of the epidemic this is the first comprehensive investigation on the comorbidities of patients with covid-19 in the zhejiang province and may represent the global scenario our research has a few limitations the most important being collection of information on comorbidities considering the severity of the epidemic and the shortage of medical resources some admitted patients especially patients with mild infection did not receive systemic imaging examination the diagnosis rate of basic disease varied hence we mainly focused on the self-report of patients at the time of admission however some of the comorbidities were under-reported for various reasons such as economic conditions and lack of awareness on health this may lower the significance of our statistics of comorbidities but not much from the actual situation because the proportion of comorbidities in our report is generally consistent with the existing literature in the country 325 additionally our study was a retrospective analysis since the error in data collection may slightly reduce some credibility we need to consider prospective cohort studies to provide more reliable data in future some patients continued to be hospitalized during this data is expressed as mean  standard deviation median with quartile q1-q3 and number  data is expressed as mean  standard deviation median with quartile q1-q3 and number  a comparison of time-dependent risk of reaching the composite endpoints in

the mechanism for headache as well as other cerebrovascular symptoms of preeclampsia is poorly understood the headache is usually of acute onset and described as being the worst headache ever the headache may be temporal frontal occipital or diffuse although not pathognomonic a feature that suggests preeclampsia-related headache rather than another type of headache is that it persists despite administration of over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen in doses of 2 gday concerning signs and symptoms relating to headache in pregnancy and postpartum include worsening headaches in women with chronic headaches headache characteristic eg pain and pattern different from usual headaches and headache with altered mental status seizures papilledema changes in vision stiff neck or focal neurological signs or symptoms

 visual symptoms when present are also symptoms of the severe disease spectrum of preeclampsia they are caused at least in part by retinal arteriolar spasm macular edema or vasogenic edema in occipital lobes gastroesophageal reflux is common in pregnant women especially at night severe persistent right upper quadrant pain or epigastric pain unresponsive to medication and not accounted for by alternate diagnoses may be the presenting symptom of preeclampsia particularly hellp haemolysis elevated liver enzymes low platelet count syndrome it is more significant when associated with abnormal liver enzymes instructions for response to blood pressure measurements are as above for patients with gestational hypertensionpreeclampsia in the setting of chronic hypertension with the patient receiving antihypertensive therapy however consideration could be given to increasing the antihypertensive medication dose 
given the limited information regarding the outcome of pregnancies complicated by covid-19 infection it is important to continue to use clinical judgment in obstetrical management during this pandemic if concerned or believe that the patient needs closer follow-up she should be scheduled accordingly

 with the outbreak of covid-19 and the risk for person-to-person spread of the virus there is a desire to minimize unnecessary visits to health care facilities pregnant patients who are without known complications but have known risk factors for covid 19 recent travel to endemic areas or significant contact with an infected individual and those with mild or asymptomatic covid-19 infection should delay antenatal visits for 14 days women should be classified as low risk or high risk for hdp and adjustments can be accordingly made in the frequency of maternal and fetal surveillance patient should be provided detailed instructions concerning their outpatient management but if there is any evidence of disease progression or if acute severe hypertension develop then prompt hospitalization is suggested  should patients receiving ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers be switched to other antihypertensive drugs to prevent or improve prognosis of novel coronavirus disease 2019

taglialatela   the epidemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 infection has been spreading globally raising increasing concerns in this scenario decisions on preventive symptomatic and potentially life-saving treatments both in the general population and in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 must be based on sound scientific evidence controversial hypotheses about the possible detrimentalprotective effects of antihypertensive drugs acting on the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas in patients with covid-19 have been postulated in several editorials and letters 14 through the regulation of vascular peripheral resistance and potentially of blood volume the raas plays a crucial role in the etiology of hypertension moreover this system promotes atherogenic processes by increasing oxidative stress stimulating vascular muscle and monocyte proliferation based on their biological target drugs inhibiting the raas may be distinguished as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceis angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs and direct renin inhibitors dris aceis enact their blood pressure-lowering effects by blocking the peptidyl-dipeptidase that hydrolyzes angiotensin i a-i to angiotensin ii a-ii in addition it inactivates bradykinin a vasodilating peptide promoting the release of nitrogen monoxide and prostacyclin arbs have no effect on bradykinin metabolism and block the effects of a-ii more selectively than aceis in detail arbs determine their antihypertensive effect by preventing the binding of a-ii to the a-ii receptor type 1 at1 finally dris exert blood pressure-lowering effects by decreasing plasma renin activity and inhibiting the conversion of angiotensinogen to a-i 5 in vitro studies demonstrated that aceis and arbs can significantly increase the expression and activity of angiotensin-conversion enzyme 2 ace2 highly expressed in the heart and lungs 6 coincidentally ace2 is the receptor-binding site for the spike protein of sars-cov-2 at the target cell 7 hence fang et al 4 recently hypothesized in the lancet respiratory medicine that patients with cardiac diseases hypertension or diabetes mellitus treated with ace2-increasing drugs might be at higher risk for severe sars-cov-2 infection accordingly the authors suggested that calcium channel blockers ccbs may be a more suitable alternative antihypertensive treatment than arbsaceis because of their lack of increased ace2 expression or activity on the other hand recently published commentaries outlined the mechanisms by which raas inhibitors may be beneficial in patients with covid-19 and discussed the unclear effects of these drugs on ace2 levels and activity in humans recommending against the suspension or withdrawal of raas blockers 8 9 we present here our contribution to the scientific debate highlighting the importance of continuing aceiarb treatments and reporting several arguments against switching from aceis or arbs to other antihypertensive drugs and specifically to ccbs first to date there is no sound evidence from clinical studies that replacing aceisarbs with other antihypertensive drugs including ccbs is associated with beneficial effects on either the prevention of covid-19 or the prognosis for infected patients the scant available data are mostly derived from in vitro studies for this reason in nature cardiology zheng et al 2 reported whether patients with covid-19 and hypertension who are taking an ace inhibitorarb should switch to another antihypertensive drug remains controversial and further evidence is required 2 second other studies carried out in sars-cov and probably generalizable to sars-cov-2 suggested paradoxically a protective effect of arbs against covid-19 1 the interaction of the coronavirus spike protein with ace2 its cellular-binding site leads to ace2 downregulation in turn this results in excessive production of angiotensin by ace whereas less ace2 is capable of converting it to angiotensin 1-7 an heptapeptide with vasodilator activity 1 10 it has been suggested that exaggerated stimulation of at1 by a-ii determines increased pulmonary vascular permeability thereby mediating increased lung pathology when the expression of ace2 is decreased 11 12 thus higher ace2 expression following chronic treatment with arbs may protect patients infected with sars-cov-2 against acute lung injury rather than increasing the risk of developing covid-19 third switching among different antihypertensive drugs in older patients with relevant comorbidities may put this very frail population at risk of developing adverse cardiovascular events such as uncontrolled hypertensionsymptomatic hypotension or even deterioration of other chronic diseases moreover considering the proven effects of aceis and arbs in reducing mortality in cardiovascular diseases the discontinuation of these therapies could increase the occurrence of negative outcomes in patients affected by cardiovascular diseases and covid-19 13 fourth aceis and arbs are currently approved with differences across various compounds for the treatment of hypertension heart failure and diabetic nephropathy and for secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction whereas ccbs and other antihypertensive drugs are not approved for all the same indications finally none of the drug regulatory agencies worldwide recommend switching from aceisarbs to other antihypertensive drugs or vice versa during the covid-19 outbreak instead on 17 march 2020 the italian drug agency issued a warning against any change of antihypertensive therapies in patients with well-controlled hypertension irrespective of the agents being used because of the lack of clinical data 14 ten days later the european medicines agency advised that since there is no clinical evidence that these drugs can worsen sars-cov-2 infections it is important that patients do not discontinue their treatment with aceis or arbs and there is no need to switch to other medicines 15 these recommendations are in line with the position statements of nationalinternational scientific societies eg european society of cardiology 16 italian society of pharmacology 17 heart failure society of america american college of cardiology and american heart association 18 international society of hypertension 19 european society of hypertension 20 that recommend continuing raas inhibitor therapy for patients who are currently prescribed such agents for indications for which it is known that these agents are safe and effective such as acute and chronic heart failure 21 acute myocardial infarction 22 and hypertension 23 regarding the postulated protective effect aceisarbs should never be used in healthy people or patients who are not affected by diseases that are not approved indications as reported in the summary of product characteristics no specific information has been described for dris nevertheless all the recommendations reported above can be extended to this class of raas inhibitors in a scenario in which experimental clinical studies cannot rapidly shed light on the association between covid-19 and aceiarb use real-world studies based on dedicated covid-19 patient registries whenever available or claims databases from countries with a high incidence of sars-cov-2 infection are urgently needed in the absence of clinical evidence supporting any change in patients treated with aceisarbs clinicians should still follow the old principle primum non nocere  covid19 and diabetes is there

 since then the covid19 pandemic disease caused by this virus had spread around the world until april 10 over 16 million confirmed cases in total and almost 100 000 deaths were identified worldwide everything started from wuhan hubei province in china more than 4 months ago and therefore practically all relevant clinical data are coming from china these findings are showing that arterial hypertension diabetes cardiovascular diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are common comorbidities in patients with covid19

 table 3 however findings are inconsistent and data are more epidemiological than analytical majority of studies did not analyze effect of many confounding factors such as age sex and obesity which could significantly change interaction between comorbidities and outcome it is clear that sudden outbreak of covid19 raised a great attention and forced rapid publication in order to explain epidemiology therapeutic approach and outcome many parameters were not available and inclusion of some risk factors such as obesity that would probably interfere with final results was not possible so far therefore one should be careful in interpretation of available data and indicating hypertension and diabetes as one of the most responsible risk factors at least not in global population the aim of this review was to summarize currently available data regarding the prevalence of diabetes in patients with covid19 and its role in outcome in these patients hence a comprehensive systematic search was performed on pubmed scopus web of science and google scholar to find articles published until april 10 2020 it is still unknown whether patients with diabetes have a higher susceptibility to covid19 but there is an observation that the risk is higher for both infection and disease severity however the percentage of patients with diabetes varies from 3 to 21

 however it should be noted that large level of heterogeneity exists between published studies that differ in sample size age of patients severity of covid19 hospital facilities investigated comorbidities therapeutic approach and finally outcome in one of the largest study published n  1099 so far diabetes was present in 74 of covid19 patients and it was significantly more prevalent in patients with severe form of disease and those who experienced primary outcome end point admission to an intensive care unit the use of mechanical ventilation or death
2
 the same group of authors in a larger group of covid19 patients n  1590 reported diabetes in 82 and it was significantly more prevalent among covid19 patients with severe form than in patients with nonsevere form of disease 346 vs 143
11
 the most recent study which included 1012 noncritically ill covid19 patients reported diabetes in only 3 of patients
17
 even though the prevalence of diabetes was low covid19 patients with aggravation of illness during followup were more frequently diabetic in comparison with those who did not have complication during covid19 lian et al
3
 included 788 patients with covid19 and divided patients into two groups younger than 60 years and older than 60 years thereby contributing to explain why diabetes is related to susceptibility and severity of covid19 the authors showed that many comorbidities hypertension cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease including diabetes were more prevalent in patients older than 60 years than in patients younger than 60 years
3
 difference in age is probably one of the main reasons for risk that is ascribed to diabetes in patients with covid19 studies that investigated cardiac injury in covid19 patients defined by increased cardiospecific enzymes showed that diabetes was significantly more frequent among patients with cardiac injury than in patients without it
4
 
5
 nevertheless prevalence of hypertension cardiovascular diseases and chronic renal disease was significantly higher in patients who experienced cardiac injury and it would be difficult to separate the effect of diabetes from other underlying diseases moreover there was a large difference in age between covid19 patients with detected cardiac injury and those who did not have cardiac injury which also could contribute to worse outcome and cardiac injury
4
 
5
 the authors concluded that cardiac injury is common in covid19 patients 2028 and it is associated with significantly higher mortality in this population

 guo et al
16
 investigated the effect of diabetes on the progression and prognosis of patients with covid19 in limited sample it was found that serum levels of inflammationrelated biomarkers such as il6 creactive protein serum ferritin and coagulation index and ddimer were significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared with those without
16
 which indicates that diabetic patients are predisposed to an hyperinflammatory state that ultimately leads to prompt deterioration of covid19 there was no significant difference in age between diabetics and nondiabetics but diabetics had more frequently cardiovascular disease than their nondiabetic counterparts
16
 however even when diabetic patients without other comorbidities were analyzed the results remained the sameinflammatory and procoagulant factors were significantly higher in diabetic patients among patients with diabetes 292 were on insulin therapy and increased the dose of insulin after admission whereas 375 were on oral antidiabetic therapy before admission and started insulin therapy after admission
16
 this means that patients had poor glycemic control during hospitalization diabetes is hyperinflammatory condition and seems that it may increase susceptibility for covid19 independently of other underlying diseases there are several possible mechanisms a inflammation b hypercoagulable state and c activation of reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas and dysregulation of sympathetic nervous system there is evidence that sarscov the novel coronavirus responsible for covid19 uses ace2 on the surfaces of epithelial cells to bind and enter to infected cells
24
 ace2 is located in cardiac kidney lung and intestinal tissues and converts angiotensin ii to angiotensin 17 which promotes vasodilation the function of raas in diabetic patients is already significantly modified
25
 and acute change in activity of ace2 may be the final trigger for hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable storm in covid19 however these are only hypotheses without reliable clinical evidence some observations from the covid19 pandemic indicated that raas inhibitors were more frequently taken by covid19 patients with unfavorable outcome
5
 these raised large concerns about use of raas inhibitors which are often prescribed to diabetic patients with or without concomitant hypertension another frequent comorbidity in covid19 patients recent findings from covid19 patients showed that raas inhibitors improve outcome in these patients
26
 and confirmed recent position statements from several societies who strongly recommended continuation of regular treatment with raas inhibitors data regarding influence of diabetes on outcome in diabetic patients are still limited table 3 guo et al
5
 in the large study of covid19 patients showed that diabetes was not a prevalent comorbidity in total population 74 but it was significantly more prevalent in patients who experienced the primary composite end point intensive care admission mechanical ventilation and death than in patients who did not have these complications 269 vs 61 nevertheless only 67 out of 1099 patients experienced primary end point and it should be cautious in interpretation of these results other studies that investigated outcome were significantly smaller and results about impact of diabetes are different in most of the studies exists the trend toward higher prevalence of diabetes among nonsurvivors but in majority of studies it did not reach statistical significance due to the small sample size

 table 3 zhou et al
8
 reported significantly higher prevalence of diabetes among nonsurvivors and they proved that diabetes was associated with mortality from covid19 but after adjustment for age and smoking status this predictive value vanished the same was reported for other comorbidities such as hypertension coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
8
 which raised the question about actual importance of diabetes and emphasized the unfavorable significance of patients age the same study showed that proinflammatory biomarkers were not independent predictors of mortality whereas ddimer 1 gml was the only independent predictor from coagulable parameters these findings are challenging the hypothesis that hyperinflammation state in diabetic patients may be responsible for mortality of these patients in covid19 nevertheless the number of patients in this study is very limited n  51 and drawing conclusion is not an easy task wu et al
18
 compared covid19 patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and found that diabetes was a significant predictor of ards hr 234 95 ci 135405 but not of mortality hr 158 95 ci 080313 it should be underlined that multivariate analysis with adjustment for age sex and other possible confounding factors was not performed due to small sample size n  84 in metaanalysis that included 1558 patients with covid19 it was found that diabetes as well as hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was associated with exacerbation and admission to intensive care unit
23

 in the only study that aimed to investigate the effect of diabetes on progression and prognosis of patients with covid19 was reported significantly higher mortality among diabetic patients without other comorbidities 167 vs 0
16
 however diabetic patients were almost twice as old as nondiabetics 61 vs 32 years which must be taken into consideration the majority of inflammatory parameters creactive protein serum ferritin erythrocyte sedimentation rate and interleukin6 and procoagulant factors ddimer and fibrinogen were also significantly higher among diabetic patients without other comorbidities
16
 diabetic complications were more prevalent in patients who died with borderline statistical significance interestingly ketoacidosis and infectious shock conditions that would be assumed to be the most responsible for these findings were not more prevalent among covid19 patients with lethal outcome
16
 initiation of insulin after admission which speaks in favor of poor glycemic regulation was also not related to higher mortality however only 37 diabetic patients were included in this study and only 24 of them did not have other comorbidities which is why this study may provide only directions for some future studies but not conclusions coronary artery disease particularly asymptomatic form which is frequently present in diabetic patients could not be excluded as potential confounding factor which is additional limitation there are still many uncertainties whether diabetes interferes with sarscov2 and facilities the entrance of coronavirus in epithelial cells as well as development of severe complications resulting in lethal outcome it is reasonable to hypothesize that preexisting diabetesinduced target organ damage can be responsible for higher susceptibility of diabetic patients to this virus furthermore diabetic patients with increased inflammatory factors and hypercoagulability are more likely to progress into a worse prognosis therefore patients with diabetes deserve more intensive attention and should be closely monitored due to the risk of rapid deterioration in order to prevent infection and possible complications diabetic patients together with hypertensive patients and particularly those with both comorbidities should have advantage once the vaccine is available there are a number of limitations in available data the selfreporting of comorbidities on hospital admission which was used in most of investigation can cause significant underreporting of comorbidities due to the lack of awareness andor the lack of diagnostic testing which could further interfere with the relationship between comorbidities and clinical outcome furthermore followup was short and some patients remained in the hospital when data were analyzed meaning that actual outcome is unknown which directly influenced published results obesity was not reported in any of these studies and influence of bmi could not be investigated or included in adjustment which would be of a great importance in diabetic patient data about antidiabetic therapy at baseline and during treatment are poor and the prevalence of patients with uncontrolled diabetes is unknown both parameters are potential confounding factors in evaluation of diabetes as independent predictor of susceptibility to virus or outcome of disease the majority of studies involved only limited number of patients which can be an important limitation for reaching statistical power the last but not the least important is the fact that all data are coming from china and one should be careful when extrapolating these findings to other countries with current outbreak of covid19 because the prevalence of comorbidities varies significantly among countries the influence of diabetes on severity and outcome in covid19 patients is not clear because of large gap in evidence it is not known which antidiabetic therapy was used in diabetic patients how many patients were untreated and how many had uncontrolled diabetes obesity as one of the most important comorbidities in diabetic patients has not been investigated at all large studies with comprehensive analysis of all risk factors and longer followup are necessary to answer all questions that have been raised and we should not be surprised if upcoming results from western countries that are currently affected by covid19 will be different from currently available data nevertheless patients with diabetes and hypertension particularly in advanced age should have priority once the vaccine becomes available no conflict of interest  to appear in nutrition metabolism and cardiovascular diseases gang li rui hu xuefang gu  to analyze the potential mechanism of cardiovascular dysfunctions induced by coronavirus disease 2019 and to evaluate more effective therapeutic pathways for patients with cardiovascular diseases data synthesis covid-19 mainly invades the lungs causing its serious damage studies found that covid-19 induced the renin-angiotensin system imbalance inflammatory storm hypoxemia and stress response et al all contributed to hypertension and serious myocardial damage in the process of virus pathogenesis even increasing mortality in covid-19 patients in the process of management of covid-19 infections close attention should be paid on both lung and cardiovascular damage especially on those with only symptoms of cardiovascular diseases early identification timely and effective treatments maintenance of hemodynamics and electrophysiological stability are of great significance on effective treatment and long-term prognosis  the pandemic of covid-19 has been taking lives worldwide it caused by a novel coronavirus which human being are lack of defensive function in whole population it targets humans lung and causes serious damage of lungs based on early reports for people with underlying heart issues the concerns are serious it appears people over 65 with coronary heart diseases or hypertension is more likely to be infected and to develop more severe symptoms in addition some of hospitalized covid-19 patients had cardiovascular diseases in china as characteristic analysis of covid-19 patients hypertension and severe myocardial damage contribute to severity 1 and mortality of covid-19 patients 2  therefore to better understand the development of covid-19 and the impacts of cardiovascular diseases will add valuable measures to the management of covid-19 patients the coronavirus is a kind of positive-chain single-stranded rna virus with a diameter of 80120 nm which can be classified as     type coronavirus has the characteristics of various strains wide distribution and cross species the covid-19 belongs to the  genus and has a capsule on which mushroom-like protein spike make the virus crown-like round or oval size and are often pleomorphic and with a diameter of 60-140 nm detection of viral genes showed that the nucleotide sequences of covid-19 genome share 869 identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome virus sars-cov genome 3  current studies have shown that the covid-19 transmission route is bat-human and intermediate host is to be studied it was transmitted by mainly respiratory droplets as well as transmitted through contact during human-human transmission 4  2 potential mechanism of cardiovascular diseases induced by covid-19 it has been confirmed that a portion of the region at the amino terminal of sars-cov spike protein could bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2ace2 to mediate the fusion of virus and host cell 4  covid-19 are likely to have similar infection pathways to sars-cov in other words ace2 may also be the binding receptor of covid-19 ace2 are homologous enzymes of angiotensin-converting enzyme ace both of which are important components of the renin-angiotensin system ras renin hydrolyzes angiotensinogen to angiotensin i ang i that then is converted to angiotensin ii ang ii by ace the ang ii leads to vasoconstriction elevated blood pressure and vascular remodeling by binding to angiotensin type ii 1 receptor at1r ace2 can act on ang i and generate ang 1-9 then they can generate ang 1-7 through dependent or independent ace2 pathways or ace2 can directly hydrolyze ang ii to ang 1-7 in which ang 1-7 can bind to g protein-coupled mas receptors to mediate vasodilation antioxidant stress inhibit cell proliferation protect vascular endothelium damage as well as other physiological functions like delaying or reversing vascular remodeling and protecting the cardiovascular system aceang iiat1r axis and ace2ang 1-7mas axis antagonize and balance each other to maintain the dynamic balance of human vascular system ace2 is expressed in human alveolar epithelial cells and i which is not only the gateway of virus invasion but also mediates lung injury and lung failure caused by virus infection clinical observations showed that plasma ang ii levels increased significantly in covid-19 patients 5  which further suggests that covid-19 binding to ace2 leads to excessive release of ang ii through ras which in turn burdens heart and vascular system by increasing heart loading eventually cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and high blood pressure virus replicates in cells after its fusion with host cells the invasion of lung surface cells directly causes lung inflammation and the invasion of cardiomyocytes will lead to edema degeneration and necrosis of cardiomyocytes meanwhile pro-inflammatory cytokines are released following cell lysis such as interleukin  the lung injury caused by covid-19 leads to hyoxemia the partial pressure of circulating oxygen and oxygen saturation decrease continuously which lead to the accumulation of oxygen free radicals lactic acid and other metabolites againby circulating around whole body myocardial cell injury becomes inevitable in order to ensure the supply of systemic cell metabolic energy demand the heart pump blood is intensified and prone to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure in addition hypoxemia is also one of the inducing factors of inflammatory response which can promote the formation of inflammatory storm to a certain extent 8  the first and most strong reaction of virus invasion is the activation the human immune and inflammatory responses the interactions among tissues organs and pathogens are a complex stress process especially severe infection at the same time the emotional response of human like anxiety fear et al also increases the stress of patients in the process catecholamine is released in large quantities and plasma catecholamine content is related to blood pressure level blood perfusion coronary heart disease and sudden cardiac death high catecholamine has direct myocardial toxicity which can lead to microcirculation disturbance vasospasm and arrhythmia 9  7  the first most important clinical observations pointed to that a few patients infected with covid-19 might have no sign of respiratory symptoms patients complained with palpitation chest tightness shortness of breath after exercises et al as soon as such patients were confirmed or suspected as covid-19 a sudden acute myocardial infarction or heart failure will occur immediately it is so important to early identify those patients with acquired quarantine measures when covid-19 patients show increased respiratory rate lower blood pressure and even shock electrocardiogram ecg with prolonged qrs interval  the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients showed that hypertension was closely related with the severity of covid-19 infection 20-30 in in-patients 583 in the intensive care unit icu patients and 609 in the death cases it has been known that covid-19 infects human by combining the spike protein on its surface with the ace2 on the alveolar cell membrane which in turn activates the immune system and releases cytokines and inflammatory factors ace2 is an important protective protein in human body covid-19 infection causes down-regulation of ace2 level in the body but has no obvious effect on ace 9 10  the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor aceiangiotensin receptor antagonist arb is associated with ras regulation animal studies have shown that aceiarb drugs can significantly increase the expression level and ace2 biological activity in rat cardiomyocytes 11 12  it is unclear whether aceiarb application will up-regulate the expression and activity of ace2 in lung tissue therefore there is no evidence that aceiarb increases susceptibility to covid-19 or lung damage following infection high blood pressure patients who are currently receiving aceiarb treatment or other antihypertensive drugs are advised not to change the treatment plan without 9 clear contraindications or serious adverse reactions so as not to affect blood pressure homeostasis and increase the risk of hypertension emergencies patients with both hypertension and covid-19 their treatments with aceiarb depend on their conditions for patients with mild illness who have been given long-term medication of aceiarb they may have to continue it while for those who have severe or critical illness the treatment plan should be decided after careful monitoring of vital signs hemodynamics and damage to target organs to avoid dry cough caused by acei covid-19 infection patients are recommended that the use of the acei should be delayed the american heart society acc published a clinical bulletin cardiac implications of novel wuhan coronavirus  and stated that covid-19 has potential effects on the heart especially in patients with cardiovascular disease among covid-19 patients there were about 50 diagnosed with chronic diseases 40 with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and patients with chronic or potential diseases such as obesity hypertension diabetes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease have a higher risk of complications or death after infection virus infection can destroy the stability of atherosclerotic plaque and promote the occurrence of coronary atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease some experts suggest that during the outbreak people with previous cardiovascular diseases should strictly accept tailored and optimized drug treatments to provide additional protection including statins  receptor blockers acei drugs and aspirin in accordance with doctors advice and guidance 12  people with basic cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with the virus and with poor prognosis and the virus infection can also lead to the deterioration of basic heart disease covid-19 patients who have been complicated with cardiovascular basic diseases are recommended to give priority to treatment meanwhile pay attention to vigilance against the recurrence or aggravation of the original basic diseases 8 9 10  above all although the pathogenic mechanism of covid-19 has not been fully elucidated ace2 is currently found to be a key molecular target for covid-19 occurrence and progression and the heart and lung tissues are both important target organs for covid-19 the hypoxemia respiratory distress inflammatory storms caused by covid-19 have adverse effects on the heart and we should pay more attention to the cardiovascular damage induced by covid-19 early identification timely and effective treatment maintenance of hemodynamics and electrophysiological stability are of great significance to alleviate the disease save lives and ensure long-term prognosis  the influence of comorbidity on the severity of covid- 19 disease systematic review and analysis shortened title comorbidity effect on the severity of covid-19 nazar zaki elfadil mohamed a sahar ibrahim gulfaraz khan  a novel form of coronavirus disease sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly across the world this disease originating in wuhan china has become a global pandemic what risk factors influence the severity of the disease is of considerable importance this research is intended to offer a systematic reviewmeta-analysis for assessing how common clinical conditions and comorbidities correlate with covid-19 the meta-analysis incorporated seven studies covering 4101 covid-19 patients from chinese hospitals who had their diagnosis confirmed through laboratory testing the findings demonstrate that the most common comorbidities with the disease were copd 253 or 324 95 ci 199-445 p 00006

associated with disease severity  the 20192020 emergence of the novel covid-19 disease and its swift global expansion represents a health emergency for all of humanity this novel virus which causes severe acute respiratory disease is believed to be a member of the same family of coronaviruses as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 1  unprecedented efforts are currently being made to identify the risk factors that increase the severity of the disease the world health organisation who has suggested that patients with certain medical conditions and elderly people are at greatest risk of developing more severe disease 2  as of june 13 2020 over 76 million people have been infected and 425800 have died from the disease the majority of deaths are thought to have associations with the existence of one or more comorbidity in general it is believed that patients with compromised immune system are especially at high risk 3  a number of researchers have examined the clinicalepidemiological characteristics of patients suffering covid-19 but there has been insufficient investigation regarding mortality risk factors 4  the identification of the principal risk factors and employing appropriate clinical interventions to mitigate them could save numerous lives numerous studies indicate that kidney disease copd coronary heart disease liver disease cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus and hypertension are amongst the most important risk factors for covid-109 this paper will undertake a systemic review of the literature to illuminate the way in which the impact of the covid-19 virus can be made more severe by the existence of such comorbidities and extant conditions this research looked for all relevant published articles between the dates of december 1 2019 and may 20 2020 ie those that were related to comorbidity and its influence on the severity of covid-19 papers were excluded if they were related to the adult patients if they were not written in english if they had not been peer reviewed or if they were not original eg reviews editorials letters commentaries or duplications papers mainly focused on severe vs nonsevere groups of patients were considered severe group are those who develop severe illnesses these cases are more likely to result in icu admission or death a search was undertaken on the covid-19 open research dataset cord- 19  which is regularly updated 5  this dataset contains more than 128000 scholarly articles 59000 of these articles have full text that relates to coronavirus sars-cov-2 and covid-19 a search engine running over the bm25 search index was created so that all articles in this dataset could be screened 6 the bm25 retrieval function creates a document ranking for a dataset on the basis of whether or not searched terms appear in the documents no matter how proximate they may be to each other indexing of the papers occurs through simple application of preprocessing functions that clean and tokenize abstracts having indexed all documents document vectors were created through loading optimized cached json tokens and subsequent application of a document similarity index founded on annoy 7  annoy is a c library that has python bindings for searching for documents within a space that make a close match to a specific query this is an efficient and simple process as it creates substantial read-only file-based data structures used with memory mapping allowing several processes to work with identical data more detail

comprehensive vision reviewmeta-analysis regarding the influence of comorbidities eg diabetes and hypertension on the severity of covid-19 the meta-analysis employed data gathered from 12 studies covering the 4101 patients in chinese hospitals with a covid-19 diagnosis confirmed by laboratory patients from the severe group were all higher age median age 588 than the patients in the non-severe group median age 485 there were more males than females in the study 2196 males 1702 females two of the studies 21 and 24 indicated a significant correlation between gender and disease severity every study examined agreed that being female has no significant correlation with disease severity or 074 95 ci 061-089 rather as with sars-cov and mers-cov patients 26  there is simply a greater likelihood of infection for males as they generally have higher exposure levels meta-analysis of comorbidity found that diabetes mellitus 1134 and hypertension 2207 are two of the most prevalent conditions in this patient cohort this almost exactly parallels the levels of hypertension and diabetes amongst the population of china as a whole hypertension 232 27  diabetes mellitus 109 28 29 found that human pathogenic coronaviruses eg sars-cov and sars-cov-2 achieve binding with target cells using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which originates from epithelial cells in the blood vessels kidneys intestines and lungs 30  ace2 levels are considerably higher for patients suffering type i or type ii diabetes because of this they are given treatment with ace inhibitors andor angiotensin ii type-1 receptor blockers arbs these medications are also used in the treatment of hypertension and this causes an upregulation of ace2 31  ace2 may also be increased using either ibuprofen or thiazolidinediones higher levels of ace2 would therefore promote covid-19 infection thus we agree with the hypothesis that treating hypertension or diabetes with ace2-stimulators could predispose patients to more severe covid-19 we thus concur with fang et al 29 that patients with diabetes hypertension or cardiac disease being medicated with ace2-increasing medication must be regarded as having a greater risk of developing severe covid-19 and so they should be closely monitored for the effects of self-medication zhao q et al in a recent review 32 found that extant copd makes it four times more likely that severe covid-19 will develop these authors also examine the influence of smoking in covid-19 severity coming to the conclusion that there is no significant correlation this accords with the findings of this meta-analysis there has always been an assumption that smoking may have an association with less favorable disease outcomes as there is copious research regarding the detrimental effects of smoking on lung health and the causal correlation between it and many different forms of respiratory disease 33  furthermore smoking is injurious to the immune system and the bodys ability to respond to infection which means that smokers are more susceptible to contracting infections 34  this accords with this papers meta-analysis although as lippi g and henry bm 35 indicate more research will be necessary as further evidence becomes available from the limited data available at present and while acknowledging that the findings above have not been adjusted for other elements that may influence the disease pathway it seems probable that smoking has a correlation with more severe undesirable outcomes in covid-19 cases  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is

accords with recent research from 37  which stated that while it is common for covid-19 patients to exhibit abnormal liver function index this is not a significant factor in covid-19 patients and it may not be associated with serious negative clinical outcomes the study by guan w et al 19 was the only one of the 12 articles under review that found a significant correlation between kidney disease and covid-19 severity examining the articles in total no significant correlation is found p  00476 the clinical symptoms that are most frequently exhibited are fever 7452 cough 6215 myalgiafatigue 387 dyspnoea 339 respiratory failureards 206 diarrhea 1121 and chest tightnesspain 1682 this accords with the majority of published research in terms of heterogeneity in the majority of cases zero or low heterogeneity was displayed by the i 2  so there is relative homogeneity in the majority of cases examined for this research this meta-analysis has certain limitations that could be mitigated in future research firstly only patients in chinese hospitals were included in the studies under review and generalisability can only be assumed if research including other populations is incorporated secondly the presence of multiple comorbidities in single patients has not been considered this is an element virtually every other review as overlooked also finally this meta-analysis does not encompass laboratory radiographic clinical or demographic data  organprotective effect of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 and its effect on the prognosis of covid19 hao cheng yan wang guiqiang wang   the reninangiotensin system ras is a critical homeostasis regulation system of the human body showed in figure 1
1
 the aceang iiat1r pathway is called the classical ras axis which plays a decisive role in regulation while the ace2ang 17masrbased pathway is called the counterregulatory ras axis which plays a negative role in regulation
2
 the primary role of the positive ras axis is to increase sympathetic nervous system tension cause vasoconstriction increase blood pressure and promote inflammation fibrosis and myocardial hypertrophy the negative regulatory axis mediated by angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 can antagonize these effects in the ras system the same component can produce opposite physiological effects through different pathways different components can also be linked by different pathways to have the same physiological effect this flexibility helps the body respond quickly and coordinately to specific stimuli from the whole body to a local area and plays an essential role in maintaining homeostasis this paper will specifically examine the organ protection of ace2 in the body and discuss its potential role for coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 ace2 is a homolog of ace and was discovered in 2000
3
 despite the similarities between ace and ace2 the functions of these two enzymes are entirely different ace2 is active in most tissues and is widely distributed in the heart kidney lung and testis
3
 
6
 ace2 is widely present in human alveolar epithelial cells and small intestinal epithelial cells as well as in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells epidermal basal cell layer of skin and basal layer of the nonkeratinized squamous epithelium of nasal oral mucosa and nasopharynx have ace2 expression ace2 is more strongly expressed in type ii epithelial cells glomerular tubules show ace2 low glomerular mesangial and glomerular endothelial cells do not express ace2 kupffer cells and hepatocytes spleen thymus lymph nodes bone marrow and b and t lymphocytes and macrophages do not show ace2
7
 
8
 ace2 tissue activity is higher than its plasma activity
9
 its activity can not be inhibited by traditional angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors aceis
3
 ace2 has a high affinity for ang ii
10
 and its catalytic efficiency for ang ii is 400 times greater than that for ang i ace2 may show differences in different ages and sexes
11
 
12

 lung tissue has high ras activity and is the leading site of ang ii synthesis ang ii is an effective pulmonary vasoconstrictor ras is activated during hypoxia ang ii can not only promote the growth response of vascular smooth muscle cells but also directly promote vascular remodeling and prevent pneumonia and shunts related to lung injury
13
 however ang ii can also promote the occurrence of pulmonary edema and impair lung function
14

 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is the most severe form of acute lung injury it is characterized mainly by increased pulmonary vascular permeability and pulmonary edema it is often induced by sepsis aspiration and pneumonia including that caused by sars coronavirus bird flu and human influenza viruses it is a clinical highdeathrate disease ace2 is highly expressed in the lung and imai et al
14
 confirmed the protective effect of ace2 in acute lung injury the ace2 protein in a mouse model induced by inhaled acidic gas was significantly downregulated while the ace level remained stable the inhalation of acidic gas significantly increased the levels of ang ii in the lung and plasma of wildtype mice and the levels of ang ii in the lung and plasma of acidinduced ace2 knockout ace2 ko mice were further increased recombinant human ace2 rhace2 protein treatment could reduce plasma ang ii levels and reduce acute lung injury in ace2 ko mice and wildtype mice a similar phenomenon was observed in a sepsis mouse model studies have further demonstrated that ang ii plays a role in acute lung injury via at1r ace2 is also one of the primary receptors for sarscov invasion into the human body
15
 what is puzzling is that sarscov infection leads to highly lethal pneumonia compared with other common cold symptoms after other coronavirus infections the researchers found that sarscovinfected or recombinant sarsspike proteintreated wildtype mice exhibited significantly reduced ace2 expression in the lungs these mice showed increased severity of pathological conditions in acute lung injury treating ace2 ko mice with sarsspike protein did not aggravate ards symptoms therefore the downregulation of ace2 expression in sarscov infection may play a causal role in the pathogenesis of sars which provides a reasonable explanation for the progression of sars patients into ards the recent outbreakcausing novel coronavirus pneumonia covid19 virus 2019ncov sarscov2 has also been shown to invade human alveolar epithelial cells through mainly ace2
16
 covid19 ards patients and sars patients have typical ards pathology in the lung
17
 we believe that sarscov2 and sarscov may share similar pathogenesis and pathological manifestations in the early outbreak of covid19 epidemiological analyses of 99 patients
18
 and 138 patients
19
 showed that the average age of patients was close to 56 years and that the incidence of infections in men was higher than that of infections in women nearly half of the cases were complicated by chronic underlying diseases hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease etc a retrospective analysis of 52 cases of severely ill patients in wuhan
20
 suggested that the severely ill patients were mainly middleaged and elderly individuals twothirds were male twothirds developed ards and approximately 40 had underlying diseases the total 28day case fatality rate reached 615 nanshan zhong et al
21
 published the data of 1099 covid patients the patients in the severe group were older than those in the nonsevere group and any chronic underlying diseases were more common in the severe group an analysis of the epidemiological characteristics of the most significant sample volume of 72 314 covid19 cases
22
 recently released by the chinese center for disease control and prevention suggests that deaths occur mainly in patients over 60 years of age with an increased mortality rate in men than in women and an increased mortality rate in patients with underlying diseases combining the results of existing studies we can conclude that men over 60 years of age with chronic underlying diseases hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease etc and secondary ards carry risk factors affecting the prognosis of covid19 mortality is directly related to these risk factors ace2 plays a vital role in ras ang ii promotes atherosclerosis in the cardiovascular system and promotes inflammation oxidative stress and migration of endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells
23
 ace2 has a protective effect on many diseases with reduced expression of ace2 such as hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular diseases because it antagonizes the role of ang ii
1

 ras activation is an important pathophysiological mechanism of hypertension and ras blockers are widely used their antihypertensive effect comes from reducing the role of ang ii on the one hand and from the ability of acei and at1r blockers angiotensin ii type 1 receptor blockers arbs to increase the circulating levels of ang 17
24
 studies have shown that the protective mechanism of ace2 against hypertension is most likely achieved by the degradation of ang ii
25
 studies by ferrario et al
26
 and others showed that ace2 levels increased by 47 and 28 times when blood pressure decreased after applying aceis lisinopril and arbs losartan to rats ace2 affects not only the development of hypertension but also potentially affects its response to treatment in rasblocked spontaneously hypertensive rats inhibition of the vascular effects of ang 17 may reduce the antihypertensive response to these drugs
24
 animal experiments have found that ang 17 infusion treatment can significantly improve vascular endothelial function and inhibit atherosclerotic lesion development in ang 17 transgenic apolipoprotein e knockout apoe ko mice receiving atherogenic highfat diets
27
 studies by thomas et al
28
 provided direct evidence for the occurrence and development of ace2 in atherosclerotic plaques it was also found that the ras blockade could prevent atherosclerosis in apoeace2 double knockout mice this study provided the basis for acei combined with ace2 treatment to reduce atherosclerosis ace2 can also antagonize cardiac fibrosis and ventricular remodeling caused by the longterm effects of ang ii wysocki et al
29
 kassiri et al
30
 and others provided strong evidence for the direct roles of ace2 and ang 17 in ventricular remodeling expression and regulation in diabetic nephropathy downregulation of renal tubular ace2 is associated with proteinuria and tubular damage
31
 and further inhibition of ace2 aggravates renal damage
32
 rhace2 can reduce blood pressure while reducing renal damage
33

 as ace2 provides a pathway for sarscov2 to invade the body it increases the chance of viral infection however aceis do not directly affect ace2 activity the use of aceis to instead increase ace2 activity has been shown in animal experiments this mixeduse enhances cardiovascular protection therefore we do not consider it appropriate for patients with covid19 to discontinue longterm ras blockers
34
 
35
 to determine whether aceiarb drugs can be used in patients who lack traditional indications prospective controlled studies are needed to provide evidence covid19 prognosis is related to age and sex the expression of ace2 decreases with increasing age ace2 expression is higher in young people than in elderly individuals and higher in females than in males
11
 
12
 this pattern does not match the characteristic of severely ill covid19 patients being mostly elderly males we believe that whether the level of ace2 expression is high or low is not a key factor affecting the prognosis of patients with covid19 the relationship between sex and prognosis requires additional data to verify the prognosis of severely ill patients with covid19 may be related to the decrease in ace2 activity in elderly patients with chronic underlying diseases sarscov2 infection reduces ace2 activity and receptor consumption further exacerbating pathophysiological mechanisms such as ang iiace2 regulation imbalance showed in figure 2 there are several potential approaches to address ace2mediated covid19 such as spike proteinbased vaccine rely on the fact that ace2 is the covid19 receptor inhibition of transmembrane protease activity essential for entry through interaction with ace2 receptor blocking ace2 receptor and delivering the soluble form of ace2 many studies have been conducted to explore the therapeutic potential of ace2 most likely the most clinically significant potential is the cardioprotective effect of rhace2 itself which has been proven as it can further enhance the vascular protective effect in patients using acei or arb drugs

 with ards were well tolerated after using rhace2 and they are most likely to represent the first clinical application in the field of ards ace2 is an essential part of the ras and it has extensive vascular and organ protection functions in hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease and ards similar to sarscov sarscov2 also invades the human body through ace2 according to existing research men over 60 years old with chronic underlying diseases hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease etc and secondary ards carry risk factors affecting the prognosis of covid19 there is currently no effective drug for the treatment of covid19 and we speculate that ace2 spike proteinbased vaccine and rhace2 may become one of the most promising approaches for future treatment and improve the

coronavirus covid-19 outbreak first reported on 8 december 2019 in hubei province in china was designated as a pandemic by the world health organization who on 11 march 2020 this disease recognized as an infection with a new betacoronavirus by dr zhang jixian from hubei provincial hospital of integrated chinese and western medicine has been spreading exponentially in almost all countries around the world the epicentre shifted from china to europe in februarymarch 2020 and then to the usa in marchapril 2020 current data presenting information on international case numbers and case fatality are provided by the johns hopkins university jhu coronavirus resource center httpswwwarcgiscomappsopsdashboardindexhtmlbda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf612 there are several other web-based resources that provide informative graphics on the spread of the disease and the outcomes the pandemic of covid-19 has multiple medical psychological and socio-economic consequences covid-19 represents probably the greatest threat that societies will face in the 21st century therefore understanding its pathophysiology and clinical implications and development of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies are of primary importance based on reviewing the available data in the public databases the risk of infection and mortality increases with advancing age and shows sexual dimorphism male elderly individuals are at the highest risk of infection as well as death despite the tropism for the lungs where it causes interstitial pneumonitis in the most severe cases multiorgan failure develops the cardiovascular cv system appears to have complex interactions with covid-19 published reports medrxiv biorxiv and personal communications and experience of the co-authors detail evidence of myocardial injury in 2040 of hospitalized cases manifesting as cardiac chest pain fulminant heart failure cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac death indeed symptoms of cardiac chest pain and palpitations are the presenting features in some patients36 while covid-19 is non-discriminatory involving both healthy persons and those with comorbid conditions approximately half of those admitted to hospitals in huabei province with covid-19 had known comorbidities the number of patients with comorbid conditions increased to about two-thirds in those requiring intensive care unit icu admission or those that did not survive patients with pre-existing cv conditions hypertension in particular had the highest morbidity 105 following infection78 non-cv comorbidities including diabetes lung diseases and obesity the latter identified in current italian and dutch cohorts are also major predictors of poor clinical outcomes similarly in the recent analysis of 5700 patients hospitalized with covid-19 in the new york city area the most common comorbidities were hypertension 57 obesity 42 and diabetes 34167 these aspects emphasize the importance of the need for multidisciplinary assessment and treatment including cv evaluation and therapy during the course of covid-19 to reduce mortality in this rapid review we summarize the state-of-the-art knowledge available currently regarding covid-19 focusing on key mechanistic and clinical aspects our understanding of covid-19 pathomechanisms natural clinical history and possible therapies are evolving continuously while in this review we have collated contemporary literature regarding this pandemic to enable a comprehensive overview numerous methodological considerations need to be taken into account regarding study design and data collection the sources used to generate this review are original articles published in pubmed posted on medrxiv biorxiv or chinaxiv or listed in clinical trial databases clinicaltrialgov and eudract in addition public databases such as world health organization centers for disease control crcs and the jhu coronavirus resource center were utilized the early studies in a pandemic might suffer from inclusion bias baseline demographics and pre-morbid status of study populations are expected to reflect the characteristics of individuals who were exposed to the disease early in the outbreak in addition availability and access to diagnostic testing as well as a high threshold for diagnostic testing or hospital treatment or suitability for icu admission because of finite resources are expected to affect characteristics of the study populations and the clinical outcomes of the disease for example a large number of healthcare workers and inpatients were exposed to covid-19 in the hospital in the early rather than the later phase in the pandemic in china21 the demographics of patients in the early studies from china were different from those reported later in the largest aggregate study of covid-19 patients by guan et al in china22 table 1 data on cardiac involvement are unfortunately not extensively presented in the study of guan et al22 the national health commission of the peoples republic of china prc guidance23 recommends the use of traditional chinese medicine alongside what is considered more conventional interventions the published reports do not provide details of the traditional treatment regimens in patients with covid-19 therefore different choices of therapy were made and any positivenegative impacts of such interventions which may have influenced outcomes might have introduced additional bias finally it is also difficult to assess the true prevalence occurrence mortality and spectrum of the clinical course of disease since a proportion of inoculated individuals might be asymptomatic and therefore were never tested some in silico modelling of the infection expansion as well as in initial reports from iceland and italy suggest that an asymptomatic group perhaps as high as 50 of infected individuals decode genetics iceland probably exists this finding has considerable implications in estimating the prevalence and preventing spread of the disease likewise some reports show that up to 80 of infected individuals have mild symptoms and in theory represent a group that might not seek medical carethey might not therefore be tested or contribute to prevalence and case fatality rate cfr estimates secondly practically all countries experience shortage of the testing kits therefore limiting the testing only to selected groups of individuals moreover some deaths caused by sars-cov-2 were not attributed to covid-19 due to the lag time when severe complications tend to develop even up to 23 weeks following the initial infection8 the incubation period between contact and the first set of symptoms is typically 114 days but up to 24 days in individual cases23 the median time between registered exposure and first symptoms is 51 days with a mean of 61 days24 duration of viral nucleic acid shedding ranges between 8 and 34 days median 20 days after the initial symptoms figure 3
 the main clinical symptoms develop within 115 days 95 confidence interval ci 82156 days and include fever dry cough fatigue ageusia anosmia and headache24 other non-specific symptoms have also been reported which included nasal congestion rhinorrhea sore throat myalgia poor appetite and diarrhoea21 fever and cough typically appear concomitantly followed by shortness of breath and severe fatigue which appear around day 676 and are associated with development of severe bilateral and occasional unilateral pneumonia figure 4
 the most common radiological findings include multiple patchy shadows and interstitial changes in moderate disease with consolidation a ground glass appearance in 564 of cases22 and very occasional pleural effusions in severe cases23 in such severe cases pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax have been described2526 pathological investigations of the lungs of deceased individuals indicate blockade of bronchi and bronchioles with large amounts of mucus plugs and bronchial epithelial cell damage23 lymphocyte and mononuclear cell infiltrates are present in alveolar septal spaces fibrinous exudate and high hyaline membranes fill alveolar cavities polynuclear giant cells are prominent there is marked proliferation of type ii alveolar epithelial cells such severe manifestations appear only in a fraction of patients a recent study of covid-19 cases in china reported up to 28 january 2020 indicated that severe illness may occur in 16 of cases22 leading to an overall mortality rate estimated at 14 of the total reported cases22 to 461 in the who reports accessed on 28 march 2020 in some geographical regions due to unexplained reasons mortality may be higher current estimates are 119 in italy 90 in spain and 79 in the uk according to the jhu coronavirus resource center accessed on 2 april 20202 it is important to note however that great care must be taken when calculating fatality rates based on currently available data as these can be overestimated in relation to insufficient testing in the community or underestimated due to long lag-time between test positivity and death or the fact that there are large differences in attributing covid-related mortality dying with versus dying from as well as differences in performing post-mortem testing limitations of healthcare systems abruptly overwhelmed by a surge of patients needing mechanical invasive ventilation have also been considered a potential source of the differences finally these differences may result from population structure as italian patients have been older than the average age reported in the chinese patients the typical clinical course of disease is summarized in figure 3 the heterogeneity of responses between individual patients is striking this indicates that it is unlikely that covid-19 can be considered from the point of view of a single disease phenotype rather it seems most likely that host characteristics which at the moment remain unknown promote progression of the disease with a range of different presentarions eg mild severe multiorgan failure and cytokine release storm while clinical symptoms of the disease are predominantly respiratory and associated with severe pneumonia both direct and indirect involvement of other organs is common with the cv system being particularly affected moreover pre-existing conditions largely linked to cvd increase the risk of severe outcomes of the infection a number of key comorbidities are associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19 table 1 association with age seems to dominate this relationship22 and may affect the actual importance of other factors reported in univariate analyses older patients mean age 63 years old range 5371 are more likely to experience the composite endpoint of icu admission mechanical ventilation or death compared with younger patients mean age 46 years old range 355722 table 1 males seem to be more susceptible to covid-19-related complications representing between 50 and 82 of the hospitalized patients in the four publications that report these data table 1 and the most recent report from italy27 
table 1 summarizes key comorbidities identified by the major studies from china showing that the presence of pre-existing morbidities increases the severity of hospital-treated covid-19 notably there is a large heterogeneity of reporting with some studies comparing death with survival and others comparing icu with non-icu cases table 1 however regardless of the approach pre-existing cv conditions seem to be particularly important predictors of covid-19 severity the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team recently analysed all covid-19 cases reported to chinas infectious disease information system up to 11 february 20207 the investigators found that the fatality rate for patients with no comorbidities was 09 whereas the cfr was much higher for patients with comorbidities this included mortality of 105 for patients with cvd 73 for those with diabetes 6 for subjects with hypertension 63 for those with chronic respiratory disease and 60 for those with cancer2830 it was as high as 148 for patients 80 years of age730 it is interesting that in italian and dutch cohorts there are reports of higher severity in younger obese individuals as well severe cases accounted for 138 and critical cases accounted for 47 of all cases of significance cvd occurrence affects the mortality rate to a larger extent than the presence of pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd which had not been the case in sars7 these observations are confirmed by a recent meta-analysis based largely on these studies and an additional 44 672 patient data set reported by the china cdc28 in this large cohort cvd was reported in 42 of the total population and in 227 of those who died28 by extension it is expected that comorbidities are associated with higher rates of hospitalization in patients with covid-19 but any effects that comorbidities may have on susceptibility to infection remain conjectural accordingly published frequencies of these comorbidities in china are included in table 1 surprisingly a history of smoking and of chronic pulmonary disease appear to be far less powerful determinants of severity in hospitalized patients than is the history of cvd curiously the prevalence of smoking in hospitalized covid-19 patients appears far lower than might be expected from assumed population prevalence and primary respiratory infection it is not clear if hypertension is a risk factor for susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infectionthe available data show prevalence rates of 1540 largely in line with the rates of high blood pressure in the general population 302231 at first glance hypertension is more prevalent in subjects with a more severe course of the disease in a recent analysis from china22 it was present in 134 of subjects with non-severe disease and in 237 of subjects with severe disease this study also included a composite outcome which was also associated with a higher prevalence of hypertension in those with a poor composite outcome 358 vs 137 in the cohort of 44 672 patients reported by the china cdc28 hypertension prevalence was reported as 128 in the whole group of patients and as 397 in patients who eventually died28 hypertension was reported to increase the odds ratio or for death by 305 95 ci 15759232 in patients with covid-19 these associations may however be largely confounded by the higher prevalence of hypertension in older people as older individuals have significantly worse outcomes more severe course of the disease and a higher mortality rate than the younger patients22 thus in summary while hypertension does appear to be associated with more severe disease a higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and increased mortality in unadjusted analyses there is no strong evidence to indicate increased susceptibility of patients with hypertension to covid-19 when the association is adjusted for other risk factors33 the mechanisms of this possible relationship and their clinical relevance have been reviewed in a recent statement of the european society of hypertension33 the putative relationship between hypertension and covid-19 may relate to the role of ace2 ace2 is a key element in the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas which is critically involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension34 experimental studies demonstrated that inhibition of the raas with ace inhibitors aceis or angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs may result in a compensatory increase in tissue levels of ace235 leading to suggestions that these drugs may be detrimental in patients exposed to sars-cov-236 it is important however to emphasize that there is no clear evidence that aceis or arbs lead to up-regulation of ace2 in human tissues36 thus currently there is no justification for stopping aceis or arbs in patients at risk of covid-1933 this has now been endorsed officially by many learned societies including the european society of hypertension the international society of hypertension and the european society of cardiology33 it also appears that in experimental models some raas blockers may exert a potentially protective influence37 indeed while angiotensin ii promoted the internalization and intracellular degradation of ace2 losartan reduced this effect suggesting that arbs may offer protection against viral entry into cells36 the recent integrative antiviral drug repurposing analysis implicated another arbirbesartanas a potential repurposable medication for covid-1910 in fact the known effect of arbs on potassium metabolism may be seen as clinically advantageous in patients infected by covid-19 given that hypokalaemia was reported as a fairly common manifestation of covid-19 possibly through increased kaliuresis rather than gastrointestinal loss38 hypokalaemia in covid-19 patients is difficult to manage correlates with the severity of the disease and has been suggested to be driven by activation of the raas38 aceis or arbs might offer some protection in this setting it also needs to be emphasized that hypokalaemia has not been reported in other studies for example in a patient characterization by guan et al22 the median value of the potassium level reported was 38 mmoll with the lower margin of the interquartile range iqr at 35 mmoll nevertheless antihypertensive medications known to increase serum levels of potassium including carvedilol and eplerenone were implicated as potential drug repurposing opportunities for patients with covid-19 infection10 moreover observations from icus in italy suggest that hypocalcaemia is a common metabolic abnormality in patients infected by covid-19 that could be linked due to reduced albumin levels which are commonly seen andor ca2 consumption through excessive activation of the coagulation cascade another mechanism linking hypertension and covid-19 is the immune system which is dysregulated in hypertension and sars-cov-2 infection3940 poor control of blood pressure may contribute to further dysregulation of the immune system for example it has been shown that hypertension in humans is associated with circulating lymphocyte counts41 and cd8 t cell dysfunction is observed in patients with hypertension42 such immunosenescent cd8 t cells are unable to efficiently combat viral infections and contribute to pathological overproduction of cytokinesa situation providing a possible link to covid-19 one may also postulate that aceis or arbs by providing a better control of blood pressure may restore at least partially the dysregulated immune system in hypertension overall it is essential to ensure that blood pressure control in hypertensive patients during viral infections is optimized unnecessary and uncontrolled changes to therapy are discouraged and hypertensive patients should be carefully monitored for cv and other complications during covid-19 infection severe covid-19 is associated with rapidly progressing systemic inflammation a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm and sepsis leading to multiorgan failure and death figure 5 selected evidence and manifestations of cv injury in covid-19 patients are summarized in table 2 importantly there is a delay between initiation of symptoms and myocardial damage in studies reported so far table 3
 viral infections are associated with metabolic dysfunction myocardial inflammation and activation of the sympathetic nervous system all of which predispose to cardiac arrhythmia in a recent report on 138 hospitalized covid-19 patients21 167 of patients developed arrhythmias which ranked only second among serious complications after ards arrhythmia was observed in 7 of patients who did not require icu treatment and in 44 of subjects who were admitted to an icu18 further details of these manifestations remain elusive but included atrial fibrillation conduction block ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation these arrhythmias are also observed in viral myocarditis interestingly the report of the national health commission of china estimates that during the initial outbreak some patients reported primarily cv symptoms such as palpitations and chest tightness rather than respiratory symptoms43 most reports indicate that almost all hospitalized covid-19 patients show elevated serum creatine kinase ck and lactate dehydrogenase ldh levels64344 in addition a number of studies indicate that cardiac complications including fulminant myocarditis are potential outcomes of sars-cov-2 infection heart failure has been reported as an outcome in 23 of covid subjects in a recent report from in-hospital chinese subjects approximately 52 of non-survivors had heart failure as compared with 12 of survivors32 evidence of myocardial injury such as an increase in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i ctni levels 28 pgml was detected in 5 of the first 41 patients diagnosed with covid-19 in wuhan64344 more recent reports indicate that 7221 to 1732 of hospitalized covid-19 patients sustain acute myocardial injury this may be in the form of acute myocarditis see below or injury secondary to an oxygen supplydemand mismatch type 2 myocardial infarction mi in an analysis of 68 fatal cases in wuhan 36 patients 53 died of respiratory failure 5 7 patients with myocardial damage died from circulatory failure and 22 patients 33 died from both3 similarly analysis of 120 covid-19 patients reported elevated levels of n-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide nt-probnp in 275 of the cases and ctni in 10 of deceased patients respectively indicating that the effects of cv injury on systemic stability may be important and should not be ignored in another report of 138 inpatients with covid-19 in wuhan the levels of biomarkers of myocardial injury were significantly higher in patients treated in the icu as compared with those not requiring icu care median ck-mb level 18 ul vs 14 ul p  0001 hs-ctni level 110 pgml vs 51 pgml p  000421 in a study of 191 patients32 ctni levels were strongly associated with increased mortality in the univariate analysis but the association was not tested in a multivariate model similar associations between ctni elevation and disease severity are shown when analysing cohorts on the basis of the need for icu care621 thus patient monitoring should include a number of laboratory tests summarized in table 4 based on current experience and studies
 mechanisms underlying myocardial injury remain unknown and it is unclear whether they reflect systemiclocal andor ischaemicinflammatory process it is still not known whether acute injury is a primary infective phenomenon or secondary to lung disease associations between ctni elevation and pre-existing cv conditions and other pre-covid features have not yet been examined to detect evidence of causality and no detailed analyses of patients with cv complications of covid-19 have been published to date as an elevated ctni level is associated with poorer outcomes in other non-covid systemic illnesses45 the reported association could simply reflect the severity of systemic illness eg hypoxia or hypotension rather than indicating a specific cardiac pathology in this context a cytokine storm triggered by immunological dysregulation43 may be a key mediator plasma interleukin-6 il-6 concentrations are elevated in covid-19 patients with cardiac injury46 and abnormalities in a variety of cytokines are prominent in patients with severe covid-19 disease cardiac-specific mechanisms may also be important since ace2 is expressed in the cv system47 direct cardiomyocyte infection by sars-cov-2 may be a possibility as discussed below moreover therapies used in treatment of severe multiorgan dysfunction in covid-19 patients as well as antiviral drugs may result in cardiac toxicity attempts to treat covid-19 cardiac injury have included the use of steroids iv immunoglobins hydroxychloroquine and other antivirals and active mechanical life support46 while it remains uncertain if these or other therapies successfully limit myocardial injury the detection of cardiac damage in hospitalized covid-19 patients may help identify a subset of patients at greater risk of covid-19 complications cardiac injury and acute myocarditis are well-recognized complications of acute viral infections myocyte necrosis and mononuclear cell infiltrates are reported in cardiac muscle autopsy specimens in a recent report of the national health commission of the prc23 this finding along with case reports4648 of fulminant myocarditis suggests that myocarditis may be an important cause of the acute cardiac injury in covid-19 patients however the prevalence clinical importance and mechanisms of myocardial inflammation in covid-19 disease remain unclear649 clinically covid-19 myocarditis may manifest only as mild chest discomfort and palpitations which may be impossible to distinguish from other causes in most patients in some however myocarditis results in fulminant disease figure 6 transient ecg changes are common and may help detect the presence and severity of myocardial injury myocarditis may progress to conduction block tachyarrhythmias and impairment of left ventricular function
 in other clinical settings myocarditis is often suspected when cardiac injury is detected in the absence of an acs the diagnosis can often be confirmed if cardiac magnetic resonance imaging mri detects typical acute myocardial injury signals50 endomyocardial biopsy emb long considered the gold standard diagnostic test can directly demonstrate myocyte necrosis and mononuclear cell infiltrates51 emb will detect evidence of a viral cause in some cases though in others an immunologically autoimmune-mediated cause of the myocarditis is suspected51 biopsy studies of patients with acute myocarditis in europe indicate that viral aetiology ranges between 378 and 7745253 in covid-19 this evidence is at the moment sparse and based on individual case series emphasizing the need for systematic assessment while several reports emphasize that fulminant myocarditis may be an important clinical presentation of the disease4648 the real prevalence of this complication remains unclear cardiac mri and embs as diagnostic tools are likely to be inappropriate during the current covid-19 pandemic and associated healthcare crisis but should be considered in the future table 5
 animal models of viral myocarditis suggest discrete pathological phases that begin with viral-mediated myocyte lysis54 this cardiac injury leads to activation of the innate immune response with release of proinflammatory cytokines54 proteins released through cell lysis might display epitopes similar to the viral antigens and be presented via the major histocompatibility complex mhc myosin heavy chain a cardiac sarcomere protein appears to be a prime example of molecular mimicry55 at this stage embs may show inflammatory changes but no detectable viral particles because of clearance of the virus by the innate immune response an acquired immune response is the predominant feature evidenced by activation of antibodies and t lymphocytes cd4 t helper th cells and cytotoxic cd8 t cells mediate their responses through activation of the inflammatory cascade and cytolysis th1interferon ifn- th2  eg il-4 th17  il-17 and th22  il-22 macrophages migrate to the site of injury54 in the final stage there is either recovery or low levels of chronic inflammation with concomitant development of left ventricular dysfunction54 interestingly myocarditis appears in covid-19 patients after a prolonged period up to 1015 days after the onset of symptoms table 3 moreover investigators in china point to a lack of viral particle identification on emb personal communication given these observations and the experimental context above a question central to potential therapeutic options is the extent to which myocardial injury results from viral replication cytopathic is immune mediated or is due to other mechanisms given that acute myocardial injury is said to begin 2 weeks after the onset of symptomatic covid-1932 adaptive t-cell-mediated immunity or dysregulated innate effector pathways are likely to play a pivotal in the development of myocardial inflammation in this context it is notable that an increase of highly proinflammatory ccr6 th17 in cd4 t cells prominent inflammatory mediators of myocarditis56 has been reported in severe cases together the data suggest that a delay in myocardial inflammation is consistent with at least two pathogenic mechanisms first that the cytokine storm unleashes a subclinical autoimmune myocarditis and secondly that myocardial damage andor molecular mimicry initiate a de novo autoimmune reaction targeted therapeutic options remain elusive as is the case for myocarditis in other settings a management strategy that uses a broad range of supportive therapies remains key a case report recently described effectiveness of the early application of steroids and iv immunoglobins neuraminidase inhibitors and active mechanical life support46 while little is known regarding the effects of covid-19 on acs several pathways associated with viral diseases may contribute to destabilize plaques in covid-19 patients57 heart failure patients are at increased risk of acute events or exacerbation viral illness can potentially destabilize atherosclerotic plaques through systemic inflammatory responses58 cytokine storm as well as specific changes of immune cell polarization towards more unstable phenotypes all of these have been observed in covid-19 in the case of sars and mers acute mi5960 has been reported in two out of the five deaths in early reports61 it is important to consider that type 2 mi is the most common subtype in viral conditions thus the usefulness of invasive management with a view toward coronary revascularization especially in type 2 mi is limited the decision for invasive vs non-invasive management of patients with an acs and covid-19 illness should be carefully considered moreover a recent single-cell atlas of the human heart indicated that pericytes express particularly high levels of ace2 in the heart47 one of the implications of this finding is possible local microvascular inflammation during sars-cov-2 infection of the pericytes leading to severe microvascular dysfunction contributing to myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries minoca this could explain recent reports of the clinical course of cases of mi during covid-19 in addition the cytokine storm can contribute to development of endothelial dysfunction through well-characterized mechanisms6265 features of disseminated intravascular coagulation dic and pulmonary embolism characterized by increased d-dimer levels and fibrin degradation products are highly prevalent in covid-19 dic has been observed in 714 of non-survivors66 massive pulmonary embolism has been reported67 this might not be surprising given the critical condition of these subjects although early appearance of dic features is often evident notably experience from china indicates that a d-dimer increase is highly predictive of adverse outcomes in covid-19 in a retrospective cohort study elevated d-dimer levels 1 gl were strongly associated with in-hospital mortality and this relationship was maintained in multivariate analysis or 184 95 ci 261286 p  000332 moreover chinese and italian experience emphasizes that more discrete changes in d-dimer levels are observed earlier in the course of disease preceding the rapid progression stage after the lungs immune organs are the second most affected system by covid-19 pathological investigations in covid-19 victims23 have demonstrated splenic atrophy with a very significant reduction in the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils as well as necrosis and haemorrhages similarly lymphocytes are depleted in lymph nodes and the numbers of both cd4 and cd8 cells are decreased23 this corresponds to lymphopenia in peripheral blood observed in severe cases interestingly an increase in systemic il-2 il-6 il-7 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor c-x-c motif chemokine 10 cxcl10 chemokine c-c motif ligand 2 ccl2 and tumour necrosis factor- tnf- has been observed in subjects with covid-196 which corresponds to the characteristics of a cytokine release syndrome crs166869 crs development in covid-19 is associated with covid-19 severity crs has been characterized as a complication of immune targeted therapies in oncology in particular in relation to severe chimeric antigen receptor car t-cell-induced crs70 it is also reminiscent of the cytokine profile noted in haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh syndromes71 resemblance to the latter brought considerations that covid-19 may be a cause of secondary hlh with cytopenias significant haemophagocytosis in bone marrow and low fibrinogen concentration clinical classifications have been introduced to aid recognition of secondary hhl71 fluorescence-activated cell sorting facs analyses of covid-19 active cases have also shown hyperactivated t lymphocytes with large fractions of hla-dr and cd38 cd8cd4 t cells and ccr6 th17 cd4 cells high concentrations of cytotoxic granules in cytotoxic t cd8 cells have been observed thus uncontrolled overactivation of t cells may account for in part the severe immune injury16 similarly to atherosclerosis and other cv conditions7273 these aspects should also be considered in the light of sexual dimorphism related to susceptibility to cv inflammation7476 high serum il-6 levels are a common feature in crs patients indeed in a recent retrospective multicentre analysis of 150 patients from wuhan circulating il-6 levels were a clinical predictor of mortality in covid-193 il-6 is an important biomarker and possible target for cv morbidity and mortality linked to atherosclerosis7779 this is important as therapeutic targeting of the il-6 receptor il-6r with tocilizumab is used in preventing and treating crs caused by cancer therapies and hlh70 tocilizumab is approved in 100 countries for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ra juvenile idiopathic arthritis jia80 castlemans diseases and giant cell or takayasu arteritis81 other il-6r-targeting agents eg sarilumab are similarly potentially of use therefore its possible use in covid-19 may be attractive to tackle crs however when considering immunomodulation one has to bear in mind that the primary problem is an infectious disease rather than the complications of cancer therapy therefore its potentially utility must be carefully considered during the initial outbreak in china the use of tocilizumab to stop severe crs-associated organ failure and death in covid-19 patients was attempted71 twenty-one severe covid-19 cases were treated with tocilizumab in an initial pilot trial nineteen of them were discharged from the hospital within 2 weeks as reported by chinas national health commission the drug has now been approved in china to treat patients developing severe complications from covid-19 and showing elevated plasma levels of il-682 chinese researchers have now registered several clinical trials for tocilizumab expected to enrol patients with covid-19 very soon a partial list includes a multicenter randomized controlled trial for the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia covid-19 chictr2000029765 tocilizumab vs crrt in management of cytokine release syndrome crs in covid-19 tacos clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04306705 and favipiravir combined with tocilizumab in the treatment of corona virus disease 2019 clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04310228 similarly case reports originating from italy show that in a case series of six patients treated with tocilizumab in naples three have shown signs of improvement this has prompted several studies evaluating the role of il-6 antagonism by monoclonal antibodies in covid-19 for example the italian medicines agency aifa approved the clinical study tocilizumab in covid-19 pneumonia tocivid-19 clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04317092 this multicentre single-arm open-label phase ii study will assess mortality at 1 month in 330 patients affected by covid-19 pneumonia the inclusion criteria comprise patients showing signs

evaluate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia covacta clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04320615 is being initiated similar trials have been registered in france belgium and denmark it should be noted however that there are currently no published clinical trial data on il-6 targeting safety or efficacy against the virus moreover tocilizumab has not received approval from chinas national medical product administration to be sold for covid-19 treatment the cytokine storm and increase in il-6 signalling observed in some covid-19 patients could have profound cv consequences causing tachycardia hypotension and left ventricular dysfunction crs-related cardiotoxicity has also been reported mainly in the form of conduction abnormalities atrial fibrillation and elevation in bnp and ctnis83 in covid-19 patients medium- to long-term cv consequences may be caused by increased il-6 signalling experimental evidence supports an atherogenic role for il-6 and crs-related cytokines59608486 as well as its effects on cardiac fibrosis and failure87 the cytokine increases adhesion molecule expression in human endothelial cells in vitro88 at the same time stimulation of human macrophages with oxidized ldls oxldls leads to increased release of il-689 in experimental atherosclerosis il-6 mrna is detectable in the aorta of hyperlipidaemic mice90 and administration of recombinant il-6 increased plaque formation91 similarly reduced pathology has been observed in ldlr mice treated with a fusion protein of the il-6 trans-signalling inhibitor soluble glycoprotein 130 sgp13092 plasma il-6 levels also have been associated with development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm93 and il-6 has been shown to influence lipid homeostasis in mice94 il-6 trans-signalling contributes to experimental cardiac fibrosis87 while the up-regulation of membrane-bound il-6r causes vascular remodelling in pulmonary arterial hypertension95 genetic variants leading to increased circulating levels of il-6r and therefore reduced il-6 cell signalling have been shown to protect against coronary heart disease chd9697 similarly il-6 trans-signalling is associated with increased cv risk7798 il-6 is routinely used as an inflammatory biomarker in cv disease the canakinumab anti-inflammatory thrombosis outcomes study cantos trial demonstrated a stronger effect of il-1 inhibition in reducing secondary cv events in patients with higher circulating levels of il-6 and c-reactive protein crp indicative of residual inflammatory risk98 whether the observed cytokine storm and il-6 increase in covid-19 patients are transient or sustained remains unknown accordingly monitoring inflammatory biomarkers in these patients in the medium to long term is of major importance similarly cv risk should be closely evaluated during the acute phase response and in the following years there are however likely to be a range of additional cytokine moieties that will emerge to have pathway-specific contributions in the severe spectrum of covid-19 syndrome these include pathways driven by granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf tnf- il-17 il-18 and ifn- moreover the imminent prospect of single-cell and other immunological analyses will offer a more systematic insight into the immune dysregulation syndromes that are emerging and especially the disease trajectoryin essence which pathways are directing covid-related crs and which are simply adding to the inflammatory tissue damage burden upon which the other comorbidities are operating thus we propose that a useful way of thinking about this would be that the inflammatory burden might be considered as a direct effector ie crs-type or a secondary amplificatory factor in terms of the contribution that pathways make to pathogenesis and clinical outcome in 2002 a novel coronavirus sars-cov emerged from china crossing from bats to humans eventually leading to 8000 cases and the death of 700 people sars utilized ace2 for cell attachment and infection through the viral envelope spike s protein99 and a subsequent interaction with a cellular protease tmprss2 which primes s protein for cell entry10 the closely related sars-cov-2 also thought to have originated in bats9 encodes an s protein with 76 amino acid similarity to that of sars-cov and importantly sars-cov-2 as already discussed has also recently been demonstrated to use the same cellular entry pathway via ace2 and tmprss212 as discussed above both these novel coronaviruses are different from another recently emergent coronavirus mers virus which crossed from the dromedary camel to humans and also caused acute respiratory failure although utilizing a different cell entry mechanism via the receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4101 overall this highlights the potential divergence of respiratory coronavirus infections in humans but emphasizes the close relationship between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 so what can we learn from knowledge of sars-cov and associated cv risk to help in the current battle against covid-19 during human sars-cov infection of the murine lung ace2 is utilized and subsequently almost completely lost at the protein level102 importantly delivery of the viral s protein alone also led to down-regulation of ace2 and decreased lung function in normal mice and worsened lung pathology in an acid challenge model of acute lung failure furthermore disease pathology was reduced in the presence of the arb losartan intriguingly in acute lung disease triggered by acid respiration or sepsis ace2 has also been shown to be directly protective acting in partnership with the angiotensin type 2 receptor at2r and administration of recombinant ace2 in this model is protective103 taking together the evidence from multiple experimental studies beneficial effects of aceis or arbs and also ace2 supplementation in various animal models of lung injury or sars have been shown and supported the concept that loss of ace2 expression promotes the disease in lung injury models reviewed in kreutz et al 202025 ace2 is also directly regulated by cytokines104 decreased ace2 levels could be a direct consequence of viral infection andor the subsequent inflammatory and immune responses that occur in the infected lung interestingly ace2 is also reported to be detectable in macrophages105 and its knockout in leucocytes promotes adipose inflammation106 highlighting a role for ace2 in the inflammatory response patients suffering from sars have overwhelming immune and inflammatory responses and high mortality rates from acute respiratory failure and furthermore they are also associated cardiac sequelae for example sars patients also suffer from systolic and diastolic dysfunction and arrythmias leading to sudden death107108 in murine models intranasal administration of human sars-cov results in ace2-mediated infection of the myocardium109 these observations support a role for sars-cov in direct myocardial infection and a possible causative role in cardiac disease subsequent to respiratory infection in the murine heart ace2 was also almost completely down-regulated at the protein level following infection moreover in autopsied cardiac tissue from sars patients with sars-cov-positive lung infection viral rna was detected in the heart combined with decreased cardiac ace2 protein levels and elevated cardiac macrophage infiltration down-regulation of ace2 without compensatory effects on ace may lead to the raas being tipped towards the detrimental aceang iiat1r axis and away from the protective ace2ang-1-7mas axis ace2 is also up-regulated after mi in rodents and humans in macrophages endothelial cells smooth muscle cells110111 and cardiomyocytes112 and may play a role in restoring raas homeostasis in the heart post-mi in fact viral vector-mediated overexpression of ace2 in rodents also protects the heart from adverse cardiac remodelling and dysfunction post-mi113 overall these findings highlight that ace2 has a key protective function in both the lung and the heart therefore sars-cov infection-mediated down-regulation of ace2 as a direct mechanistic consequence of viral infection andor as a result of the subsequent inflammatory responses may lead to an imbalance in raas signalling and consequent cv sequelae the knowledge that systemic spread of sars from primary lung infection to other cv tissues including the heart is also important given that ace2 functions as a receptor for virus entry into the cell down-regulation of ace2 upon infectioin with sars-cov is expected to prevent further viral entry serving as a negative regulatory mechanism clearly additional investigations are needed to increase our understanding of the pathological mechanisms of acute disease and potential increased cv risk in covid-19 patients managing covid-19 is challenging as there are no specific treatments for the sars-cov-2 virus obtaining high-quality randomized clinical trial data during an outbreak is difficult research and clinical efforts focus in parallel on development of new drugs against coronavirus as well as repurposing already approved drugs for the treatment of the disease clinicaltrialsgov site lists 300 studies that are testing various interventions in covid-19 patients this emphasis on trials as opposed to compassionate use and case reports is a major lesson from previous pandemics and it is good to see the community moving so robustly in this direction meanwhile public health measures rely mostly on social measures intended to prevent viraldisease spread in order to avoid a massive surge of patients with healthcare facilities overload and on supportive treatment for the patients which can be considered the mainstay of management available treatments once clinically evident can be classified as supportive immune-suppressive antiretroviral and potential novel therapies supportive treatment should be the mainstay of management coordinated by the relevant specialistmultidisciplinary team the approaches have been provided by numerous scientific and clinical societies during the early stages of the european outbreak and are continuously being updated this includes a concise but comprehensive guidelines of the societ italiana di anestesia analgesia rianimazione e terapia intensiva114 when disease progresses to severe phenotype supportive treatment includes use of oxygen therapy if spo2 is 92 on room air23 as well as haemodynamic support early intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation are essential in those with progressive symptoms and increasing oxygen requirement high flow nasal cannulae and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation nippv may play a role in some patients especially where resources for mechanical ventilation are likely to be stretched a lung-protective ventilation strategy is recommended by the who conservative use of iv fluids aiming to maintain tissue perfusion but a negative fluid balance aids lung recovery23 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo may be required in severe cases as per standard indications but should be considered early veno-venous mode and could be initiated prior to intubation as cardiac damage is highly prevalent heart failure therapies should be initiated where appropriate similarly broad-spectrum antibioticsantifungal treatments and treatment of arrhythmias are needed finally due to the growing evidence of dic as a cause of organ injury anticoagulation should be considered23 approximately 75 of patients in the early chinese cohort received antiviral therapy63243115 the italian recommendation is to commence treatment with antiviral therapy when covid-19 is confirmed in patients with mild symptoms but not in a high mortality risk category or with moderatesevere signs of infection numerous antiviral therapies have been used to try and limit viral replication these include protease inhibitors such as liponovirritonavir used for the treatment of hiv however a recent rapid randomized non-placebo-controlled trial including 100 patients in each arm showed no difference in the outcome116 remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue and polymerase inhibitor that was previously used for the experimental treatment of ebola in a large phase iii study117 while it had an acceptable safety profile the remdesivir gs-5734 arm was halted due to a higher antiviral efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in the trial finally chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have been suggested as having antiviral activity against many rna viruses including sars and sars-cov-2 through an increase of the endosomal ph and interference with the glycosylation process118 however it has never been shown conclusively to have an antiviral effect in vivo in alphavirus infection while demonstrating an antiviral effect in vitro it was found not to be associated with clinical effects in a randomized clinical trial and may even be associated with prolonged viraemia in vivo119 while these observations cannot be directly translated to covid-19 large phase iii trials are underway with hydroxychloroquine that will inform about the possible therapeutic value of this approach this includes the recently initiated hydroxychloroquine chemoprophylaxis in healthcare personnel in contact with covid-19 patients phydra trial clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04318015 as the cytokine storm appears to be a key pathogenetic process in patients exhibiting rapid deterioration immune suppression and immune modulation approaches have been tried this includes glucocorticoids which are recommended by chinese guidelines but not italian guidelines patients with evidence of lung fibrosis or severe cardiac involvement in the icu may benefit from this approach methylprednisolone was used in combination with iv immunoglobulins in the treatment of subjects with fulminant myocarditis118 immunomodulatory therapies used include monoclonal antibodies against il-6r discussed above ifn- registered for treatment of multiple sclerosis enhances suppressor t cell activity reducing proinflammatory cytokine production it may be also helpful in patients with myocarditis who develop left ventricular systolic dysfunction however current experience is limited to enteroviruses120 it is also being tried as an inhaled preparation finally 27 of patients in the early chinese cohort received iv immunoglobulins this approach was based on the evidence of their beneficial effects in cases of myocarditis-induced dilated cardiomyopathy and is recommended in cases of viral myocarditis that are refractory to standard heart failure therapies121 a list of planned ongoing and completed clinical trials can be found at httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2resultscondcovid-19termcntrystatecitydist in addition to the many ongoing clinical trials a new trial in europe will investigate effects of apn01 the recombinant form of human ace2 rhace2 clinicaltrialsarenacom hrace2 has a dual mode of action first it has the potential to block infection of host cells by sars-cov-2 and secondly it may reduce lung injury through the protective actions of endogenous ace2 the phase ii clinical trial will be conducted in germany austria and denmark the potential therapies for covid-19 discussed above have important cv side effects and toxicities as well as comorbid conditions that require caution or avoidance of these drugs as listed in table 6 it should be noted that data for these side effects and toxicities come from patients that use these drugs chronically for the treatment of autoimmune diseases chloroquinehydroxychloroquine rocilizumab hepatitis ribavarin ifn- or hiv infection lopinivirritonivir thus the effect of short-term use of these medications for patients without these underlying conditions is not clear remdesivir is an experimental drug used in the treatment of ebola117 thus its cv effects and toxicities are unknown the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have recently received considerable attention and interest for the treatment and possible prophylaxis of covid-19 however the data to date in support of these drugs are weak and cardiac toxicities are considerable a systematic review of the literature performed on patients treated with these drugs albeit for an extended period of time median 7 years and with a high cumulative dose demonstrated conduction disorders as the main side effect 85122 other adverse cardiac events included ventricular hypertrophy 22 hypokinesia 94 heart failure 268 pulmonary arterial hypertension 39 and valvular dysfunction 71 cardiac function normalizes in a significant number of patients 449 upon withdrawal of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine while others continue to show irreversible damage 129 or death 308122 thus careful consideration should be given to the use of these drugs particularly without stronger data regarding their efficacy of note tocilizumab treatment has been shown to influence lipid metabolism in ra patients following tocilizumab total- ldl- and hdl-cholesterol were increased while cv risk biomarkers such as hdl-saa secretory phospholipase a2 iia and lipoproteina were significantly reduced123 very recently the entrace clinical trial supported the cv safety of tocilizumab in ra patients124 however to date il-6 targeting has not been tested for secondary prevention in cvd
 while there are currently no evidence-based recommendations considering clinical presentation it is reasonable to propose that patients who have had cardiac involvement initially should be seen every 13 months periodic evaluation in addition to detailed history taking and physical examination should include a 12-lead ecg and 2ddoppler echocardiography125 or preferably cardiac mri with late gadolinium enhancement appropriate heart failure therapy should be initiated and maintained when required and plans put in place to optimize doses patients should be given standard advice regarding physical activity as regards unknown long-term consequences of covid-19 regular cv risk assessment should be considered in all patients who survive covid-19 covid-19 brings unprecedented ethical problems and situations facing the medical profession around the world in the light of the huge imbalance between therapeutic needs and resource availability of an unprecedented scale in our generation the italian society of anesthesiology and intensive care siaarti126 along with other national societies provided an ethical statement aimed to guarantee the correct psychological framework to physicians massively exposed to the need to apply hard triage rules while facing huge ethical dilemmas126 these are derived from the fact that the need for intensive care must be integrated with other elements of clinical suitability thus including the type and severity of the disease the presence of comorbidities the impairment of other organs and systems and their reversibility126 clinicians are not either deontologically or by training accustomed to reasoning with criteria of maxi-emergency triage as in the current exceptional situation126 in preparation for the covid-19 pandemic many healthcare providers have had to scale down outpatient services and also defer elective cardiac procedures and surgeries this in some instances has led to the positive integration of technology and development of virtual clinics127 however uptake of virtual clinics has not been universal and has also been compromised by re-deployment of the workforce to help manage the pandemic the long-term clinical impact of scaling down outpatient activity reduced access to diagnostics and deferral of routine procedures is likely to be significant and extend beyond the pandemic similarly the perceived risk of being exposed to covid-19 has led to a decline or a delay in presentation of acute cardiac emergencies which is likely to contribute to cardiac mortality and morbidity covid-19 implications are wider than the effects of the disease on individual patients practically all countries affected by the disease developed mitigation and containment strategies based on social distancing cv consequences of social distancing may be profound both experimental and clinical research has shown the effects of social isolation and loneliness on cognition and memory128132 metabolic disorders133136 cancer137139 and immune disorders139141 in the context of cvds the absence of positive relationships and the reduced chance of interaction with other people social distancing have been identified as major risk factors for cv mortality142151 a recent meta-analysis including a total of 181 006 participants152 demonstrated that the risk for ischaemic heart disease and stroke increased by 29 and 32 respectively in lonely and socially isolated people similar results were reported from a uk biobank analysis153 the mechanisms of detrimental effects of social isolation are multiple and are related to the activation of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenocortical hpa axis154157 changes in the sympathetic vascular tone148158159 elevated levels of cortisol156160161 and a reduced responsivity of the glucocorticoid receptor162165 the social distancing strategies used in covid-19 should consider these effects and aim to mitigate them using available technological advances in this comprehensive review we aimed to highlight the current state of the art information regarding covid-19 and cvd table 7 our understanding of cv risk and consequences of covid-19 is developing continuously however there are many knowledge gaps and there are many unanswered questions below we point out a few burning unknowns at the moment
 what are the factors genetic or otherwise that influence interindividual variability in susceptibility to covid-19 its severity or clinical outcomes the mechanisms through which cvds worsen the prognosis in covid-19 are unknown it remains to be addressed to what extent individual cvds are exacerbated by covid-19 do pre-existing hypertension and cvds increase infection risk andor worsen the course of disease progression is the severity of cvds related to high expression levels of ace2 the sars-cov-2 receptor in the heart and blood vessels what influence if any do inhibitors of the raas have on susceptibility to covid-19 and its clinical outcomes what are the factors or therapies for cvds that may confer protective effects against covid-19 and its clinical outcomes how does pre-existing cvd worsen cardiac involvement specifically what transferable knowledge can be learned about this pathogen that would advance our understanding of cv risk for sars-cov-2 influenza and other virus infections in the future finally probably the most important question remains what are the determinants of heterogeneous host responses to sars-cov-2 infection the answers will be found in integrated approaches by cv immunological id and other expertise coming together the use of systems based on hypothesis-free in silico methodologies will be essential this pandemic is unlike any other in arriving at the same time as humankind being in possession of remarkable molecular data science and informatic tools this is a major test of our ability to harness such capacity for the greater good these questions need to be answered with the highest quality science and clinical research since the current pandemic of coronavirus might not be the last  is aberrant cd8 t cell activation by hypertension associated with cardiac injury in severe cases of covid-19 chao zhang fu-sheng wang jean-sbastien silvestre fernando arenzana-seisdedos hong tang   covid-19 global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 sars-cov-21 has swept 185 countries and regions with more than 2824728 confirmed cases and 197667 death as on april 25 2020 according the coronavirus resource center at johns hopkins university accumulating data suggest that hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are the most frequent comorbidities in covid-19 patients and case mortality rates tended to be high in these individuals2 among few studies that focus on covid-19 severe pneumonia cardiovascular diseases are among the most frequent comorbidities35 with hypertension being the most common 58 of 191 patients 30 in one study exceeding twofold in covid-19 ards patients 23 of 84 274 more than mild patients 16 of 117 137 in another study angiotensin ii ang ii is a potent hypertensive hormone and increased ang ii is associated with hypertension and heart failure6 lung7 and renal dysfunction8 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 converts ang ii to ang 17 to negatively regulate the reninangiotensin system ras and reninangiotensinaldosterone system9 sars-cov-2 binds to the catalytic domain of ace2 with higher binding affinity than sars-cov for cell entry1012 notably sars-cov spike protein engagement can downregulate ace2 expression and activate ras for lung injury13 furthermore plasma level of ang ii is markedly elevated and correlated to viral load and lung injury of covid-19 patients14 therefore reduction of cell surface ace2 due to sars-cov-2 endocytosis would augment ang ii pathological processes in the development of hypertension cardiomyopathy and nephropathy15 in severe covid-19 patients hypertension is treated with ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii type-i receptor blockers arbs resulting in ace2 upregulation it is unclear whether arbace regime is warranted in covid-19 due to insufficient evidence at the moment european society of cardiology recommends not to change ras blockade in covid-19 patients who are on it unless adverse clinical indications occur further study needs to better understand the impaired ras in the viral pathogenesis of covid-19 ace2 is highly expressed in the heart tissue implicating a possibly direct viral infection of the myocardium strikingly two independent postmortem examinations revealed no evidence of viral infection or replication in cardiac tissues albeit pronounced cardiac inflammation exists1617 it is unlikely that viral infection and replication directly cause or aggravate cardiac injury in these severe patients it is becoming recognized that macrophages and t cells infiltrate to the heart in response to hypertension and the end-organ damage are in part mediated by activation of these infiltrated cells18 our lab showed that mice lacking cd8 t cells are efficiently protected from hypertension-induced cardiac damage cd8 t cells thus can sense the hypertension independent of t cell receptor19 more importantly cd8 t cells are required for macrophage infiltration in myocardium and subsequent activation by cd8 t cells secreted ifn- how do cd8 t cells respond to hypertension one study suggests that mineralocorticoid receptor on cd8 t cells directly sense blood pressure and promote inflammatory milieu through secreting ifn-2021 furthermore hypertension can trigger oxidative modification of proteins in dc cells by highly reactive -ketoaldehydes isoketals which activate dc to produce il-6 il-1 and il-23 activated dcs promote t cell particularly cd8 t cell proliferation and production of ifn- and il-17a22 intriguingly a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis which associates with a massive cd8 t cell and macrophage activation but decreased nk cell activity has been noted for covid-19 patients in european icus taken together these results suggest that cd8 t cells may function as a key hypertension effector that drives macrophage-mediated cardiac damage severe covid-19 patients also showed increased il-6 il-1 and ifn-23 it is worthy of studying whether blockade of il-6 or il-1 which is currently under clinical trials would reduce cardiac injury through inhibition of cd8 t cell-macrophage infiltration and overactivation the glucocorticoid treatment of icu patients shall also be closely monitored for potential beneficial or detrimental effect on cd8 t cell activation lastly ccr5 is a major chemoattracting receptor in cd8 t cells that involves in various pathogenic conditions including viral infections24 the antiviral drugs such as selzentry maraviroc and leronlimab pro 140 have been successfully used for treatment of aids25 it is therefore of great interest to study whether these drugs can block cardiac infiltration of cd8 t cells thereby reduce hypertensive cardiac injury of covid-19 patients  covid-19 hypertension and cardiovascular diseases should we change the therapy the coronavirus disease covid-19 has spread all around the world in a very short period of time recent data are showing significant prevalence of arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases cvd among patients with covid-19 which raised many questions about higher susceptibility of patients with these comorbidities to the novel coronavirus as well as the role of hypertension and cvd in progression and the prognosis of covid-19 patients there is a very limited amount of data usually obtained from a small population regarding the effect of the underlying disease on the outcome in patients with covid-19 the evaluation of the treatment of these comorbidities at baseline and during covid-19 is scarce and the results are conflicting hypertension and cvd after the adjustment for other clinical and demographic parameters primarily age did not remain independent predictors of the lethal outcome in covid-19 patients some investigations speculated about the association between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas and susceptibility to covid-19 as well as the relationship between raas inhibitors and the adverse outcome in these patients withdrawing or switching raas inhibitors would have uncertain benefits but it would definitely have many disadvantages such as uncontrolled hypertension cardiac function deterioration and renal function impairment which could potentially induce more complications in patients with covid-19 than the infection of coronavirus itself the aim of this review article was to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and cvd in patients with covid-19 their influence on the outcome and the effect of treatment of hypertension and cvd in covid-19 patients tadic marijana  cuspidi cesare  mancia giuseppe  dell039  oro raffaella  grassi guido potential mechanisms of hemorrhagic stroke in elderly covid-19 patients haili wang xiaojia tang hongyang fan yuhan luo yuxia song yao xu yingzhu chen   zhou et al provided the first evidence that covid-19 is associated with a novel coronavirus strain 12 they used next-generation sequencing and pan-cov polymerase chain reaction pcr primers to determine the cause of the disease in 7 patients with covid-19 in hubei most of whom were seafood market sellers or deliverers 12 their findings significantly strengthened the etiological association reported by investigators from india 13 switzerland 14 and other places in china 15 who had also isolated the novel coronavirus from patients with covid-19 these efforts corroborated by statements from chinese authorities conclusively led to identification of sars-cov-2 as the causative agent of the covid-19 outbreak 14 since its discovery the sequence of the complete genome of sars-cov-2 has been determined 13 16 17 it has 29000 nucleotides in length and like other covs it contains at least six open reading frames orfs and several accessory genes 13 according to chen et al 15 the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 is 89 identical to the bat sars-like-covzxc21 and 82 identical to the human sars-cov 15 in addition phylogenetic analysis indicated that two bat sars-like covs were the nearest homologs of sars-cov-2 13 based on genomic structure and phylogenetic analysis the subfamily coronavirinae are divided into four genera namely alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus 13 18 19 currently seven human covs have been reported 229e hcov-229e oc43 hcov-oc43 nl63 hcov-nl63 hku1 hcov-hku1 sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 belong to the alphacoronavirus genus while hcov-hku1 sars-cov mers-cov and hcov-oc43 are betacoronavirus members 18 sars-cov-2 is also classified as a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the subgenus sarbecovirus of the coronaviridae family 13 15 the 3 terminal one-third of sars-cov-2 genome sequence encodes four structural proteins namely spike protein s envelope protein e membrane protein m and nucleocapsid protein n among these the s gene is particularly important for receptor binding and host specificity 13 infection by cov begins with the binding of the s protein a surface antigen determining viral tropism to cell-surface molecules expressed in host cells 20 as shown in table 1 host receptors for the seven human covs include human aminopeptidase n cd13 for hcov-229e 21 9-o-acetylated sialic acid for hcov-oc43 22 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 for sars-cov 22 ace2 for hcov-nl63 23 24 9-o-acetylated sialic acid for hcov-hku1 25 26 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 for mers-cov 27 and ace2 by sars-cov-2 18 at presentation the most common symptoms in covid-19 patients are fever dry cough and shortness of breath whereas headache diarrhea and vomiting are more rare 3 2830 however early neurological symptoms eg headache epilepsy and unconsciousness without obvious respiratory symptoms have been reported for numerous covid-19 patients 10 31 a 2005 case report by xu et al provided the first direct evidence that sars-cov has the ability to infect the central nervous system cns 32 a predicted cdna fragment specific for sars-cov was amplified by nested rt-pcr from vero-e6 cell cultures inoculated with a brain tissue extract from a symptomatic patient and presence of enveloped virus particles 8090 nm in diameter was found by transmission electronic microscopy 32 shortly before this finding another study had reported the case of a 32-year-old woman with sars whose cerebrospinal fluid tested positive for sars-cov 33 these findings were further supported by experiments in mice that demonstrated the ability of various covs to cause cns infections 3436 indeed sars-cov-2 shares similar characteristics with sars-cov and both anecdotal and statistical data indicate that neurologic symptoms are not common in covid-19 patients 10 since it is well known that cerebral hemorrhage may result from viral infection of the cns compromising the neurovascular unit 3740 available evidence strongly suggest that sars-cov-2 infection may greatly increase the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke especially in at-risk patients hypertension is the most important risk factor for cerebral hemorrhage 41 42 of note for the 138 covid-19 confirmed cases analyzed by wang et al 30 43 patients 312 were hypertensive a proportion that reflects relative to other diseases the higher susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection conferred by hypertension similar results were recently reported by both guan et al 26 and the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team 50 sars-cov-2 infection in humans is mediated by binding of the receptor-binding domain rbd of the viral s glycoprotein to ace2 receptors in host cells and this in turn may lead to downregulation of ace2 expression 20 43 since reduced ace2 expression implies increased ang ii availability covid-19 patients with pre-existing hypertension may experience large blood pressure bp fluctuations making them especially susceptible to hemorrhagic stroke episodes there is a close relationship between systolic bp variability sbpv and poor prognosis of cerebral hemorrhage divani et al reported that elevated sbpv in the first 24 h of admission was related to unfavorable in-hospital prognosis in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage ich 44 since bp elevations resulting from downregulation of ace2 expression may occur after sars-cov-2 infection higher sbpv may be present on admission in hemorrhagic stroke patients affected by covid-19 therefore the management of bp might require additional attention during the hyper-acute and acute hemorrhagic stroke phases in covid-19 patients as both high absolute bp levels and high bp fluctuations are main determinants of cerebral hemorrhage prognosis diabetes is also an independent risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke 42 huang et al reported that among 41 patients with laboratory- confirmed sars-cov-2 infection 8 20 cases had diabetes this again represents a higher proportion of comorbidity cases compared with other diseases 45 indeed available data suggest that among covid-19-confirmed cases with underlying chronic diseases diabetes ranks second after hypertension 29 45 elevated plasma d-dimer levels were associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke 41 recently chen et al conducted a retrospective single-center study including 99 patients with covid-19 and found elevated d-dimer levels in 36 patients 36 28 however mortality rate for this subgroup was not reported meanwhile in a similar study assessing 191 covid-19-confirmed patients d-dimer greater than 1 mgl on admission was associated with significantly increased odds p  00033 of in-hospital death 46 of note a recently posted pre-print article reporting on 248 consecutive covid-19 cases in wuhan found d-dimer elevation  050 mgl in 746 185248 of the patients d-dimer levels correlated with disease severity and values 214 mgl predicted in-hospital mortality with a sensitivity of 882 and specificity of 713 47 surprisingly two recent studies have reported an association between sars-cov-2 infection and the incidence of stroke 31 48 a single center retrospective observational study by li et al reported a 5 risk of ischemic stroke and a 05 risk of cerebral hemorrhage in 221 patients with sars-cov-2 infection from wuhan china 48 in this cohort patients with new onset stroke are obviously older more likely to present with severe covid-19 and have the above risk factors including hypertension diabetes and elevated plasma d-dimer levels 48 another study of 214 patients reported 5 57 developed acute cerebrovascular diseases including 4 46 patients with ischemic stroke and 1 11 with cerebral hemorrhage in severe patients with covid-19 31 nevertheless further studies including larger sample sizes more exhaustive assessment of patients clinical histories and additional molecular analysis are clearly needed to determine in which cases stroke is directly triggered by sars-cov-2 infection or it occurs coincidentally 49 inflammatory monocyte-macrophages imms and neutrophils are major sources of cytokines and chemokines involved in the pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 50 some of these factors represent classical inflammatory biomarkers associated with secondary brain injury following cerebral hemorrhage and may have prognostic value in hemorrhagic stroke patients 5155 lattanzi et al recently reviewed available evidence pointing to the relevance of assessing the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio nlr to determine inflammatory status in ich patients 54 in turn newer studies confirmed nlrs predictive value for prognosis of ich 56 57 neutrophil-derived matrix metalloproteinases mmps are upregulated after acute ich contributing significantly to tissue destruction and activation of neuro-inflammatory cascades 54 accordingly research suggests that it may be possible to mitigate brain damage by early short-term inhibition of mmps 53 napoli et al reported that increased concentrations of serum c-reactive protein crp a marker of inflammation may be an independent predictor of ich outcome 52 nevertheless it should be considered that interethnic genomic differences may influence crp status and its predictive values on different stroke phenotypes another marker namely serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ngal a member of the lipocalin family of proteins associated with transport of small hydrophobic molecules plays an important role in the innate immune response and has also been identified as an independent predictor for outcome following hemorrhagic stroke 51 given that these inflammatory biomarkers have been associated with both sars-cov-2-related cytopathic effects and hemorrhagic stroke outcome it would be worthwhile to explore which changes in inflammatory biomarkers occur after hemorrhagic stroke and their predictive value in patients with and without covid-19 this would allow to better define reliable indices of hemorrhagic stroke severity and functional recovery substantially reduced peripheral lymphocyte counts were evident in severe covid-19 cases 2830 45 58 xu et al reported pathological findings of lung liver and heart biopsies as well as blood cell analysis from a patient who died of covid-19 59 the findings showed infiltration of imms in the lung whereas peripheral cd4 and cd8 t cells were reduced in number but overactivated the authors suggested that severe immune injury in this patient was due to overactivation of t cells manifested by increased representation of highly pro-inflammatory ccr6 th17 cd4 t cell subsets and enhanced cytotoxic capacity of cd8 t cells these data suggest that although lymphopenia is a common feature in patients with covid-19 it may be paralleled by a pro-inflammatory phenotypic switching in t cell subsets that could be critically associated with disease severity and mortality 9 59 in addition it was suggested that like sars-cov sars-cov-2 also acts on lymphocytes in the respiratory mucosa leading to a systemic cytokine storm concomitant with reduced peripheral blood lymphocytes which impairs cellular immune function 28 this effect will be clearly potentiated by immune senescence a well-described phenomenon in many middle-aged and elderly people 60 and aggravated by underlying conditions such as hypertension diabetes and cerebrovascular disease this evidence points to worsened outcomes for patients with covid-19 and cerebral hemorrhage comorbidity soon after the covid-19 outbreak investigations confirmed that the ace2 receptor abundantly expressed in lung alveolar epithelial cells enables sars-cov-2 entry into host cells through the rbd of the virus s glycoprotein 12 61 62 the rbd that confers ace2 binding specificity is part of the s1 subunit of the large ectodomain of the s protein the ectodomain contains also an s2 subunit which mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes 61 a ternary structure of the rbd of sars-cov-2 was obtained by molecular simulation revealing that the structure is essentially superimposable 72 identity to that of sars-cov except for a flexible loop with cngvegfnc that replaces the rigid loop with ctppalnc present in sars-cov 61 further analysis indicated that the unique f486 residue in the flexible loop can penetrate deep into a hydrophobic pocket in ace2 formed by f28 l79 y83 and l97 61 ace2 was identified in 2000 as a homolog of the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace although with different substrate specificity 63 ace2 primarily acts on angiotensin ii ang-ii a major bioactive peptide 43 to generate the vasodilatory heptapeptide ang-1-7 while ace acts on angiotensin i ang-i to generate ang-ii 43 ace2 counterbalances the vasopressor effect of the aceang-iiat1 axis by stimulating vasodilation through the ace2ang-1-7masr axis 64 65 demonstrating the adversarial relationship between ace and ace2 crackower et al reported that heart function is impaired in ace2-deficient mice and this effect can be rescued by ablation of ace expression 66 ace2 expression is widely distributed across different cells and tissues to date it was identified in epithelial cells of the oral mucosa 62 pulmonary alveolar type ii cells 6769 esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon 69 cholangiocytes 70 myocardial cells kidney proximal tubule cells and bladder urothelial cells 46 in addition ace2 expression has also been detected in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells 71 and in some neurons 43 64 7173 including those in the cardio-respiratory center of the brainstem 43 the widespread expression of ace2 is thus consistent with the reported effects of sars-cov-2 on multiple tissues and organs binding of sars-cov-2 to ace2 receptors in brain blood vessels may trigger the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin-6 il-6 and tumor necrosis factor tnf leading to activation and extravasation of lymphocyte subsets neutrophils and macrophages with subsequent neurological manifestations 74 on the other hand neuronal ace2 expression could also be a significant factor in covid-19 cases associated with cerebral hemorrhage research on the 2003 sars outbreak concluded that downregulation of ace2 expression occurred in infected organs including lungs 75 kidney 43 heart 76 liver 43 and brain 43 similarly a study by chen et al reported decreased ace2 expression in the lungs of covid-19 patients 61 downregulation of ace2 expression may increase risk of hemorrhagic stroke in several ways i ace2 deficiency in the brain may impair endothelial function in cerebral arteries leading to a 4-fold elevation in the risk of cerebrovascular events including hemorrhagic stroke 77 ii downregulation of ace2 expression may increase local ang-ii levels which acting on at1 receptors may rise bp and facilitate hypertrophy and fibrosis 64 iii decreased ace2 expression would also lead to reduced generation of ang 1-7 and depression of ang 1-7masr signaling thus preventing its vasodilatory growth inhibiting and antifibrotic actions 64 78 figure 1 it calls for special attention the fact that covid-19 may exacerbate any underlying hypertension and put patients at higher risk for hemorrhagic stroke several mechanisms may contribute to hemorrhagic stroke in hypertensive patients infected with sars-cov-2 these include fibrinoid necrosis promoted by increased vascular pressure 79 and extensive structural and functional alterations in endothelium and smooth muscle in intracerebral arteries often aggravated by atherosclerosis especially in the elderly 80 the bbb is a semi-permeable structure consisting of a well-defined basement membrane and endothelial cells bound by tight junctions that limit the passage of macromolecules into the brain parenchyma the bbb lies in close apposition to brain cell types including pericytes astrocytes microglia and neurons and is especially susceptible to damage by both hypertension and diabetes 81 82 xu et al reported that a chemokine ie the monokinemigcxcl9 induced by ifn-g mostly in glial cells might be involved in the brain immunopathology triggered by sars 32 elevated mig levels in the blood are correlated with brain infiltration of cd68 monocytesmacrophages and cd3 t lymphocytes in the brain 32 given the similarities between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov this mechanism deserves further exploration as it may lead to therapeutic strategies to prevent or attenuate brain pathology in covid-19 patients the bbb is a dynamic and complex structure that helps maintain brain homeostasis and compensates fluctuations in the systemic circulation 83 expression of ace2 in endothelial cells of the bbb may be a gateway for sars-cov-2 entry into the brain 83 moreover the ensuing ace2 down-regulation compounded by age-related ace2 deficiency in older patients might further increase endothelial dysfunction and risk of ich 77 more studies are needed to ascertain the impact of ace2 expression at the bbb and its effect on sars-cov-2-mediated cns symptoms particularly ich there is accruing evidence that viral cns infections may cause hemorrhage stroke 37 39 84 the pathogenesis may involve cytokine chemokine and protease actions increasing bbb permeability and damage andor demise of the neurovascular unit during the necrotizing process 37 although the specific mechanisms remain unclear it is obvious that the type and extent of the immune response triggered by the sars-cov-2 determine symptoms severity a recent study from anderson et al revealed that bats the most likely source of the novel sars-cov-2 have evolved a highly specific innate immune response characterized by a large expansion of the type i interferon gene family 85 while this may clarify the basis of bats immune resistance to sars-cov-2 there are still many open questions about the mechanisms mediating immune defense against cov-2 in humans in this regard it will be very valuable to ascertain and compare immunological ie t cell status cytokine expression and genetic ie hla haplotypes profiles between symptomatic and asymptomatic covid-19 patients which have shown to influence responses to recent viral outbreaks 86 this should allow predicting why high viral replication early in the course of infection would lead to the cytokine storm characteristic of severe covid-19 cases 50 the current covid-19 outbreak has undoubtedly increased anxiety fear and stress in many people around the world social stress anxiety and depression are potential risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke therefore adequate management of these conditions is a key aspect in primary prevention of cerebrovascular disease 87 88 the locus coeruleus a structure in the brainstem consists mainly of adrenergic neurons that play a crucial role in the genesis of anxiety by releasing catecholamines that critically influence the stress response 89 indeed research has shown that excessive adrenergic stimulation by catecholamines could lead to severe vasospasm and microcirculation disturbances thus increasing the risk of hemorrhagic stroke 90 although people of all ages can be infected middle-aged and elderly people are most severely affected by covid-19 suggesting that aging is a prominent risk factor accordingly it seems logical that the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in covid-19 patients would increase significantly with age although a recent article by oxley et al reported covid-19-related stroke episodes occurred in five young patients 91 based on available evidence camacho et al concluded that age is a strong risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke the deadliest stroke type 92 their study highlights several age-related processes and pathologies including cerebral microembolism white matter lesions vascular basement membrane thickening and increased bbb permeability which determine endothelial damage changes in vessel elasticity and ensuing fluctuations in blood flow and pressure that cause loss of autoregulation and increase the risk of ich 92 research on both animal models and humans indicated that aging is closely associated with endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress in cerebral arteries 9397 moreover studies in rodents suggested that these deleterious effects can be promoted by alterations in the ras system in aged brains specifically works by pena-silva et al 77 and labandeira-garcia et al 98 suggested that age-related downregulation of ace2 and at2 expression may promote vascular dysfunction because the anti-inflammatoryanti-oxidant effects of angiiat2 and ang1-7masr signaling are overridden by pro-inflammatorypro-oxidant signaling through the angiiat1 axis although confirmatory data in humans is still needed these studies provide strong support for the overall concept that brain ras activity has a critical effect on cerebrovascular function during aging and may contribute to endothelial dysfunction oxidative stress and risk of hemorrhagic stroke covid-19 emerged as a new human infectious disease caused by sars-cov-2 a novel coronavirus a significant proportion of covid-19 cases especially older patients manifest neurological rather than respiratory symptoms on admission and may be at higher risk of developing cerebral hemorrhage the mechanisms by which covid-19 may promote hemorrhagic stroke in the elderly are not yet clear but may involve downregulation of ace2 expression secondary to sars-cov-2 binding to neurovascular ace2 receptors this might increase ang-ii expression and decrease ang 1-7 expression leading to severe bp elevation increased bbb permeability and extensive alterations in endothelium and smooth muscle function in intracerebral arteries the patients most gravelly affected by covid-19 have underlying hypertension disease which greatly increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke since sbpv in the first 24 h of admission predicts cerebral hemorrhage outcome special attention should be paid to management of bp in at-risk covid-19 patients predisposing factors may be compounded in covid-19 patients by the inability of their immune system to efficiently prevent or counteract the pernicious effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokines released upon infection in addition anxiety and stress may lead to enhancement of adrenergic tone and trigger vasospasm and microcirculation disturbances further contributing to cerebrovascular symptoms in light of this exploring the changes in inflammatory biomarkers occurring in covid-19 patients with cns symptoms suggestive of incipient stroke would aid diagnosis and treatment to avoid irreversible outcomes  municipality-level predictors of covid-19 mortality in mexico a cautionary tale alejandra contreras-manzano sd carlos guerrero-lpez msc m mercedes aguerrebere ana sedas cristina hctor lamadrid-figueroa   the first case of the new coronavirus disease 2019 in mexico was confirmed on february 28 th  2020 1  since then the government of mexico has launched a series of preventive measures which adhere to the world health organization who sars-cov-2 strategic preparedness and response plan aimed at limiting the spread of the virus 2  the national campaign for healthy distance implemented from march 23 rd to may 30 th 2020 included social distance hand washing general confinement self-isolation for those with covid-19 associated symptoms for 14 days and limited economic mobility 3 globally individual factors associated with covid-19 mortality have been found to be male sex age over 65 years ethnicity hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease among others 5 6  according to the 2018 national health and nutrition survey ensanut-2018 of mexico 361 of adults over the age of 19 were obese 391 overweight 137 diabetic and 25 hypertensive 7  considering that most states in mexico hold a heterogeneous distribution in the prevalence of such comorbidities regions with an increased burden of these diseases and sociodemographic related factors are at higher risk of encountering more severe manifestations of covid-19 which might require hospitalization or critical care as well as higher covid-19 mortality rates it is deemed that in order to curb the pandemic national decisions ought to be in coordination with those at a local level in the united states sociodemographic and health factors related to covid-19 vary importantly across counties 8 9 10  mexico has 2457 municipalities distributed in 32 states which are the basis of the territorial organization and the political and administrative division 11  by june 1 st  2020 the federal government gave the states of the country the responsibility for deciding the reopening of social educational and economic activities based on a traffic light system established by the moh 12  covid-19 is however expected to linger within communities for several months or even years to come targeted public policy interventions in regions that are highly vulnerable to covid-19 are crucial to safeguard protect and strengthen communities facing the pandemic therefore the objective of this study was to analyze the municipality-level factors associated with a higher mortality rate mr of covid-19 in mexico and to pinpoint locations expected to suffer from a high covid-19 mortality coronavirus pandemic surveillance in mexico has been carried out using the sentinel model proposed by the pan american health organization paho 13  this model works with 475 nationally representative health facilities that monitor coronavirus cases through the test for sars-cov-2 conducted in ten percent of suspected cases and 100 those suspected with severe acute respiratory syndrome and signs of breathing difficulty or in deaths of those hospitalized suspected to be covid-19 cases the operational definition of a suspected case in mexico is of an individual who in the last 7 days presented at least 2 of the following signs and symptoms cough fever or headache accompanied by at least one of the following signs or symptoms dyspnea arthralgia myalgia odynophagiapharyngeal burning rhinorrhea conjunctivitis andor chest pain 14  a confirmed case of covid-19 is defined as a person with a diagnosis given by the national network of public health laboratories recognized by the institute of epidemiological diagnosis and reference indre who met the criteria of a suspected case 15  we used the daily updated open data source from the general directorate of epidemiology of mexican moh which includes demographic and health information of confirmed negative and suspect cases of covid-19 4 we extracted the data as of june 20 th  2020 of the number of confirmed symptomatic cases and deaths at the municipality-level level we obtained data on variables that we hypothesized could be linked to differential testing practices or exposure to sars-cov-2 of the most recent and complete information from census and records from  to identify the municipality-level factors associated with the mortality rate of covid-19 we adjusted a negative binomial regression model in which the dependent variable was the sum of confirmed covid-19 deaths in symptomatic cases n18 886 by municipality of residence and the independent variables were the quintiles of the distribution of sociodemographic and health outcomes within the municipality expected mortality rates emr for each municipality incidence rate ratios irr and 95 confidence intervals were estimated to better understand the association between mr of covid-19 and municipalitylevel factors and in addition to the main objective of the study we also fitted  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted

table 2  in concordance with the municipality-level results diabetes belonging to an indigenous ethnic group and obesity were associated with higher risk of mortality due to coronavirus other individual risk factors of lethality-case were age 40 or over male sex hypertension ckd copd and immunosuppression in addition having received medical care in private health institutions was associated with a lower lethality of covid-19 compared to those cared for at public health services as for individuals who sought medical attention between 6 and 14 days after the onset of symptoms they had a higher risk of dying compared to those who received medical care between 0 and 5 days after the onset of symptoms in supplementary table 3  we illustrate the municipality-level factors

posted july 14 2020  municipality-level factors found to be associated with higher risk of mortality of covid-19 were the population density the prevalence of diabetes and obesity the mortality rate of diabetes the proportion of indigenous population of economically active population and the rate of economic units that operate essential activities during the covid-19 outbreak first high proportion of population economically active may reflect lower confinement and increased mobility while higher population density is may be related to less social distancing and high connectivity secondly high mortality rate of diabetes means inadequate control of glucose levels -which has a negative impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems both crucial in the bodys response to covid-19 25 -and also lower access and quality of medical care or weaker local health care systems 26  despite of at the individual level the hypertension was associated with higher lethality of covid-19 at the municipality level the mortality rate of hypertension was not associated with high mortality of covid-19 and within states with the highest prevalence of hypertension they had lower mortality risk of covid-19 this result could be explained by the fact that the prevalence used in our model came from adults already diagnosed with hypertension which according to previous surveys represented approximately 60 of the total cases of hypertensive population and are those with access to health care services and antihypertensive medication 27  nevertheless unknown and unobserved variables prior to the demand of healthcare services might be reflecting an inverse association between hypertension and covid-19 mortality  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the

medrxiv preprint it is important to note that the cumulative incidence of cases in indigenous populations was low however the risk of mortality from coronavirus was higher than in municipalities with lower proportion of indigenous population these findings could indicate a lower access to healthcare services and testing combined with a dynamic where the epidemic migrates further into more marginalized areas with a higher proportion of indigenous population other countries have found that many mechanisms underlying the higher lethality of covid-19 in ethnic minorities are related to marginalization conditions such as locality of residence work conditions and health inequalities 28 29  marginalized conditions such as non-sewage service or dirt floors were inversely associated with mortality of covid-19 communities with these household characteristics are mostly remote and with low connectivity which could be protective from sars-cov-2 exposure notwithstanding marginalized and remote communities could also have lower access to both testing for sars-cov-2 and health care which could lead to underreporting of cases and deaths special screening strategies and tracing and isolation of contacts within these vulnerable communities are essential to favor the prevention of deaths from covid-19 30  in may 2020 the mexican moh published a list of 324 municipios de la esperanza hope municipalities which in the last 28 days prior to may 16 did not have any confirmed cases of covid-19 and were not adjacent to municipalities with confirmed cases this list was a guide for state governors to restart non-essential activities on may 18 2020 31  however according to our results 16 of these municipality-level are at high risk of having worse outcomes in the event of an outbreak and as of june 20 2020 389 symptomatic cases and 29 deaths due to covid-19 were confirmed in these municipalities the identification of municipalities with a high burden of risk factors of

will be crucial to prevent or control the onset of new outbreaks within these municipalities include testing isolation and contact tracing as well as more general measures according to the three-stage traffic light system that was established in mexico to reactivate the economy and reduce contingency measures 12  additional to the municipality-level factors associated with the cumulative incidence and mortality of covid-19 we identified that municipalities in condition of extreme poverty had higher case-fatality rate of covid-19 for example oaxaca chihuahua and guerrero are states in which some municipalities had case-fatality rates higher than 80 this finding suggests a low availability of tests in this communities as per the limitations within our study que precision of the estimations depends on the quality of the databases for example the aging of our data for some variables is up to 10 years which may not reflect heterogeneous changes within municipalities by 2020 nevertheless data from previous years still holds relation to the following years and they were useful to find expected associations for obesity diabetes and hypertension prevalence the information from the ensanut-2018 are representatively at state level reducing the variability within municipalities however for the rest of the variables such as mortality rates of diabetes and hypertension information

rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 which arose from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection has recently become a public health emergency of international concern 1 covid-19 has contributed to an enormous adverse impact globally hitherto there have been 109 577 laboratory-confirmed cases and 3809 deaths globally as of march 10th 2020 2 the clinical manifestations of covid-19 are according to the latest reports 312 heterogeneous on admission 2051 of patients reported as having at least one comorbidity with diabetes 1020 hypertension 1015 and other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases 740 being most common 3 4 6 previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of any comorbidity has been associated with a 34-fold increased risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with h7n9 infection 13 similar with influenza 1418 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 19 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 2028 covid-19 more readily predisposed to respiratory failure and death in susceptible patients 4 5 nonetheless previous studies have been certain limitations in study design including the relatively small sample sizes and single center observations studies that address these limitations is needed to explore for the factors underlying the adverse impact of covid-19 our objective was to evaluate the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with covid-19 by stratification according to the number and type of comorbidities thus unravelling the sub-populations with poorer prognosis this was a retrospective case study that collected data from patients with covid-19 throughout china under the coordination of the national health commission which mandated the reporting of clinical information from individual designated hospitals which admitted patients with covid-19 after careful medical chart review we compiled the clinical data of laboratory-confirmed hospitalised cases from 575 hospitals representing 317 of the certified hospitals for admitting patients with covid-19 between december 11th 2019 and january 31st 2020 the diagnosis of covid-19 was made based on the world health organization interim guidance 29 because of the urgency of data extraction complete random sampling could not be applied in our settings all clinical profiles outside hubei province were centrally provided by the national health commission three respiratory experts from guangzhou were dispatched to wuhan for raw data extraction from wuhan jinyintan hospital where most cases in wuhan were located our cohort included 132 patients from wuhan jinyintan hospital and one each from 338 hospitals our cohort represented the overall situation as of jan 31st taking into account the proportion of hospitals  one fourth and patient number 135 159011 791 cases as well as the broad coverage covering all major provincescitiesautonomous regions confirmed cases denoted the patients whose high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay findings for nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were positive 3 see online supplement for further details the interval between the potential earliest date of transmission source wildlife suspected or confirmed cases contacts and the potential earliest date of symptom onset ie cough fever fatigue myalgia was adopted to calculate the incubation period in light that the latest date was recorded in some patients who had continuous exposure to contamination sources the incubation periods of less than 10 day would not be included in our analysis the incubation periods were summarised based on the patients who had delineated the specific date of exposure the clinical data including recent exposure history clinical symptoms and signs comorbidities and laboratory findings upon admission were reviewed and extracted by experienced respiratory clinicians who subsequently entered the data into a computerised database for further double-check of all cases manifestations on chest x-ray or computed tomography ct was summarised by integrating the documentation or description in medical charts and if available a further review by our medical staff major disagreement of the radiologic manifestations between the two reviewers was resolved by consultation with another independent reviewer because the disease severity reportedly predicted poorer clinical outcomes of avian influenza 13 patients were classified as having severe or non-severe covid-19 based on the 2007 american thoracic society infectious disease society of america guidelines 30 taking into account its global acceptance for severity stratification of community-acquired pneumonia although no validation was conducted in patients with viral pneumonia the predictive ability of the need for icu admission and mortality has been validated previously 31 32 briefly severe cases denoted at least one major criterion septic shock requiring vasoactive medications or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or at least three minor criteria respiratory rate being 30 times per minute or greater oxygen index being 250 or lower multiple lobe infiltration delirium or loss of consciousness blood urea nitrogen level being 20 mgdl1 or greater blood leukocyte count being 4000 per deciliter or lower blood platelet count being 100 000 per deciliter or lower body temperature being lower than 36 degrees hypotension necessitating vasoactive drugs for maintaining blood pressure comorbidities were determined based on patients self-report on admission comorbidities were initially treated as a categorical variable yes versus no and subsequently classified based on the number single versus multiple furthermore comorbidities were sorted according to the organ systems ie respiratory cardiovascular endocrine comorbidities that were classified into the same organ system ie coronary heart disease hypertension would be merged into a single category the primary endpoint of our study was a composite measure which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit icu or invasive ventilation or death this composite measure was adopted because all individual components were serious outcomes of h7n9 infections 13 the secondary endpoint was the mortality rate statistical analyses were conducted with spss software version 230 chicago il usa no formal sample size estimation was made because there has not been any published nationwide data on covid-19 nonetheless our sample size was deemed sufficient to power the statistical analysis given its representativeness of the national patient population continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges iqr as appropriate and the categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages in light that no random sampling was conducted all statistical analyses were descriptive and no p values would be presented for the statistical comparisons except for the cox proportional hazards regression model cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with the composite endpoints with the hazards ratio hr and 95 confidence interval 95ci being reported our findings indicated that the statistical assumption of proportional hazards analysis was not violated moreover cox regression model was considered more appropriate than logistic regression model because it has taken into account the potential impact of the various duration of follow-up from individual patients the age and smoking status were adjusted for in the proportional hazards regression model because they have been recognised as the risk factors of comorbidities even in the general population the smoking status was stratified as current smokers ex-smokers and never smokers in the regression models the national health commission has issued 11 791 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 in china as of january 31st 2020 at this time point for data cut-off our database has included 1590 cases from 575

 our study is the first nationwide investigation that systematically evaluates the impact of comorbidities on the clinical characteristics and prognosis in patients with covid-19 in china circulatory and endocrine comorbidities were common among patients with covid-19 patients with at least one comorbidity or more even so were associated with poor clinical outcomes these findings have provided further objective evidence with a large sample size and extensive coverage of the geographic regions across china to take into account baseline comorbid diseases in the comprehensive risk assessment of prognosis among patients with covid-19 on hospital admission overall our findings have echoed the recently published studies in terms of the commonness of comorbidities in patients with covid-19 37 despite considerable variations in the proportion in individual studies due to the limited sample size and the region where patients were managed circulatory diseases including hypertension and coronary heart diseases remained the most common category of comorbidity 37 apart from circulatory diseases endocrine diseases such as diabetes were also common in patients with covid-19 notwithstanding the commonness of circulatory and endocrine comorbidities patients with covid-19 rarely reported as having comorbid respiratory diseases particularly copd the reasons underlying this observation have been scant but could have arisen from the lack of awareness and the lack of spirometric testing in community settings that collectively contributed to the under-diagnosis of respiratory diseases 33 it should be stressed that the observed frequency of comorbidity may also reflect the transmission dynamics within particular age groups case detection or testing practices or hospital admission policies during the early phases of the epidemic consistent with recent reports 37 the percentage of patients with comorbid renal disease and malignancy was relatively low our findings have therefore added to the existing literature the spectrum of comorbidities in patients with covid-19 based on the larger sample sizes and representativeness of the whole patient population in china a number of existing literature reports have documented the escalated risks of poorer clinical outcomes in patients with avian influenza 1418 sars-cov 19 and mers-cov infections 2028 the most common comorbidities associated with poorer prognosis included diabetes 25 29 hypertension 28 respiratory diseases 19 28 cardiac diseases 19 28 pregnancy 16 renal diseases 28 and malignancy 19 our findings suggested that similar with other severe acute respiratory outbreaks comorbidities such as copd diabetes hypertension and malignancy predisposed to adverse clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19 the strength of association between different comorbidities and the prognosis however was less consistent when compared with the literature reports 16 19 25 28 for instance the risk between cardiac diseases and poor clinical outcomes of influenza sars-cov or mers-cov infections was inconclusive 16 19 25 28 except for diabetes no other comorbidities were identified to be the predictors of poor clinical outcomes in patients with mers-cov infections 25 few studies however have explored the mechanisms underlying these associations kulscar et al showed that mers-cov infections resulted in prolonged airway inflammation immune cell dysfunction and an altered expression profile of inflammatory mediators in diabetic mice models 27 a network-based analysis indicated that sars-cov infections led to immune dysregulation that could help explain the escalated risk of cardiac diseases bone diseases and malignancy 34 therefore immune dysregulation and prolonged inflammation might be the key drivers of the poor clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19 but await verification in more mechanistic studies it has been well accepted that some comorbidities frequently co-exist for instance diabetes 35 and copd 36 frequently co-exist with hypertension or coronary heart diseases therefore patients with co-existing comorbidities are more likely to have poorer baseline well-being importantly we have verified the significantly escalated risk of poor prognosis in patients with two or more comorbidities as compared with those who had no or only a single comorbidity our findings implied that both the category and number of comorbidities should be taken into account when predicting the prognosis in patients with covid-19 our findings suggested that patients with comorbidities had greater disease severity compared with those without furthermore a greater number of comorbidities correlated with greater disease severity of covid-19 the proper triage of patients should be implemented by carefully inquiring the medical history because this will help identify patients who would be more likely to develop serious adverse outcomes of covid-19 moreover better protection should be given to the patients with coivd-19 who had comorbidities upon confirmation of the diagnosis a main limitation was the self-report of comorbidities on admission under-reporting of comorbidities which could have stemmed from the lack of awareness andor the lack of diagnostic testing might contribute to the underestimation of the true strength of association with the clinical prognosis under-reporting of comorbidities could also lead to over-estimation of strength of association with adverse outcome however significant under-reporting was unlikely because the spectrum of our report was largely consistent with existing literature 37 and all patients were subject to a thorough history taking after hospital admission the relatively low age might help explain the low prevalence of copd in our cohort moreover the duration of follow-up was relatively short and some patients remained in the hospital as of the time of writing more studies that explore the associations in a sufficiently long time frame are warranted caution should be exercised when extrapolating our findings to other countries where there are outbreaks of covid-19 since the prevalence of comorbidities may differ among different countries therefore future studies that include an external validation of the results would be desirable although the temperature and systolic blood pressure differed between some subgroups they were unlikely to be clinically relevant finally because of the rapid evolving outbreak globally ongoing studies with the inclusion of more patients would be needed to increase the statistical power and lend support to subgroup analyses stratified by the specific comorbidities ie copd and their association with the risk of death among laboratory-confirmed cases of covid-19 patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without a greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes a thorough assessment of comorbidities may help establish risk stratification of patients with covid-19 upon hospital admission  a significance of high prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in severe covid-19 patients hidekatsu yanai   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has reached a pandemic level in a recent retrospective cohort study of covid-19 comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension were present in nearly half of patients 1 the odds of in-hospital death were significantly higher in patients with diabetes 285 and hypertension 305 1 it remains unknown why the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension is high in covid-19 patients and why such diseases can be risk for severe covid-19 including death to elucidate such clinical questions i searched the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension and the controlling status of such diseases in all covid-19 patients severe and non-severe covid-19 patients using pubmed the prevalence of each disease in severe and non-severe covid-19 patients was meta-analyzed by petos exact method and odds ratio or with 95 confidence interval ci was shown the prevalence of diabetes in all covid-19 patients severe and non-severe covid-19 patients were shown in table 1 1-12 half of studies showed a statistically significantly higher prevalence of diabetes in severe patients than in non-severe patients in the meta-analysis the prevalence of diabetes in severe patients was significantly higher than that in non-severe patients or 352 95 ci 265 - 467 unfortunately only three studies were available to analyze the controlling status of diabetes all three studies showed that plasma glucose levels in severe patients were significantly higher than those in non-severe patients although such data did not present sufficient evidence elevation of plasma glucose is likely to be associated with severity of covid-19 zhu et al performed a retrospective multi-centered study of 7337 cases of covid-19 in hubei province china among which 952 had pre-existing type 2 diabetes 13 they found that subjects with type 2 diabetes required more medical interventions and had a significantly higher mortality 78 vs 27 and multiple organ injury than the non-diabetic individuals further well-controlled blood glucose was associated with markedly lower mortality compared to individuals with poorly controlled blood glucose supporting a significance of hyperglycemia in severe covid-19 the prevalence of hypertension in all covid-19 patients severe and non-severe covid-19 patients was shown in table 2 1-12 five of 12 studies showed a statistically significantly higher prevalence of hypertension in severe patients than in non-severe patients in the meta-analysis the prevalence of hypertension in severe patients was significantly higher than that in non-severe patients or 269 95 ci 216 - 334 seven studies were available to analyze the controlling status of hypertension five studies did not show any difference in blood pressure between severe and non-severe patients huang et al showed that systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in severe patients than in non-severe patients 2 itelman et al showed that minimal systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in severe patients than in non-severe patients and maximal systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in severe patients than in non-severe patients 11 blood pressure itself is unlikely to be associated with severity of covid-19 since hypertension is one of the most significant risk factors for severe disease and mortality in covid-19 and angiotensin-converting enzyme ace 2 is the entry receptor of sars-cov-2 14 15 the effects of ace inhibitors aceis and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs in covid-19 patients have received much focus a recent study has shown the protective effects of aceisarbs against mortality in covid-19 16 challenging the association between aceisarbs use and severe covid-19 why is hypertension one of the most significant risk factors for severe disease and mortality in covid-19 diabetes and hypertension are crucial coronary risk factors and diabetes and hypertension are closely interlinked because of similar risk factors such as endothelial dysfunction vascular inflammation arterial re-modelling atherosclerosis dyslipidemia and obesity 17 common mechanisms such as upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system oxidative stress inflammation and activation of the immune system likely contribute to the close relationship between diabetes and hypertension 17 high prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in severe covid-19 patients can be explained by such vascular damage the prevalence of cardiovascular disease cvd in all covid-19 patients severe and non-severe covid-19 patients was shown in table 3 1-8 10-12 four of 11 studies showed a statistically significantly higher prevalence of cvd in severe patients than in non-severe patients in the meta-analysis the prevalence of cvd in severe patients was significantly higher than that in non-severe patients or 537 95 ci 373 - 774 further cvd was significantly associated with increased odds of death or 214 1 supporting a significant association between vascular damage and severity of covid-19 d-dimer is detected in injured vascular endothelium 18 and von willebrand factor is produced by endothelial cells in response to injury and high von willebrand factor level has been observed in systemic vasculitis 19 multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with d-dimer greater than 1 gml or 1842 95 ci 264 - 12855 p  00033 on admission 1 elevated von willebrand factor levels were observed in covid-19 patients in the intensive care unit 20 d-dimer was also reported to be significantly increased in kawasaki disease with coronary artery lesions and to be the independent risk for coronary artery lesions in kawasaki disease 21 von willebrand factor parameters were reported to represent potential biomarkers for disease activity and coronary artery lesion in patients with kawasaki disease 22 a very recent article reported the development of kawasaki disease in covid-19 patient 23 supporting an association between endothelial injury and severe covid-19 in conclusion endothelial injury may be associated with severity of covid-19 which can partially explain high prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in severe covid-19  the saga continues is covid-19 a cardiopulmonary disease thomas lscher f   
 for the podcast associated with this article please visit httpsacademicoupcomeurheartjpagespodcasts since last november almost 55 million confirmed covid-19 infections and 350 000 deaths have been reported1 as evidence is mounting it has become clear that while covid-19 initially affects the airways and lungs the inflammatory storm occurring later during the infection also involves the cardiovascular system and leads to venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism2 heart blocks3 myocardial infarction as well as myocarditis46 and heart failure7 furthermore any cardiac condition seems to represent a major risk factor for an unfavourable outcome of the covid-19 infection finally and less apparent initially the lockdown in all affected countries produced extensive collateral damage as patients were afraid to visit hospitals for acute cardiac conditions and were deprived of necessary care as outpatient and elective inpatient services had been cancelled this second focus issue on covid-19 and cardiovascular disease addresses all these issues and starts with the fast track association of hypertension and antihypertensive treatment with covid-19 mortality a retrospective observational study by fei li and colleagues from china they investigated whether the treatment of hypertension especially with reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas inhibitorsas suggested initially8would influence the mortality of all patients with covid-19 infection admitted to the huo-shen-shan hospital in wuhan china9 this hospital was designed only for treating covid-19 and opened on 5 february 2020 hypertension and its treatment were stratified according to medical history or medications prior to the infection among 2877 patients 295 had a history of hypertension after adjustment for confounders patients with hypertension had a two-fold increased relative mortality risk as compared with those without hypertension patients with a history of hypertension but without antihypertensive treatment had an even higher risk of mortality compared with those with treatment with a hazard ratio of 217 a quarter of the patients were treated with at least one raas inhibitor while the rest received beta-blockers calcium antagonists or diuretics in those on raas inhibitors mortality was numerically lower but did not reach significance figure 1 thus in this largest cohort published so far on that issue hypertension appears independently associated with mortality from covid-19 furthermore these data do not support the hypothesis that raas inhibitors worsen outcomes among persons with this infection these important findings are put into context of the debate on the role of ace2 and covid-19 in a thought-provoking editorial by luis ruilope from the hospital 12 de octubre in madrid spain10 troponins are known risk factors for outcome in patients with acute coronary syndromes1112 heart failure13 valvular heart disease14 pulmonary embolism14 and even normal individuals as such it was important also to study this aspect in patients with covid-19 infection in their article entitled characteristics and clinical significance of myocardial injury in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 bo yang and colleagues from the wuhan university renmin hospital in china investigated this aspect in 671 patients with severe covid-19 infection15 of those 92 died these patients had more comorbidities and more commonly had myocardial injury ie 758 vs 99 than survivors the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i for in-hospital mortality was 092 the optimal cut-off points ie 0026 ngml and high levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i predicted in-hospital death with a hazard ratio of 456 and 125 respectively in multivariable logistic regression older age comorbidities such as hypertension coronary artery disease chronic renal failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a high level of c-reactive protein were predictors of myocardial injury thus risk of in-hospital death among patients with severe covid-19 is predictable by markers of myocardial injury which were associated with an inflammatory response and cardiovascular comorbidities these clinically important findings are accompanied by an editorial by hugo katus from the university hospital heidelberg in germany and colleagues16 additionally the covid-19 pandemic affected not only those with the infection but also cardiac patients at large it appears that the recommendations of governmental agencies to stay at home most probably deterred cardiac patients from visiting a hospital when acute symptoms occurred as outlined in the article reduction of hospitalizations for myocardial infarction in italy in the covid-19 era authored by ciro indolfi from the division of cardiology magna graecia university in catanzaro italy and colleagues of the societ italiana di cardiologia and the ccu academy investigators group17 they conducted a multicentre observational nationwide survey on admissions for acute myocardial infarction at italian intensive cardiac care units over a 1-week period during the covid-19 outbreak compared with the equivalent week in 2019 they observed a 485 reduction in admissions compared with the equivalent week in 2019 the reduction was significant for both st-segment elevation myocardial infarction stemi admission with a 265 reduction and non-stemi nstemi with a 654 reduction among stemis the reduction was greater for women with 412 than for men with 178 a similar reduction in acute myocardial infarction admissions was registered in north italy 521 central italy 593 and surprisingly also in southern italy 521 where fewer covid-19 cases were observed thus the covid-19 pandemic has led to a significant collateral damage even in non-covid-19 patients with cardiac disease as outlined in an insightful editorial by m chadi alraies from wayne state university in washington dc usa18 the causes may be multifactorial and may be related to the fact that patients may have been afraid to visit hospital during the pandemic or that fewer plaque ruptures occurred due to the standstill of life during the lockdown finally a comprehensive review entitled covid-19 from epidemiology to treatment by jose miro and colleagues from the hospital clinicidibaps in barcelona spain reminds us that cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons must be aware now of virus infections in their patients and on their impact in general19 healthcare workers should be educated and trained to tackle the enormous challenge posed by sars-cov-2 and other viruses in wards operating theatres icus and cardiac catheterization laboratories this review provides the necessary knowledge about covid-19 and focuses on relevant aspects on prevention and management for specialists within the cardiovascular field as much as patients and the clinical service suffered from the covid-19 pandemic so did research and running clinical trials in particular indeed in most countries any running protocols were stopped which impacted on the recruitment follow-up and eventually the integrity safety and results of such trials this issue is discussed in the current opinion article conducting clinical trials in heart failure during and after the covid-19 pandemic an expert consensus position paper from the heart failure association hfa of the european society of cardiology esc by stefan anker from the charit in berlin germany and colleagues figure 220 for heart failure trials covid-19 may be particularly impactful as patients with heart failure are likely to be at greater risk of infection with covid-19 and the consequences might also be more serious furthermore they are also at risk of adverse outcomes if their clinical care is compromised the authors note that as physicians and clinical trialists it is our moral and ethical duty to ensure safe and effective care is delivered to trial participants without affecting the integrity of the trial many regulatory authorities from different world regions have issued guidance statements regarding the conduct of clinical trials during this covid-19 crisis however international trials may benefit from expert guidance from a global panel of experts to supplement local advice and regulations thereby enhancing the safety of participants and the integrity of the trial accordingly the heart failure association of the european society of cardiology conducted web-based meetings with clinical trialists in europe north america south america australia and asia in this article the authors highlight the challenges this pandemic poses for the conduct of clinical trials in heart failure and offers advice on how they might be overcome with some practical examples while this panel of experts are focused on heart failure clinical trials these discussions and recommendations may apply to clinical trials in other therapeutic

takizawa nobuyuki ura kazuaki shimamoto   since the beginning of the twenty-first century epidemic outbreaks of deadly pneumonia have been caused by three coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and sars-cov-2 in december 2019 an outbreak of the third epidemic caused by sars-cov-2 started in wuhan hubei china 1 and the disease named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who has become a worldwide pandemic and has posed global threats to health and economic stability hypertension diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease as comorbidities increase susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection particularly in elderly individuals 14 these comorbidities have been suggested to be risks for the development of severe outcomes in covid-19 36 among the comorbidities the prevalence of hypertension in patients with covid-19 was reported to be relatively high 26 most of the covid-19 patients with hypertension had probably been treated with antihypertensive drugs including commonly used renin-angiotensin system ras inhibitors however the causal relationship between the treatment of hypertension and mortality in covid-19 is unclear the ras plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure electrolyte balance and fluid homeostasis 7 angiotensin-converting enzyme ace cleaves angiotensin i ang i to angiotensin ii ang ii and ang ii signals through angiotensin ii type 1 receptor at1r and angiotensin ii type 2 receptor at2r 7 fig 1 ang ii signaling through at1r mediates the effects of vasoconstriction inflammation and fibrosis whereas at2r activation has opposing effects through vasodilation the antiinflammatory response and antifibrosis effects 7 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 a homolog of ace has distinct enzyme active sites and is a key counterregulatory enzyme that degrades ang ii to ang-17 thereby attenuating its effects on vasoconstriction sodium retention inflammation and fibrosis through the mas receptor 7 ace2 also cleaves angiotensin i to angiotensin-19 7 the effects of ace2 are not suppressed by ace inhibitors aceis 7 under normal physiological conditions activities of the aceang iiat1r axis aceang iiat2r axis and ace2ang-17mas receptor axis are in a dynamic equilibrium state maintaining the normal function of the corresponding system 7 aceis and at1r blockers arbs not only inhibit the aceang iiat1r pathway but also modulate the aceang iiat2r pathway and ace2ang-17mas receptor pathway 7 previous studies have revealed a cell-specific expression pattern of ace2 in multiple organs and ace2 is broadly expressed in the heart kidneys and intestine as well as in alveolar epithelial cells of the lungs which are the principal target of and the main site of injury caused by sars-cov-2 8 under normal conditions ace2 expression in the lungs is lower than that in other organs including the heart kidneys and intestine 8 the degree of expression and the biological relevance of ace2 may vary depending on the tissue and clinical state the functional role of ace2 in the lungs appears to be relatively minimal under normal conditions 9 but ace2 may be upregulated in certain clinical states probably for organ protection it has been shown in experimental models that ace2 is upregulated by relatively high doses of aceis and arbs in the heart kidneys and arteries leading to organ protection 10 however the evidence was not always consistent among the diverse ras inhibitors or distinct organs 10 in the tanno-sobetsu study a japanese population-based cohort we previously showed that the urinary level of ace2 which is derived mainly from the kidneys was significantly higher in hypertensive patients who had been treated with olmesartan an arb for more than 1 year than in untreated control subjects and patients who had been treated with calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and long-acting nifedipine the acei enalapril or other arbs including losartan candesartan valsartan and telmisartan 11 this finding suggests that olmesartan uniquely increases renal expression and urinary excretion of ace2 potentially leading to additional renal protection via pleiotropic effects however data showing the effects of ras inhibitors including aceis and arbs on the expression of ace2 in the lungs are lacking in experimental animal models and in humans similar to the entry receptor of sars-cov in sars sars-cov-2 in covid-19 invades the host through ace2 as the host cellular receptor for the viral spike protein 12 fig 1 therefore the expression and distribution of ace2 are key determinants for coronavirus entry into cells two distinct mechanisms for sars-cov-2 infection have been reported endocytosis by ace2-binding sars-cov-2 entry 13 14 and transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2-mediated cleavage of sars-cov-2 accompanied by ace2 12 14 fig 1 given that ace2 is the receptor that allows coronavirus entry into cells pretreatment with ras inhibitors such as aceis and arbs might modulate sars-cov-2 infection and the development of lung injury and other organ damage caused by the virus it has been reported that sars-cov infection in sars reduces ace2 expression resulting in lung injury via an imbalance between the aceang iiat1r axis and the ace2ang-17mas receptor axis 15 in addition exposure to the sars-cov spike protein in a mouse model induced acute lung injury which was rescued by losartan an arb 15 indicating that activation of the aceang iiat1r pathway is involved in lung injury it has also been shown that dysregulation of ace2 mediates acute lung injury in mouse models of infection by other viruses such as influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus 16 furthermore continued viral infection and replication contribute to reduced membrane ace2 expression in cultured cells 16 after the initial engagement of the sars-cov-2 spike protein there is a subsequent downregulation of ace2 abundance on cell surfaces as seen in sars-cov 15 under such conditions ace2 which converts ang ii to ang-17 is unable to exert protective effects in organs it has been reported that ang ii levels were higher in patients with covid-19 n  12 than in healthy controls n  8 and that elevated plasma ang ii levels were correlated with the total viral load and degree of lung injury 17 data regarding the effects of ras inhibitors on lung-specific expression of ace2 are lacking however even if ras inhibitors modify the expression of ace2 in the lungs there is a possibility of facilitation of greater engagement and entry of the sars-cov-2 spike protein during sars-cov-2 infection conversely a possible increase in ace2 expression induced by ras inhibitors would protect against lung injury and other organ damage in covid-19 by inhibiting downregulation of ace2-induced activation of the aceang iiat1r pathway fig 1 clinical trials are currently underway to test the safety and efficacy of several arbs including losartan clinicaltrialsgov number nct04312009 nct04311177 and nct04335123 valsartan nct04335786 and telmisartan nct04355936 in patients with covid-19 on the other hand ace2 a membrane-bound enzyme is distinctly shed from the membrane by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 adam17 and a soluble form of ace2 exists in body fluids 18 fig 1 in pathological states shedding of ace2 is increased resulting in elevated soluble ace2 levels in blood urine and other body fluids 19 it has been suggested that a soluble recombinant ace2 protein intercepts the virus from binding to membrane-anchored ace2 in the cell plasma membrane 20 restoration of ace2 through administration of recombinant ace2 was reported to reverse lung injury in mouse models of other viral infections 21 furthermore treatment with recombinant human ace2 safely reduced ang ii levels in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome 22 clinical trials to test whether administration of recombinant ace2 protein may be beneficial in restoring balance to the ras network and potentially preventing organ injury have also been arranged in patients with covid-19 nct04287686 and nct04335136 possible induction of ace2 in lungs by ras inhibitors would result in increased soluble ace2 and may have a beneficial effect of protection from membrane-anchored ace2-mediated infection with sars-cov-2 fig 1 because of a lack of evidence there are still concerns about an increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection and worsening lung injury in covid-19 patients receiving ras inhibitors however withdrawal of ras inhibitors or switching from ras inhibitor therapy to another antihypertensive therapy may require careful follow-up to avoid unstable control of blood pressure clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the effects of continuation nct04357535 switching nct04330300 and discontinuation nct04353596 and nct04329195 of aceis and arbs in covid-19 patients based on the currently available evidence multiple societies of the specialty announced that administration of ras inhibitors should be continued in stable hypertensive patients who are at risk for are being evaluated for or have covid-19 23 interestingly it has been reported that covid-19 patients with hypertension who were receiving a ras inhibitor an acei or an arb n  17 had a significantly lower peak viral load of sars-cov-2 in cells than did covid-19 patients who were not receiving a ras inhibitor n  25 24 in a retrospective multicenter study in hubei china the unadjusted mortality rate was significantly lower in covid-19 patients with hypertension taking an acei or arb n  188 37 than in those not taking an acei or arb n  940 98 25 furthermore a mixed-effect cox model after adjustment for age sex comorbidities and in-hospital medications showed that the risk for all-cause mortality was lower in a group of patients treated with an acei or arb than in a group of patients not treated with an acei or arb 25 on the other hand according to a report in the new york city area mortality rates for patients with hypertension who were not taking an acei or arb n  953 those who were taking an acei n  168 and those who were taking an arb n  245 were 267 327 and 306 respectively though the results were unadjusted for known confounders including age sex race ethnicity socioeconomic status and comorbidities 2 further detailed investigations using a large number of patients regarding ras inhibitors and covid-19 need to be addressed

 as of 4 april 2020 1139207 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 have been reported worldwide 1 examination of the full-length genome revealed that the coronavirus responsible for covid-19 namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a -coronavirus in the same subgenus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus but in a different clade 2 the structure of the receptor-binding gene region is very similar to that of the sars coronavirus in which both employ the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 for cell entry 2 ace2 a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system ras is a homolog of ace where its expression can be identified principally in the heart kidney and airway epithelial cells 3 it functions as a carboxypeptidase by converting angiotensin ii to angiotensin-17 thereby opposing the vasoconstrictive effect of angiotensin ii 4 currently available epidemiological studies have reported an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease cvd including hypertension among patients who developed a severe subtype of covid-19 510 for example the study by guan et al 5 which is one of the earliest analyses of the characteristics of chinese patients with covid-19 reported that the prevalence of coronary heart disease was more than fourfold higher among patients who developed the combined primary endpoint of admission to an intensive care unit mechanical ventilation or death relative to patients with less severe outcomes in addition more recent studies 9 10 that evaluated covid-19-associated cardiac injury observed a high prevalence of hypertension 598635 coronary heart disease 293327 cardiomyopathy 154 and chronic heart failure 146 among covid-19 patients complicated with cardiac injury which is independently associated with mortality with covid-19 since then researchers tend to favor an association of cvd with the severity of covid-19 11 12 nevertheless interpreting such an association should be done with caution since the validity of such an association is hampered by an unclear definition of cvd including hypertension adopted in these studies 510 without knowing the baseline cvd status of patients it is hard to suggest that cvd is an added risk factor for developing severe covid-19 infection moreover the available studies originated from china therefore the generalizability of such an association to the global population is limited patients with underlying cvd are likely to experience excessive morbidity from any cause because they have diminished circulatory reserve to meet the excessive demands on the cardiovascular system furthermore since the prevalence of cvd is increased with age age may act as a confounding factor available studies also reported that older patients with covid-19 tend to develop a severe course of the disease including the development of cardiac injury 510 future studies with age-stratified analysis could shed some light on the association of cvd with the severity of covid-19 infection on the other hand some researchers have called to consider the safety of ras inhibitors including ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii type i receptor blockers arbs among patients with covid-19 11 12 there has been speculation that patients with covid-19 who are receiving these agents may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes given that ace2 is a functional receptor for sars-cov-2 and ras inhibitors can increase ace2 levels 11 12 however an increased level of ace2 upon exposure to ras inhibitors has not been a universal finding while some animal studies 1318 have noticed an increased expression of ace2 upon exposure to ace inhibitors or arbs other studies reported otherwise 19 20 the findings from human studies 2124 have discredited the association of levels of ace2 with the use of ace inhibitors and arbs although one study 25 did notice an increased urinary secretion of ace2 in hypertensive patients treated with the arb olmesartan but not with other ace inhibitors and arbs furthermore another study 26 demonstrated an increased gene expression for ace2 in the small intestine of patients under ace inhibitorarb treatment compared with untreated controls in addition the elevation of serum ace2 was only found in patients with unsatisfactory blood pressure control utilizing ace inhibitor therapy as reported in a study among hypertensive subjects 27 therefore the effect of ras inhibitors on ace2 among human subjects is mainly due to the expression of ace2 in the plasma kidney and gastrointestinal system and is not the known effect if any of ras inhibitors on the expression of ace2 in human airway epithelial cells furthermore increased expression of ace2 did not correspond to increased ace2 activity in an animal study 16 and it is not known if the biological effect on ace2 would wane immediately upon discontinuation of ace inhibitors and arbs the role of ace2 in coronavirus infection is still controversial although ace2 is a prerequisite for infectivity of sars-cov the presence of other co-factors seems to be important for efficient cellular infection since sars-cov was also identified in cell types lacking ace2 expression 28 in addition the upregulation of ace2 is not entirely harmful since paradoxically an increased level of ace2 might protect against coronavirus-induced lung injury 29 binding of the coronavirus spike protein to ace2 leads to ace2 downregulation which in turn results in excessive production of angiotensin ii 30 as angiotensin ii increases pulmonary vascular permeability it could produce lung injury and impair lung function 30 31 coincidentally a study that investigated the clinical and biochemical parameters of patients with covid-19 observed that levels of angiotensin ii were higher compared with healthy controls 32 moreover angiotensin ii levels were linearly associated with lung injury supporting the hypothesis that angiotensin ii is responsible for lung injury in covid-19 as previously mentioned the clinical course of covid-19 can be complicated by cardiac injury manifested by increased biomarkers which portends a worse prognosis and ace2 plays a significant role in myocardial recovery response 9 10 33 indeed in some of the heart samples from patients who died from sars the presence of viral rna was identified which was associated with reduced ace2 protein expression 34 the safety issue of ace inhibitors and arbs has since created great concerns on social media sites but emerging data are reassuring a retrospective observational study 35 published in the chinese language reported that the use of ace inhibitors or arbs did not differ significantly between patients who recovered and patients who died from covid-19 suggesting that the use of ras inhibitors may not result in worse prognosis although a conclusion on the safe use of ras inhibitors could not be firmly drawn from this study due to the limited number of patients receiving ras inhibitors n  22 however another recent retrospective study 36 reported that covid-19 patients with underlying hypertension taking ace inhibitorsarbs had a much lower proportion of critical disease 93 vs 229 p  0061 and a lower mortality rate 47 vs 133 p  0283 than their hypertensive counterparts not receiving an ace inhibitorarb furthermore patients taking ace inhibitorsarbs had significantly lower levels of c-reactive protein and procalcitonin when compared with patients not receiving an ace inhibitorarb suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory function in covid-19 ras inhibitors could be indicated for chronic heart failure or chronic kidney disease in which self-discontinuation of these agents without prior consultation with physicians may lead to decompensation within days to weeks further compromising cardiopulmonary reserve in patients at risk of covid-19 37 38 the benefits that are specific to ace inhibitorsarbs may not be recapitulated by other antihypertensive agents for these diseases while no data have been reported on the effect of temporary discontinuation of ras inhibitors on mortality among patients with covid-19 the shreds of evidence extrapolated from other patient settings suggest harm in which studies from the veterans affairs healthcare system showed that non-resumption of arbs within 2 days or ace inhibitors within 14 days after surgery was associated with higher 30-day mortality rates 39 40 the risk of fall in the elderly population from abruptly stopping long-term medication eg ace inhibitors could result in significant adverse consequences by increasing the risk of fractures and bleeding in conclusion although cvd has been reported as one of the most common comorbidities among patients with severe covid-19 the association of cvd with the severity of covid-19 has yet to be confirmed since thus far there is no biological connection between cvd and viral replication in addition the established benefits of ace inhibitors and arbs in cvd outweigh the uncertain risks among patients at risk of covid-19 since available evidence demonstrated no direct pathological relationship between ras blockade and covid-19 therefore we echo the position statements table 1 of some of the major cardiovascular societies 41 to discourage the discontinuation of ace inhibitors or arbs in patients with covid-19 such statements should provide reassurance to clinicians who would like to continue using ace inhibitors and arbs among patients at risk of covid-19 furthermore an ongoing clinical trial of covid-19-infected patients receiving an ace inhibitorarb randomized to either an alternative antihypertensive medication or continuation of the ace inhibitorarb therapy may provide a definitive answer to this debate 42  risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 a 1 systematic review and meta-analysis of retrospective studies mohammad parohan sajad

with pneumonia of unknown cause appeared in wuhan hubei province china by 7 january 2020 china rapidly isolated the novel coronavirus and shared the viral genome sequence to world health organization who 1 the novel coronavirus was identified as a novel enveloped rna betacoronavirus and named 2019 novel coronavirus later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses which has a phylogenetic similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov but the contagosity is higher than sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 2 in order to prevent the epidemic of this contagion chinese government made a decision to temporarily shut down the traffic departing from wuhan on 23 january 2020 and adopted a series of control measures who declared the spread of sars-cov-2 was listed as a public health emergency of international concern and subsequently designated the pneumonia infected by sars-cov-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 3 until 19 april 2020 covid-19 has swept across 213 countries and regions which reported 2 245 872 confirmed cases and 152 707 deaths the largest number of confirmed cases were in the united states followed by spain and italy 4 this phenomenon signified fighting with covid-19 is not only a matter for china but an imperative event for global nowadays the majority of studies on covid-19 in china are focused on wuhan the hardest-hit area and little is known about the clinical features of covid-19 outside of wuhan 57 the study of chang et al 8 included 13 cases in beijing and the research of xu et al 9 enrolled 62 cases in zhejiang however due to the small sample size clinical characteristics might be not comprehensive researches with a larger number of confirmed cases were urgently needed outside of wuhan the clinical spectrum of covid-19 appears to be wide comprising mild type without pneumonia common type with pneumonia severe type with respiratory distress and critical type with respiratory failure shock or even death 10 diverse subtypes have their unique features whether in epidemiology or laboratory results a study with 72 314 cases reported by the chinese center for disease control and prevention china cdc showed that the case-fatality rate was 490 among critical cases 11 therefore mastering the characteristics of different subtypes and early identification of the severity of illness is of great significance for the treatment hence the aim of our study is to summarize the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics laboratory and radiograph findings treatments and outcomes of different subtypes of patients with covid-19 in zhejiang province on this basis we want to explore risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with covid-19 and appeal to clinicians to attach importance to these factors we conducted a retrospective study investigating on the epidemiological clinical laboratory radiograph treatments and outcomes characteristics of confirmed cases of covid-19 in zhejiang province from 17 january to 12 february 2020 diagnosis of covid-19 was in accordance with the interim guidance from the who 12 a confirmed case of covid-19 was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay of sputum and throat swab specimens only laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled in our study data were uniformly collected by the health commission of zhejiang province where all patients were allocated at specific hospitals for unified treatment according to the government emergency rule all data enrolled in our study had been shared with who and the preliminary results were reported to the authority of zhejiang province information of medical records were gathered and sent to the data collection center in hangzhou demographic epidemiological clinical laboratory treatments and outcomes data were exacted from electronic medical records using a standardized data collection form a group of doctors who have experiences in treating the patients with covid-19 reviewed and disposed the data when

 the outbreak of covid-19 is now becoming an enormous threat to public health with further research of the structure and infection mechanism of respiratory scientists found angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 might be the site of sars-cov-2 binding on the surface of cells with the same route of infection of sars-cov 14 it has been proved that ace2 might play an important role in virus transmission and infection sars-cov-2 not only attacked the lung but also caused damages to many other organs including heart kidney liver and central nervous system 3 6 15 16 the diagnosis of covid-19 was complicated by the diversity in symptoms imaging findings and the severity of illness therefore describing features of each subtype and exploring risk factors for the severity of illness could help clinicians to better tackle with this disease in this respective study the median age of critical types was higher than the other three types with the reason of low immunity and degeneration of related physiological function in older the length of the incubation period is related to many factors such as the number of pathogens the time required for toxin production and transmission and human immunity the incubation period was shorter in severe type probably due to poor immunity and higher viral load 17 fever and cough were the dominant symptoms in all subtypes while hemoptysis was rare fever is a protective mechanism by activating the immune systems to resist pathogens and cough is a reflective defense against invaders when an individual was infected the above two symptoms generally appeared at early stage although hemoptysis was an atypical symptom it was reported that there was covid-19 patient admitted only with hemoptysis as the initial symptom 18 moreover we should be alert to the patients who didnt have a fever due to 66 of severe type without fever in our study hypertension and diabetes were the most pervasive underlying diseases in all subtypes and the proportion of them were higher in critical type in consideration of the aged constituting the majority of the critical type it is common that the rates of comorbidities increased according to the laboratory results the decrease of lymphocyte occurred in 706 of critical type the decrease of lymphocyte was a prominent feature of critical type in our cohort which was consistent with a previous study 19 sars-cov-2 might mainly act on lymphocyte especially t lymphocytes as did sars-cov 6 in addition the increased ast and ldh implied a potential of liver and heart damage which was more common in severe and critical types currently there is no effective antiviral treatment for covid-19 20 in the light of the previous clinical experience interferon- lopinavirritonavir and arbidol were applied for antiviral therapy in our hospital however the therapeutic regimen was not researched a consensus among hospitals a retrospective study identified that proper use of corticosteroid in critical type with sars could lead to a lower mortality and shorter hospitalization stay 21 in our study the dosage of glucocorticoids was limited to 4080 mgd to avoid side effects until 12 february 2020 21 cases 404 of mild type 273 cases 415 of common type 27 cases 443 of severe type and 1 case 59 of critical type discharged from hospital compared with initial patients infected with sars-cov-2 in wuhan the illness condition of patients in zhejiang province are relatively milder none of the patients died at the end of our follow-up this feature is obviously different from researches in wuhan which reported a higher mortality 10 19 at early stage of outbreak of covid-19 in wuhan shortage of local medical resources insufficient understanding of this disease and no effective drugs might contribute to this phenomenon several risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with covid-19 were identified in our study including male fever cough hemoptysis gastrointestinal symptoms hypertension and higher age-grading several studies demonstrated that differences in covid-19 disease prevalence and severity were associated with sex which was similar to our results 3 6 19 one study using single-cell sequencing found that expression of ace2 was more predominant in asian men 22 during the evolution females develop enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses than males and are less susceptible to viral infections 23 these above two points might be the reasons for the higher prevalence and severity of covid-19 in men than in women additionally in our study the presence of any one of the comorbidities was higher in male compared with female 307 vs 244 p  0048 we thought this result might also partly explain why men are more prone to severity illness our study found increasing odds of the severity of illness was associated with gastrointestinal symptoms a bioinformatics analysis on single-cell transcriptomes demonstrated that ace2 was not only highly expressed in the lung at2 cells esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells but also in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon recently two independent laboratories from china declared that they have successfully isolated live sars-cov-2 from the stool of patients 24 an increasing number of studies remind us that digestive system might serve as an alternative route of infection for sars-cov-2 25 we consider the digestive tract transmission of sars-cov-2 might impair the function of intestinal mucosal barriers and increase the production of inflammatory factors further aggravating the severity of illness in addition covid-19 patients combined with hypertension were at higher risk for the illness severity in our study renin-angiotensin system ras plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension it could be simply summarized as two axes one is ace-ang ii-at1 axis responsible for constriction of blood vessels and the other is ace2-ang-17-mas axis with the opposite effect 26 27 generally the two axes could interact with each other and maintain the blood pressure balance however the balance would be broken in hypertension with the result of a lower expression of ace2 once infected by sars-cov-2 the level of ace2 would be even lower followed by intensified ang ii activity ang ii would further promote vasoconstriction increase vascular permeability and mediate inflammatory responses leading to illness aggravation there are several limitations in our study firstly the retrospective design of our study might affect integrality of data and diminish its credibility and more prospective cohort studies should be on the agenda in the future secondly patients enrolled in our study only come from zhejiang province and large-scale researches at the national level were urgently needed which could provide more reliable and comprehensive data thirdly changes of the illness in different subtypes needed to be further investigated a model for predicting the changes of disease was necessary for clinicians to better guide treatments moreover laboratory results were not included in ordinal logistic regression model to explore risk factors for the severity of illness due to the normal range of some indicators varied from different hospitals in summary our study reported the largest cases of patients with covid-19 in zhejiang province and indicated risk factors of illness severity which was of great significance for early identification and prompt treatment based on the research findings we recommend that clinicians should pay close attention to these features in patients with covid-19 including older age male fever cough hemoptysis gastrointestinal symptoms and hypertension and strengthen self-protection during the outbreak of covid-19  a proposed plan for prenatal care to minimize risks of covid-19 to patients and providers focus on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy hypertensive disorders are the most common medical complications of pregnancy and a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and death the detection of elevated blood pressure during pregnancy is one of the cardinal aspects of optimal antenatal care with the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and the risk for person-to-person spread of the virus there is a desire to minimize unnecessary visits to health care facilities women should be classified as low risk or high risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and adjustments can be accordingly made in the frequency of maternal and fetal surveillance during this pandemic all pregnant women should be encouraged to obtain a sphygmomanometer patients monitored for hypertension as an outpatient should receive written instructions on the important signs and symptoms of disease progression and provided contact information to report the development of any concern for change in status as the clinical management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is the same assessment of urinary protein is unnecessary in the management once a diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is made pregnant women with suspected hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and signs and symptoms associated with the severe end of the disease spectrum eg headaches visual symptoms epigastric pain and pulmonary edema should have an evaluation including complete blood count serum creatinine level and liver transaminases aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase further if there is any evidence of disease progression or if acute severe hypertension develops prompt hospitalization is suggested current guidelines from the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog and the society for maternal-fetal medicine smfm for management of preeclampsia with severe features suggest delivery after 34 07 weeks of gestation with the outbreak of covid-19 however adjustments to this algorithm should be considered including delivery by 30 07 weeks of gestation in the setting of preeclampsia with severe features key points  outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 warrants fewer office visits  women should be classified for hypertension risk in pregnancy  earlier delivery suggested with covid-19 and hypertensive disorder barton john r  saade george r  sibai baha m antihypertensive drugs and risk of covid-19  authors reply lei fang george karakiulakis michael roth   we thank joshua brown kevin lo and colleagues and christopher tignanelli and colleagues for their responses to our correspondence1 and we welcome the opportunity to reply the fast-developing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first reported from wuhan china2 and has spread globally as of march 22 2020 307 297 people have been infected by sars-cov-2 with 13 049 deaths and 92 382 people recovered several reports have summarised the clinical and epidemiological features of covid-19 and have shown specific comorbidities associated with increased risk of infection and developing into a severe or fatal case of 1099 infected patients 173 had severe disease in whom the most common comorbidities were hypertension 24 diabetes 16 coronary heart disease 6 and cerebrovascular disease 23 in a second cohort of 41 patients hospitalised with covid-194 diabetes 20 hypertension 15 and cardiovascular disease 15 were frequent comorbidities among 191 patients hospitalised with covid-195 the most common comorbidities with significant effects on mortality were hypertension 30 p00008 diabetes 36 p00051 and coronary heart disease 15 p00001 in an analysis of 201 patients with covid-196 84 42 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome with hypertension 27 and diabetes 19 as the most common comorbidities hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease which seem to be the most common comorbidities in patients with covid-19 are typically treated with drugs that inhibit the reninangiotensin system ras including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceis or angiotensin receptor blockers arbs the long history of use and thorough investigation of these drugs means that efficacy and safety of ras inhibitors is very well documented not only for management of blood pressure but also for protection from disease-associated inflammation and organ remodelling7 the high proportion of patients with severe covid-19 and these comorbidities suggests a causative link and led to our hypothesis1 8 which has also been presented by others9 10 based on the drugs most frequently given to patients to treat these comorbidities ie aceis and arbs we postulated whether these drugs might further increase risk for severe or fatal covid-191 this hypothesis is supported by the observation that organ-specific expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 correlates with the vulnerability to infection by sars-cov-211 our concern was initiated after investigating the molecular mechanism by which sars-cov-2 attaches to and infects cells both sars-cov-2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov bind to the host cells membrane via ace212 which is specifically highly expressed by epithelial cells in oral mucosa13 ace2 is a widely expressed protein in lung intestine kidney and blood vessels and on immunoreactive cells11 moreover circulating amounts of ace2 are increased in patients with hypertension or diabetes and levels are further increased by different drugs including aceis and arbs14 15 it should also be emphasised that specific alleles control ace2 expression activity and response to aceis15 in addition to animal models humans given aceis arbs or both had increased ace2 levels on intestine luminal cells16
 in this context it should be noted that modification of glycosylation is essential for binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein inhibition of ace2 glycosylation by either chloroquine hydrochloroquine or a serine protease inhibitor significantly reduces the infection of host cells by sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in vitro17 18 19
 we are aware of the beneficial effects of aceis and arbs protecting the heart and kidney for patients with hypertension and diabetes an opposing hypothesis has suggested that upregulation of ace2 expression or infusion of human recombinant ace2 might protect against sars-cov-2 infections20 21 however it has to be emphasised that the role of ace2 in these protective effects are not well understood12 13 14
 furthermore it should be noted that aceis have been reported to modify the adaptive immune response22 suggesting that long-term use of aceis might suppress the adaptive immune response which is a key defence against viral infections similar effects on the adaptive immune response are known for most non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs these effects need to be addressed in an extended discussion and investigated with clinical trials in the context of the covid-19 pandemic available published data indicate that ace2 is a double-edged sword particularly when considering patients with sars-cov-2 infection and comorbidities of hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease the final answer as to whether drugs to treat these comorbidities ie aceis or arbs are more beneficial than harmful in this current pandemic is unclear and all hypotheses should be investigated rather than being interpreted as evidence this work is of special importance because coronaviruses in general have always been a part of the common influenza season and in the future new sars-cov will probably develop the overinterpretation of our hypothesis should not lead to changing drugs for patients with hypertension or diabetes without first consulting with an expert clinician nevertheless it is of utmost urgency for the scientific and medical community to work together to find evidence-based proof to address these concerns

shows the molecular mechanisms initiated after sars-covs entry into the cells and the significance of ace and ace2 in these processes in the current review we discuss the expression pattern and function of the both ace proteins in relation with the underlying disorders administration of certain medications and the existence of common genomic variants within ace genes to explain the differences in the response of affected individuals to sars-cov-2 in agreement with the role of ace2 on virus uptake by cells up-regulation of human ace2 has increased disease severity in mice infected with sars-cov 15 moreover injecting sars-cov spike into mice has led to down-regulation of ace2 thus aggravating the lung injury 1617 consequently ace2 functions as the cellular receptor for sars-cov entrance but also confers a protective mechanism against lung injury 18 based on these investigations level of expression of ace2 is an important factor in the sars-cov infection thus comorbid conditions that influence expression of this protein might affect severity of disease table 1

ali-induced apoptosis of pulmonary endothelial cells pecs in the current study we reviewed the available literature about the expression pattern of ace peptidases and the influence of various disorders and medications on the levels of these proteins expression level of ace2 has importance in severity of infection with sars-cov-2 and the extent of lung injury 18 most recently human recombinant soluble ace2 hrsace2 has been shown to inhibit growth of sars-cov-2 and interrupt early stages of infections with this virus 91 based on the abundance of genetic modifying factors in determination of ace2 levels it is advisable to create a risk predictive panel to determine propensity for severe infection of individual whole genome sequencing of the patients samples is the best method for identification of genetic variants that determine severity of the disorder if a few genes were recognized that have a significant impact on the variability of covid-19 course a genetic test for coronavirus susceptibility could be simple to make cheap and accurate however much more genes could be involved in this process perhaps a complex regulatory pattern of genetic expression which is involved in the physiology of the lung and upper respiratory tract shape in addition to ace2 might contribute in this disorder assessment of association between ace proteins expression and human disorders has implications in health consequences after recovery from the primary sars-cov-2 infection this would be a next important issue after extinguishing of the pandemia hypertension is reported to be the most common comorbidity in sars-cov-2 infection 92 and the ace protein is a target for ace-inhibitors which are used in the treatment of hypertension to ultimately decrease the amount of ang ii some polymorphisms in ace gene are reported to influence the efficacy of these inhibitors among them is the homozygous ace haplotypes which lead to faster response to ramipril 61 the expression and function of the ace itself are affected by its polymorphisms which are associated with susceptibility to different diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus 93 notably polymorphisms in both ace and ace2 are important in the regulation of the ace2 expression 9495 on the other hand a meta-analysis has reported association between the administration of ace inhibitors and reduction in risk of pneumonia notably ace inhibitors may be more efficient in reducing the risk of pneumonia in asian patients also treatment with ace inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in risk of pneumonia-related mortality compared with controls 96 this may be also related to the dual effect of ace2 in viral infection and protection against acute respiratory distress syndrome although the aceace2 regulation is complicated it seems that in the absence of ace the accumulation of angiotensin i may lead to the upregulation of ace2 whether this could facilitate the viral infection is plausible because ace2 is considered as a specific target for coronavirus treatment 95 it means that the population-based differences in the ace2 expression may affect the efficacy of a future antiviral treatment in brief we summarize that coronaviruses such as sars-cov and sars-cov-2 utilize ace2 receptor for cell entry and infection we know that the most severe consequence of the sars-cov-2 is pneumonia which developes mostly in eldery males and subjects with comorbidities like diabetes kidney disease hypertension 97 besides ace2 has a protective role against acute respiratory distress syndrome thus it can be concluded that decreased ace2 level contributes to severe consequences of sars-cov-2 infection while ace2 is essential for the virus-cell fusion one explanation for this controversy is a viral-induced transitional overexpression of ace2 at the first stage of the infection 98 however a recent in silico analysis of sex bias severity of sars-cov-2 infection did not support the association between ace2 genetic variants and disease severitysex bias in the italian population yet tmprss2 levels and genetic variants were suggested as potential candidate modulators of the disease course 99 accordingly among the top 38 eqtls in ace2 the strongest expression positive eqtl is more prevalent in east asian females 100 we also suggest epigenetic regulation by the potential mirnas targeting on ace2 transcripts the results of the targetscan database wwwtargetscanorg list mir-200c-3p and mir-429 among the most prominent mirnas that target ace2 up-regulation of mir-200c-3p is induced by a viral infection which leads to the downregulation of ace2 13 also mir-421 is proved to downregulate ace2 translation 14  interestingly we have analyzed the well-studied id in ace in iranian patients with multiple sclerosis and reported association between this polymorphism and response to interferon- treatment 71 thus ace ace2 polymorphisms not only can predispose individuals to diverse diseases but also they can modulate response of patients to therapeutic options both activities have implications on the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection and the disease course another research era might be the identification of the difference between aceace2 expression levels and their regulating factors such as the mentioned eqtl and mirnas between patients with severe and mild symptoms in different ethnic groups to find the possible effect of ethnicity gender and the period of the disease on the aceace2 expression in addition to the routine models for investigation of the pathological events during infections tissue engineering methods particularly advanced biomaterials or functionalized scaffolds 101 would provide study models to investigate the potential of such approaches in the treatment of the disorder as an advance in the field of functional studies the obtained results from safe in-vitro models which work without any additive can be applied in human models 102 taken together the data presented above show the diversity of factors that modulate ace ace2 expression both in physiological conditions and in the course of sars-cov-2 infection different levels of expression and function of the ace proteins underlying disorders such as diabetes and hypertension administration of certain medications especially ace inhibitors and calcitriol and the existence of certain genomic variants within ace genes that modulate function or expression of the encoded proteins are possible explanations for the observed difference in the response of individuals to the sars-cov-2 infection exploration of the role of these factors can lead to design of appropriate therapeutic modalities based on the personalized risks such personalized approach is expected to be more effective exploitation of the next generation sequencing methods at both genomic and transcriptomic levels would be a practical strategy in this regard in conclusion the observed differences in the course of sars-cov-2 infection can be attributed to several genetic factors comorbidities and administration of medical regimens that modulate expression of ace proteins  clinical impact of pre-admission antithrombotic therapy in hospitalized patients with covid-19 a multicenter observational study vincenzo russo marco di maio emilio attena angelo silverio fernando scudiero dario celentani corrado lodigiani pierpaolo di micco   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a novel highly pathogenic human coronavirus recently recognized as the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the outbreak sparked in wuhan capital city of hubei province in china and spread rapidly to other countries reaching devastating pandemic proportion 1 italy is the one of the hardest hit countries by covid-19 with more than 200000 laboratory-confirmed cases by may 2 2020 2 the clinical course of covid-19 may be complicated by several life-threatening conditions including sepsis respiratory failure heart failure acute kidney and cardiac injury and septic shock 3 little is still known about the patient clinical characteristics predisposing to the occurrence of these life-threatening conditions acute distress respiratory syndrome ards is one of the most frequent encountered complication of covid-19 and has been associated with significantly lower patients survival during hospitalization although its pathophysiology is not completely understood the interplay between inflammation and coagulation seems to have a central role 4 whether anti-inflammatory drugs and anticoagulants might influence the onset of ards in covid-19 has not yet been investigated the aim of this multicenter study was to evaluate the prevalence of antithrombotic therapies at admission in patients with covid-19 and the potential association between antithrombotic therapy and ards as disease clinical presentation or in-hospital mortality distribution of continuous data was tested with the kolmogorovsmirnov and the shapiro-wilk test normally distributed variables were expressed as mean  standard deviation sd whereas non-normal distributed ones as median and interquartile range iqr categorical variables were reported as numbers and percentages continuous normally-distributed variables were compared by using the student t-test differences between non-normally distributed variables were tested with the mann-whitney u test categorical variables were compared with chi-squared test or fisher exact test when appropriate the unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios rr for the outcomes of interest were calculated using logistic regression models and presented as rr with their 95 confidence intervals ci we used propensity score weighting to account for potential selection bias in treatment assignment between the two study groups average treatment effect weights the propensity score model was developed incorporating all pre-procedural covariates potentially related to the outcome andor treatment decision regardless of their statistical significance or collinearity with other variables included in the model the following baseline covariates were included in the propensity score model age smoke chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd hypertension diabetes coronary artery disease cad heart failure obesity dyslipidemia stroke and chronic kidney disease ckd after weighting standardized mean differences were calculated to assess the balance for all covariates included in the propensity score model values higher than 010 were considered statistically significant for differences among groups for all test a p value 005 was considered statistically significant analysis were performed by using r version

shows the proportion of death according to pre-admission antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in spite of the significant differences among survived and not survived covid-19 patients in baseline characteristics the inverse probability weighting produced a good covariate balance with absolute standardized differences less than 10 for all variables fig 2
shows graphically how the antiplatelet and anticoagulant arms were more balanced in terms of allocation probability respect to patients were not taking anti-thrombotic drugs at admission unadjusted and adjusted regression models for the risk of ards and death according to pre-admission antithrombotic therapy was reported in table 3
 pre-admission antithrombotic therapy with antiplatelets or anticoagulants did not result associated with increased risk of ards at admission and in-hospital mortality in covid-19 patients the main findings of the present study can be summarized as follows a large proportion of patients admitted for covid-19 is on treatment with antithrombotic agents antithrombotic therapy stratified patients with older age and higher prevalence of comorbidities patients who did not survived were older and showed higher prevalence of comorbidities neither antiplatelet therapy nor anticoagulant therapy affected the risk of severe clinical presentation as ards at admission or death during hospitalization among our study population including italian hospitalized covid-19 patients we confirmed the epidemiological association between cardiovascular risk cv factors and the individual susceptibility to sars-cov2 infection as previously described in chinese and american cohort studies 67 particularly hypertension diabetes and coronary artery disease were the most prevalent comorbidities moreover as previously showed by early chinese data 89 the prevalence of cv diseases in particular hypertension was significantly increased in critically ill covid-19 patients with ards compared to those with milder forms of disease and in the same way hypertension and cad were significantly increased in non-survived covid-19 patients compared to survivors among our study population the af prevalence as preexisting comorbidity at admission was 125 higher than expected in general population 10 however no difference in af prevalence has been shown in covid-19 patients with more severe form of disease characterized by ards and poor clinical outcome the pathogenesis of ards in the clinical context of covid-19 may be related to the direct effect of sars-cov-2 on alveolar epithelial cells and to indirect effects of infection-related hypoxia both conditions predisposing to thrombotic events moreover preliminary reports 1112 suggest that a severe inflammatory response and disseminated intravascular coagulation dic may occur in covid-19 patients predisposing to microvascular pulmonary thrombosis based on the pathophysiological hypothesis that covid-19-induced ards patients may be driven by microvascular thrombotic processes we decided to investigated if the pre-admission antithrombotic therapy including both antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs might impact on the clinical course and prognosis of hospitalized covid-19 patients in the present analysis antithrombotic therapy before admission did not influence the clinical presentation covid-19 in terms of ards and in-hospital mortality these results suggest that the pathophysiology of microvascular pulmonary thrombosis in the clinical context of covid-19-induced pneumonia is not influenced by pre-admission antithrombotic treatment probably due to the complex interplay between clotting system activation and the sars-cov2 immuno-mediated inflammatory response two processes that mutually reinforce each other our results should be interpreted in light of the limitations related to the retrospective observational nature of the study larger multicenter prospective studies are required to confirm our preliminary findings although our results need confirmation by prospective studies including a larger population the antithrombotic therapy both antiplatelet and anticoagulant does not seem to show a protective effect in severe forms of covid-19 characterized by ards and rapidly evolving toward death no conflict of interest or any financial support to declare  use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor blockers in context of covid-19 outbreak a retrospective analysis jiuyang xu chaolin huang guohui fan zhibo liu lianhan shang fei zhou yeming wang jiapei yu luning yang ke xie zhisheng huang lixue huang xiaoying gu hui li yi zhang yimin wang frederick hayden g peter horby w bin cao chen wang  the possible effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceis or angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs on covid-19 disease severity have generated considerable debate we performed a single-center retrospective analysis of hospitalized adult covid-19 patients in wuhan china who had definite clinical outcome dead or discharged by february 15 2020 patients on anti-hypertensive treatment with or without aceiarb were compared on their clinical characteristics and outcomes the medical records from 702 patients were screened among the 101 patients with a history of hypertension and taking at least one anti-hypertensive medication 40 patients were receiving aceiarb as part of their regimen and 61 patients were on antihypertensive medication other than aceiarb we observed no statistically significant differences in percentages of in-hospital mortality 28 vs 34 p  046 icu admission 20 vs 28 p  037 or invasive mechanical ventilation 18 vs 26 p  031 between patients with or without aceiarb treatment further multivariable adjustment of age and gender did not provide evidence for a significant association between aceiarb treatment and severe covid-19 outcomes our findings confirm the lack of an association between chronic receipt of reninangiotensin system antagonists and severe outcomes of covid-19 patients should continue previous antihypertensive therapy until further evidence is available  the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak has spread across the world with more than 51 million confirmed cases 1  early reports on clinical characteristics have identified hypertension as the most common comorbidity reported in covid-19 patients 2 3 4 5  zhou et al documented pre-existing hypertension as a risk factor for in-hospital death of covid-19 6  this observation is of great interest since the renin-angiotensin system ras is an important component in regulating blood pressure and the transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensin ii a vasoconstrictor into vasodilatory peptides is also the cellular entry receptor for sars-cov-2 given the common use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceis and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs in patients with cardiovascular diseases 7  there has been wide discussion whether administration of aceiarb might modulate covid-19 disease severity concerns have been raised whether hypertensive patients should stop taking aceiarb and switch to other anti-hypertensive drugs in the context of covid-19 pandemic 8 9  there have also been counter-arguments in favor of the use of aceiarb in covid-19 patients based on previous studies showing that aceiarb are associated with improvements in pneumonia-related outcomes 10 11  as well as a protective role of arbs in sars-cov and influenza infected animals 12 13  the renin-angiotensin system ras plays a central role in regulating blood pressure and maintaining hemodynamic homeostasis in hypovolemic conditions angiotensinogen is serially cleaved by renin and angiotensinconverting enzyme ace into angiotensin i ang i and angiotensin ii ang ii respectively ang ii then acts on the cellular receptor angiotensin ii receptor i at1 to constrict the blood vessels and increases blood pressure fig 1  to counteract this vaso-constrictive effect of ras fig 1 physiology of aceangiiat1 and ace2ang 1-7 mas axes a schematic structures of angiotensin and its derivatives the three-letter codes were used to represent amino acid residues b physiology of angiotensin processing and blood regulation in hypovolemic conditions renin secreted by cells in macula densa in the kidney cleaves angiotensinogen into a decapeptide angiotensin i ang i the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace further cleaves the peptide into an octapeptide angiotensin ii ang ii which acts on the cellular receptor angiotensin ii receptor i at1 to constrict the blood vessels and increases blood pressure yang ace2 is a monocarboxypeptidase transforming the ang ii into angiotensin-1-7 ang 1-7  which binds to the g protein-coupled receptor mas to dilate the blood vessels and counter-balance aceang ii in blood pressure regulation yin figure was generated with biorender the human body has developed another system in an exquisite yin-yang balance the ace2 is a homolog of ace 14 15 that metabolizes ang ii into angiotensin-1-7 ang 1-7  which dilates the blood vessels and counterbalance aceang ii in blood pressure regulation 16 fig  1  of note in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome ards reduced pulmonary levels of ang 1-7 contribute to disease pathogenesis and administration of this peptide or the arb losartan reduces the development of ards 17  the nonangiotensinase function of ace2 was recognized when it was identified to be cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 18  as well as more recently for sars-cov-2 19 20 21  ace2 expression has been documented in various human organs including oral and nasal mucosa lung intestine kidney heart arterialvenous endothelium and others 22 23 24 25  high-quality clinical evidence for aceiarb usage in covid-19 patients is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions whether chronic aceiarb should be continued or stopped 26  several recent retrospective hospital-based studies have reported no adverse or marginal protective effect of aceiarb on the clinical outcomes of covid-19 patients 27 28 29 30 31 32  to contribute to this discussion we have performed a secondary analysis on a previously-reported single-center retrospective cohort of covid-19 patients in wuhan china 6  we previously collected data from 702 hospitalized adult covid-19 patients admitted to jinyintan hospital wuhan china who had definite outcome dead or discharged between december 29 2019 and february 15 2020 6  data were extracted from medical records into an electronic data collection form by two independent researchers their electronic medical records were screened for medical history of hypertension in past medical history or admitting diagnosis and for oral antihypertensive treatment before and during hospitalization the anti-hypertensive treatments we included in the analysis were acei arb -blockers calcium channel blockers ccbs diuretics and others -blockers and traditional chinese medicine patients with definitive long-term anti-hypertensive treatments as either recorded in the medical history or in the prescribed medication chart as standing order during hospitalization were included in the final analysis the comorbidities were either selfreported by the patients or evaluated by attending physicians and recorded in admitting diagnosis the study was approved by the research ethics commission of jinyintan hospital ky-2020-0101 and the informed consent was waived by the research ethics commission fever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 373c sepsis and septic shock were evaluated based on sepsis-3 international consensus 33  ards was diagnosed according to the berlin definition 34  acute kidney injury was defined according to the kdigo clinical practice guidelines 35  diagnosis of acute cardiac injury was made if serum levels of high-sensitive cardiac troponin i was above the 99th percentile upper reference limit 36  secondary infection hypoproteinemia and coagulopathy were defined as previously 6  continuous variables were expressed as median interquartile

death icu admission invasive mechanical ventilation and corresponding odds ratio both with and without adjustment for age and gender were calculated by logistic model comparing patients in aceiarb group with those in non-aceiarb group four previously-reported risk factors for death age history of diabetes qsofa score and ddimer were included in univariable and multivariable analysis with logistic model a 2-sided  less than 005 was considered statistically significant statistical analyses were conducted using sas software version 94 sas institute and spss software version 25 ibm a total of 702 adult laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients admitted to jinyintan hospital who had definite clinical outcome by february 15 2020 were screened in this study of whom 188 patients had a medical history of hypertension among them 101 patients had antihypertensive treatment medications recorded in their medical records and were included in the final analysis the schematic of patient selection is shown in fig 2  patients who took acei or arb as part of their antihypertensive therapy were included in the aceiarb cohort n  40 and those without were categorized in the non-aceiarb cohort n  61 patients in aceiarb group and non-aceiarb group were comparable in age median 665 vs 650 years p  080 and gender distribution male 48 vs 56 p  042 as shown in table 1  they were also in similar phase of the disease with median time from symptom onset to admission being 125 days iqr 85-160 days and 130 days iqr 85-155 days respectively in addition to hypertension patients in two groups also shared similar proportions of comorbidities and smoking history the vital signs and laboratory test results on admission were generally similar between the two groups table 1  comparable proportions of patients in two groups had lymphocyte count less than 08  10 9 l 55 vs 48 p  051 increased serum cardiac troponin i 18 vs 19 p  088 and increased serum d-dimer levels 59 vs 58 p  095 the percentages of heart failure defined as brain natriuretic peptide bnp value  100 pgml on admission were also similar among the two groups 28 vs 27 p  093 values of the inflammatory markers including serum ferritin procalcitonin and interleukin-6 were not different between the two groups nor were chest imaging features distinguishable the sequential organ failure assessment sofa scores in aceiarb group median 20 iqr 10-40 were numerically smaller than those in non-aceiarb group median 40 iqr 20-45 although the difference is not statistically significant p  029 among the 101 patients recorded with anti-hypertensive medication 40 cases had therapies based on aceiarb either as mono-therapy or combined with -blockers ccb thiazide diuretics or spironolactone tables 2 and 3  no usage of sacubitril-valsartan was reported in this cohort the non-aceiarb therapy was mostly based on calcium channel blockers tables 2 and 3  the usage of other anti-hypertensive medications -blocker -blocker and diuretics was comparable between the two groups  table 2  similar percentages of patients were under optimal blood pressure control based on the vital signs taken on admission table 1  chronic treatment on ras antagonists was not associated with statistically significant changes in serum electrolyte sodium and potassium or serum creatinine levels  table 1  compared with the hypertensive patients who were not given aceiarb we observed no significant differences in percentages of in-hospital mortality 28 vs 34 p  046 icu admission 20 vs 28 p  037 or mechanical ventilation 18 vs 26 p  031 in those receiving a regimen that included an acei or arb of note the percentages with these major outcomes were uniformly smaller in aceiarb group similarly numerically fewer patients in aceiarb group developed respiratory failure 43 vs 59 p  010 sepsis 48 vs 59 p  026 or ards 28 vs 36 p  037 heart failure n  coronary heart disease n  12 12 5 13 7 11 10000 respiratory rate24 min n

non-aceiarb groups table  4  we did not include the non-survivors in the analysis for viral-shedding duration because it has been previously reported that non-survivors had prolonged viral shedding until death 6  further multivariable analysis adjusted for age and gender did not provide statistical evidence for association between aceiarb treatment and severe clinical outcome in covid-19 patients  table 5  as previously reported in the total population 6  older age increased d-dimer values 1gml and higher qsofa scores were associated with higher risks of in-hospital mortality in hypertensive covid-19 patients in the logistic model table 6  the hypothesis that acei or arb treatment changes covid-19 disease progression was based in part on potential impact of ras antagonists on ace2 expression theoretically does administration of an acei or arb have an impact on ace2 expression or activity first of all it has been shown that aceis do not affect ace2 activity 15  in terms of ace2 expression olmesartan but not other aceis arbs or calcium channel blockers has been found to increase urinary ace2 levels in hypertensive patients 37 38  also acei treatment has been reported to increase serum ace2 activity in diabetic patients 39  yet the soluble ace2 sace2 levels do not always reflect the tissue ace2 expression in lung or other organs in fact it is reasonable to hypothesize that sace2 may even negatively correlate with tissue ace2 since sace2 is cleaved from the membrane-bound enzyme before being released into the blood stream also it has to be noted that increase in ace2 enzymatic activity does not always match the upregulation of ace2 expression 40 41  therefore change in pulmonary tissue ace2 after acei or arb treatment has to be directly studied to provide answers for this question although studies of upper respiratory tract ace2 expression or ace2 enzyme activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid might provide indirect evidence 42 43  hypertensive animal models might be a surrogate before clinical evidence is available in rat cardiac myocytes ang ii significantly reduces ace2 activity and downregulates ace2 mrna expression these effects can be blocked by the arb losartan indicating that ang ii regulates ace2 24  mice deficient for ace show markedly improved disease in an ards model induced by acid aspiration or sepsis and recombinant ace2 can protect mice from severe acute lung injury 44  in mice and rat models arb treatment consistently increases ace2 mrna and protein levels in heart kidney and aorta tissue although its effect on lung ace2 expression has not been studied also the effects of acei administration on ace2 expression differs among experiment models and tissues 45  animal models of sars-cov-2 infection that recapitulate the pathogenesis of severe covid-19 are needed to better understand the effects of ace inhibitors and arbs in this single-center retrospective study we did not observe difference in clinical presentations of patients with or without aceiarb treatment on admission nor did we find any important differences in severe clinical outcomes namely in-hospital death icu admission and mechanical ventilation in these two groups however our preliminary analysis was limited by the retrospective nature of the cohort its small sample size and possibly nonrecorded data as the prescription records for drugs not directly relevant to covid-19 treatment may be incomplete only patients with complete anti-hypertensive treatment information were included in the analysis but this strategy by excluding about half the hypertensive cases in the original hypertensive cohort reduced statistical power of this study based on the percentages of in-hospital mortality and icu admission reported in this cohort around 500-1000 patients for each group would be necessary to provide  total 101 anti-hypertensive treatment as either mono-therapy or combined therapies a one of 14 patients took valsartan and benazepril all the other 13 patients were on either acei or arb as mono-therapy a means angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor acei or angiotensin ii receptor blocker arb b means -blocker c means calcium channel blocker ccb d means diuretics acei refers to benazepril in this cohort arb medications include valsartan irbesartan telmisartan and candesartan -blockers used in this cohort include metoprolol and bisoprolol ccbs include amlodipine nifedipine felodipine lacidipine and lercanidipine diuretics include hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone other uncommon medications not listed in this table were terazosin -blocker and traditional chinese medicine with un-specified formula statistical difference given two-tailed   005 and   02 although this cohort had enough power to detect the association between older age and increased covid-19 mortality table 6  it is under-powered for the marginal effect of aceiarb on altered clinical outcome if there was association other confounding factors including age should be carefully evaluated before drawing the final conclusion from retrospective analysis it has to be noted that while aceiarb are the most popular anti-hypertensive drug in the us 46  ccbs are more widely used in china 7 47  this partially explains the high ccb usage in the non-aceiarb group tables 2 and 3  after adjustment for the difference of ccb prescription aceiarb still does not show association with covid-19 mortality or 070 95 ci 024 -199 p  05011 we did not observe association between ccb usage and covid-19 mortality either from this cohort data not shown pre-existing heart failure should also be assessed because ras antagonists including acei arb and aldosterone inhibitors were basic treatment options for chronic heart failure proper multivariable adjustment on confounding factors should be implemented in retrospective analysis we did not adjust for history of heart failure concerning the small sample size and the self-reporting nature of this factor we did not have information for viral load of patients on admission because only qualitative rt-pcr test results were available in the medical records it would be interesting to examine whether chronic acei or arb treatment would affect virus replication in future studies similar to our findings no association was observed between aceiarb prescription and poor clinical prognosis or severe disease of covid-19 in several other retrospective cohorts in china 27 28 48 49 or globally 29 30 31 32  compared with these reports patients in this cohort were sicker on admission and the in-hospital mortality was higher 32 this likely related to the study hospital being a referral center with severe cases during early epidemic in wuhan with accumulating information from multiple large cohort studies it seems clear that prior receipt of acei or arb does not bring additional risks of hospital admission or poor prognosis of covid-19 the discussion has therefore been gradually shifted to whether chronic treatment of acei or arb before covid-19 onset is associated with less severe illness acei and arb have been reported with protective effect in a previous metaanalysis for pneumonia-related mortality in general 10  in terms of covid-19 de abajo et al found a decreased risk of covid-19 hospital admission in the subgroup analysis of diabetic patients with ras inhibitors 31  information from other large covid-19 case series and preferably population-based cohort studies optimally linked to serologic testing are necessary to determine whether receipt of acei or arbs are associated with reduced risk of symptomatic sars-cov-2 infection and especially of severe covid-19 illness systematic analysis combining data from multiple studies would be helpful in answering this question there have also been randomized clinical trials in progress studying the efficacy of acute initiation of acei for treatment of covid-19 eg nct04366050 and nct04355429 in conclusion there has been accumulating evidence for no association between chronic aceiarb treatment and severe outcome of covid-19 meanwhile current studies are pointing toward a putative protective role of prior acei or arb receipt in covid-19 illness which awaits further evidence for confirmation several professional societies have released statements on continuing current anti-hypertensive treatment during the covid-19 pandemic 50  considering the risk of destabilizing blood pressure after changing medications we agree that the best option is to continue previous therapy and wait for further evidence dr

system inhibition role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2  is there any scientific evidence for controversy a aleksova f ferro g gagno c cappelletto d santon m rossi g ippolito a zumla a beltrami p g sinagra   the past 2 decades have witnessed three lethal zoonotic diseases of humans caused by novel coronaviruses the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 the middle east respiratory syndrome mers in april 2012 and currently coronavirus disease19 covid19 caused by sarscov merscov and sarscov2 respectively all three coronaviruses are listed in the who blueprint list for priority pathogens 1 coronaviruses are members of the coronaviridae family a heterogeneous family of rna viruses that cause respiratory tract infections in humans hcov229e hcovnl63 hcovoc43 and hcovhku1 cause mild infections whilst merscov like sarscov and sarscov2 can cause a spectrum of clinical manifestations from mild to severe disease and death 2 the ongoing global pandemic of sars coronavirus2 sarscov2 has affected almost 3 millions of people in all continents 3 the high death rate has been attributed to comorbidities of diabetes hypertension coronary artery disease amongst others 4 reninangiotensin system ras blockers are extensively used worldwide to treat many cardiovascular disorders where they are effective in reducing both mortality and morbidity these drugs are known to induce an increased expression of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 sarscov2 binds to human cells via angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 which is expressed on epithelial cells of the lung kidney intestinal tract and blood vessels 5 ace2 expression is increased in patients with diabetes hypertension treated with ace inhibitors and arbs results in an upregulation of ace2 which theoretically could enhance sarscov2 infection 6 therefore since sarscov2 strongly interacts with ace2 patients undergoing chronic ras blocker treatment may be more prone to sarscov2 infection or develop worse forms of covid19 in this review we will discuss some aspects of the viralcell interaction pathophysiology and the aceisarbs action mechanism lastly we suggest a scientific rationale for continuing ras blockers therapy in patients with covid19 infection thus providing both those clinicians working in the emergency setting and facing with acute cardiovascular diseases and those following outpatients receiving aceiarbs during the covid19 pandemic a basis for their therapeutic decisionmaking as widely described in literature 7 the complex reninangiotensin system ras plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of several morbidities such as hypertension diabetes mellitus myocarditis 8 heart failure and myocardial infarction where the use of ras blockers is essential for management ace inhibitors aceis andor angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs delay or prevent the onset of heart failure in asymptomatic patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and importantly reduce both mortality and morbidity of patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction in these patients aceisarbs are titrated to the upper tolerated dose to achieve adequate ras inhibition 9 10 the most recent esc guidelines recommend employing aceisarbs as antihypertensive treatment to prevent cardiovascular events and heart failure in diabetic patients particularly in those with cardiovascular complications 11 also esc guidelines on hypertension give ia recommendation for employment of aceis and arbs as antihypertensive drugs with demonstrated efficacy in blood pressure and cardiovascular events reduction 12 further hemodynamic changes after an acute myocardial infarction cause a strong activation of both the circulating and the local ras 13 this adaptive response 14 could be dangerous and contributes to the development of cardiac structural and electrophysiological remodelling 15 16 the effects of ras inhibition are beneficial 17 in all patients after a myocardial infarction and are more prominent in more severe patients 18 further in one systematic overview including 100000 patients it was observed that the most significant shortterm survival benefit occurs if treatment with aceis is started within the first 7 days 40 in days 0 to 1 45 in days 2 to 7 15 subsequently 19 in line with this guidelines provide class iaib recommendation to commence aceisarbs treatment within the first 24h after the acute event in all stsegment elevation myocardial infarction stemi patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction heart failure anterior stemi or diabetes 18 20 treatment with aceisarbs is also recommended class iaib in nonstsegment elevation myocardial infarction nstemi patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction heart failure hypertension or diabetes mellitus in order to reduce mortality and risk of recurrent ischaemic event or hospitalization for heart failure 21 22 in the context of sarscov2 infection it is important to note that aceisarbs increase the local expression and activity of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 23 a zinc metalloprotease that exists both as a membraneassociated form and as a secreted form ace2 is ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels of transcripts being found in the lung the heart and the gastrointestinal and urinary systems ace2 is mostly expressed in lung alveolar type ii at2 cells myocardial cells vascular endothelia buccal epithelial cells t and b lymphocytes on the proximal tubule epithelial cells in the kidney and in testes 24 25 all cardiac cell components ie endothelial cells smooth muscle cells cardiac myocytes fibroblasts and macrophages express ace2 although the highest levels were observed in vascular cells especially pericytes 26 27 upregulation of ace2 expression has been documented in patients affected by myocardial infarction or heart failure however in animal models of ageing pressure overload and chronic ischaemia ace2 downregulation has been associated with cardiac hypertrophy adverse remodelling and fibrosis 28 29 30 conversely ace2 expression is reduced in hypertension advanced diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic plaques and experimentally by both angiotensin ii ang ii and endothelin 28 29 30 31 importantly it has been estimated that heritability accounts for 67 of the variability in ace2 circulating levels moreover ace2 genetic variants have been associated with both essential hypertension and coronary heart disease chd whilst they act as disease modifiers of both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies 31 concerning development it was shown that ace2 protein levels and activity are high during gestation and decline postnatally 32 ace2 acts as a negative regulator of ras by degrading angii to the heptapeptide angiotensin 17 ang17 33 that exerts its biological activity via the mas receptor modulating the release of nitric oxide no antagonizing the intracellular effect of angii stimulation thus tempering the production of reactive oxygen species at least in part by activating intracellular phosphatases 34 as a result ang17 exerts many positive effects on the cardiovascular system eg increased endothelial function reduced fibrosis antiproliferative effects on smooth muscle cells anticardiac hypertrophy as well as on other organs such as the lungs where it exerts antifibrotic antiinflammatory and antiapoptotic effects 35 36 37 moreover ace2 cleaves other peptides and plays a central role in inactivating desarginine9bradykinin desarg9bk a potent metabolite of the kininkallikrein system that increases vascular permeability thus promoting angioedema acting on b1 type receptors which are in turn upregulated by inflammatory cytokines 38 39 according to some authors the leakage of plasma in the subendothelial compartment in conjunction with the inflammatory response triggered by the hostvirus interaction may have a central pathogenetic role in the endotheliitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation that have been documented to occur in covid19 patients 39 40 41 ace2 plays an important role in heart failure in diabetic microvascular or macrovascular disease 42 and in inflammatory lung disease 43 and aceisarbsmediated increase in ace2 exerts a protective role in many conditions such as atherosclerosis myocardial infarction myocardial dysfunction heart failure diabetes mellitus and acute lung injury ali coronaviruses sarscov sarscov2 spike s protein binds with high affinity to human ace2 45 figure 1 before sarscov2 and sarscov cell entry their s protein is subjected to a priming process via serine protease tmprss2 in order permit the attachment of viral particles to ace2 and thus on cell surface 46 this entry mechanism is confirmed by the fact that tmprss2 inhibition or tmprss2ko mice show both decreased though not abolished s protein priming and reduced viral entry spread and inflammatory chemokine and cytokine release 46 47 sarscov2 is then internalized mainly by endocytosis in this process phosphatidylinositol 3phosphate 5kinase pikfyve two pore channel subtype 2 tpc2 and cathepsin l are critical for virus entry 48 sarscov binding also induces the releaseshedding of catalytically active ace2 ectodomains via adam17tace activity 49 50 51 52 in line inhibition of adam17tace blocks ace2 shedding and limits viral entry in both in vitro and in vivo 53 intriguingly recent data show that soluble ace2 sace2 could inhibit smediated infection in vitro although sace2 was not able to completely abrogate viral entry ace2 shedding may help in contrasting viral diffusion to different organs 54 conversely it has been demonstrated that ace2 downregulation following infection has a detrimental effect in the pathogenesis of ali 55 although this effect could be limited judging by the amount of ace2 expressed by the at2 cells of the lungs or the ratio between ace2 and circulating sace2 24 56 57 altogether these results suggest that ace2 might not be the only receptor for sarscov2 in fact recent structural and predictive studies proposed other receptormediated mechanisms for sarscov2 cell entry indicating three other aminopeptidases alanyl aminopeptidase anpep glutamyl aminopeptidase enpep and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 as the most probable additional receptors 58 59 it is known that the virus survival strategy is to elude and suppress host innate immune defences through gene deactivation or inhibition 57 60 61 in line huang et al demonstrated that sarscov nonstructural protein nsp1 binding to ribosomes inhibits host gene translation 62 more precisely a marked downregulation of ace2 mrna and protein expression was associated with the presence of sarscov and hcovnl63 another human coronavirus causing mild to severe respiratory tract infections excluding sars in target tissues 63 however whilst sarscov induced ace2 shedding from the cell surface hcovnl63 did not suggesting that ace2 shedding is directly related with prognostic severity 30 52 53 additionally a viral titre and infection timerelated sarscov effect on ace2 mrna has been shown where lower viral titre is associated with upregulation instead higher dosage and time after infection are correlated to reduced ace2 expression 64 last since interleukin il2 il7 il10 gcsf ip1 mcp1 mip1a and tnf are highly increased in patients with severe sarscov infection with respect to patients with mild symptoms it was hypothesized that ace2 suppression could result from a direct cell driven effect rather than virus mediated in line in vitro data could support a suppressive role for il7 and il2 on ace2 expression 64 part of the conundrum related to the role of ace2 in sarscov2 infection designated coronavirus disease19 or covid19 is related to the role exerted by this enzyme in ali indeed ali that can be caused by a number of aetiological agents eg influenza and coronaviruses bacterial pneumonia sepsis 65 cigarette smoking 66 particulate matter 67 and aspiration pneumonia 68 has been associated with the activation of the local ras 69 ang ii by acting on angii type 1 receptor at1r activates several signal transduction pathways including mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk and janusactivated kinase jak signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 stat3 phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pi3k promoting vascular permeability vasoconstriction myofibroblast smooth muscle cell and macrophage activation fibrosis and the expression of inflammatory cytokines 65 70 71 the latter effect has been mainly attributed to the ability of angii to activate the transcription factor nfb via at1r 72 angii may also bind to other receptors the most studied of which is type 2 receptor at2r however the net effect of at2r stimulation is less clear since both pro and antiinflammatory effects have been described 57 to corroborate the crucial role exerted by pulmonary ras on ali it was shown that angii levels are increased in animal models of ali 73 importantly recent reports on sarscov2infected patients showed a significant increase in ang ii plasma level that was inversely correlated with viral load 74 in line survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards have been associated with lower plasmatic ace levels in a preliminary report 75 moreover by evaluating the levels of angiotensinogen metabolites it was shown that ards outcome was associated with higher ang19ang110 and ang17ang110 ratios suggesting higher activity of both ace and ace2 in survivors 76 conversely at1r blockage resulted in the protection of animal models of lung injury 77 further an accumulating body of literature is showing the protective role exerted by ace2 on ali indeed ace2 knockout animals develop more severe forms of ali in response to a series of injurious stimuli 67 73 75 conversely the results of clinical trials that experimented the administration of soluble ace2 to treat patients suffering from ards although in early phase and not designed to test efficacy did not show very promising results 78 moreover as anticipated ace2 downregulation causes also accumulation of desarg9bk which interacts with type b1 bradykinin receptor possibly leading to the observed development of angioedema and coagulation cascade triggering 39 last the protective effect of ace2 may be also postulated considering both that ace2 levels decrease with age and that although children are vulnerable to the infection these patients are usually less severe 79 the relevance of myocardial involvement in sarscov2 infection is related to the high frequency of patients showing evidence of acute cardiac injury especially amongst those that necessitated icu care 80 this finding is similar to that observed in patients that succumbed to the sars crisis in toronto where the duration of disease was almost 10 times shorter in patients that showed cardiac involvement vs those that had no evidence of cardiac infection 30 in line a recent report suggests that the sarscov2 infection can be complicated by acute fulminant myocarditis 81 in this scenario left ventricular function completely recovered early after immunomodulation therapy 82 suggesting that organ damage in these patients is more the consequence of a cytokine storm than of an uncontrolled viral replication 80 82 83 to complete the picture the presence of viral particles infecting myocardial interstitial cells but neither endothelial cells nor myocytes was recently described to occur in one patient that died of covid19 with a clinical scenario characterized by respiratory distress hypotension and cardiogenic shock 84 consistently sarscov2infected patients were characterized by high amounts of plasmatic il1 ifn ip10 and mcp1 levels additionally more severe patients had higher concentrations of gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf strongly supporting the relevance of cytokines in dictating prognosis 80 this observation has stimulated early trials experimenting il6 axis inhibition in covid19 patients 82 cytokinemediated systemic response to infections can be associated with transient cardiac dilatation and dysfunction 85 however local viral replication could depress cardiac function too indeed sarscov can activate the nlrp3 inflammasome 86 thus promoting the release of il1 and possibly il18 a mediator known to cause systolic impairment 87 notably extrapulmonary multiorgan sarscov dissemination at the time of death was described in patients who died of sars during the toronto outbreak 88 and sarscov viral rna was detected in 3540 of cardiac autopsy samples 30 88 histology studies conducted on these hearts showed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy fibrosis and an inflammatory infiltrate mainly constituted by cd68 macrophages 30 however necropsy of 39yearold woman who died from sarscov with severe left ventricular dysfunction at echocardiographic evaluation has shown slight left ventricular enlargement without evidence of interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate or cardiomyocyte necrosis 89 importantly in one postmortem cardiac specimen of a 50yearold patient who died from sarscov2 infection only limited interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrates without significant injury were described 90 similar findings characterized by cd68 macrophage infiltrates showing evidence of a cytopathic effect were recently reported in a case report of a 69yearold patient that died from covid19 84 the paucity of lymphocyte infiltrate observed in these reports may be explained by the severe lymphopenia that accompanies covid19 80 the mechanism of negative effect on myocardial tissue of sarscov infection was hypothesized to be related to both ace2 downregulation and cytokine storm 63 82 as outlined above ace2 expression may be reduced both by the binding of sarscov to ace2 leading to the endocytosis of the latter 91 and as a result of the activation of adam17tace by sars spike protein known to cleave internalize and promote ace2 shedding in endothelial cells 49 downregulation of ace2 results in an unbalance between the detrimental action of angii and the cardioprotective effects of ang17 further more chronic negative consequences on the cardiovascular system might be related to ace2 downregulation via desarg9bk accumulation and its consequential increase in vascular permeability inflammation that leads to an increased atherosclerotic plaques formation 92 further adam17tace activation induced by the spike protein promotes tnf release thus increasing macrophage mobilization and activation 49 52 moreover sarscov nucleocapsid n protein potentiates tgfmediated fibrosis 93 on the basis of the increase of ace2 associated with aceisarbs treatment it has been speculated that these drugs might rise the chances of severe covid19 94 according to the last report 29th april 2020 from the italian istituto superiore di sanit 25452 patients positive to sarscov2 died the observed mortality was higher amongst males in all age groups and in patients with comorbidities in 923 of the total sample data regarding comorbidities were available 817 of the deceased patients had 2 or more comorbidities such as arterial hypertension 692 diabetes mellitus 318 and chd 282 similar data regarding comorbidities and gender differences in mortality were observed during china covid19 emergency 95 prior to hospitalization 24 of covid19positive deceased italian patients were on treatment with aceis and 16 were receiving arbs the gender difference in mortality could be related to the smoking prevalence and sexbased immunological differences moreover a recent study suggests that ace2 expression seems to be higher in women than men and to decrease with age 64 96 97 the more severe prognosis of patients of older age may also been related to distinct mechanisms such as the ageassociated decline in the molecular machinery involved in removing cytosolic dna 98 also patients with hypertension or diabetes show high rate of ace2 genetic polymorphism that could influence ace2 or ang17 levels in the human body 64 99 100 101 therefore a negative correlation between ace2 expression and mortality has been suggested 64 an enormous body of literature shows that aceisarbs should be given as early as possible to all patients with acute myocardial infarction in asymptomatic patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction as well in hypertensive or diabetic patients for their important benefits for patient survival conversely an abrupt discontinuation of aceis in survivors of myocardial infarction on longterm treatment 102 103 or in patients with heart failure 104 can be potentially harmful further at the time of this pandemic covid19 there are no experimental or strong clinical data to contraindicate this therapy whilst on the contrary some are supporting the opposite 105 106 calcium channel blockers were suggested as alternative treatment for aceis and arbs 107 however since the development and progression of the remodelling process after an myocardial infarction in setting of heart failure hypertension or diabetes mellitus depends on neurohormonal activation only medications which block the effect of neurohormones 108 have demonstrated to reduce morbidity and mortality of patients for calcium channel blockers in spite of their beneficial hemodynamic activities there is no evidence supporting their ability to exert favourable effect early after an acute myocardial infarction on preventing heart failure in diabetics with hypertension and on general mortality reduction 18 109 110 lastly calcium channel blockers have a strong interaction with antiviral drugs lopinavirritonavir used to treat covid19 patients in a recent retrospective observational study from wuhan including 188 hypertensive subjects affected by covid19 treatment aceisarbs was associated with lower allcause mortality 105 furthermore a large populationbased casecontrol study performed in lombardy during the ongoing covid19 epidemic spread on more than 6000 covid19 patients did not show evidence that the use of either arbs or aceis affects the risk of covid19 infection 111 italian regulatory agency aifa recommended on 17 march 2020 do not to modify the therapy in progress with antihypertensives whatever the therapeutic class in wellcontrolled hypertensive patients as they expose frail patients to potential new side effects or an increase in risk of adverse cardiovascular events does not appear justified for the same reasons compared to the hypothesis of using ace inhibitors and sartans also in healthy people for prophylactic purposes remembered that these drugs should be used exclusively for the treatment of pathologies for which there are approved 112 as depicted in figure 1 the interaction between sarscov2 and the host cell promotes a series of complex alterations leading to both the downregulation of ace2 expression and the increased production and release of inflammatory cytokines the net loss of the ace2ang17 antiinflammatory properties along with a dysregulated vascular permeability ace2desarg9bk mediated and the proinflammatory properties of secreted cytokines may be therefore responsible for a large part of the detrimental effects caused by covid19 taking into account the evidences presented in this review and at present there are no data demonstrating adverse outcomes amongst covid19 patients in therapy with acearbs on the contrary it seems that the treatment discontinuation could have plausible negative effects thus according with the recommendations of the main cardiovascular international 113 114 and italian scientific societies 115 116 patients chronically taking aceiarbs who contract covid19 infection should not discontinue the treatment neither temporarily figure 2 further researches are needed to indagate some uncleared and controversial aspects of the pandemics

2
 yan et al reported that the trimer of the spike glycoprotein on the virion surface docking onto the angiotensinconverting enzyme ace 2 dimer structure is an essential step in the attack by sarscov2 on human cells and leads to systemic organ injury3 4 this sarscov2ace2 interaction has generated great interest in the development of reninangiotensin system rasbased therapeutic strategies for covid19
5

 the ras a key hormone system regulates blood pressure fluid and electrolyte balance and systemic vascular function particularly in maintaining plasma sodium concentration arterial blood pressure and extracellular volume
6
 in most organs ras activation can result in hypertension inflammation cell proliferation and fibrosis6 7 manipulating the ras by stabilizing renin and angiotensin ii ang ii levels and promoting ace2 expression can prevent numerous chronic and acute diseases7 8 9 10 the ras signal transduction system is regulated by two main axes a aceang iiang ii type 1 receptor at1r axis which promotes vasoconstriction hypertension inflammation fibrosis and proliferation and b ace2ang 17mas axis which induces the opposite effects of aceang iiat1r axis activation to inhibit any detrimental consequences figure 1 several studies have indicated that circulating ang ii levels are significantly higher in individuals infected with sarscov2 than in healthy individuals thus sarscov2 infection must cause tissue ace2 downregulation with systemic ras imbalance and thus promote multiorgan damage1 11 12 sars coronavirus sarscov interacts with ace2 via trimers of the sars spike protein a loop of which extends into a hydrophobic pocket of ace2 in addition the difference between sarscov and sarscov2 is of only 380 amino acid substitutions translating to differences only in five of the six important amino acids in the receptorbinding domain rbd of the viral spike protein both sarscov2 and sarscov infect cells via viral spike proteinhost ace2 receptor contact however the rbd has significantly higher binding affinity to ace2 receptors in sarscov2 than in sarscov1 13 furthermore the entry of sarscov2 into host cells induces ace2 internalization and shedding which increases ang ii and reduces ang 17 levels with a net increase in proinflammatory function relative to the antiinflammatory function of ras
14

 ras activation induced by chronic inflammation stimulates proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokine production in immune cells which in turn upregulates the expression of ras components and accelerates the formation of systemic and local ang ii
15
 blood ang ii levels are elevated in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension diabetes and obesity16 17 18 moreover elevated plasma ang ii levels are correlated with shortened survival in patients with cancer cachexia
19
 in addition senescent t cells are more sensitive to ang ii stimulation and have adverse effects on the target organ in which senescent tcellderived ifn may play a key role
20
 these findings indicate that chronic inflammation and aging have complex but close relationship with activation of the aceang iiat1r axis patients with covid19 develop acute inflammatory diseases such as sarscov2induced acute respiratory distress syndrome these patients particularly those aged 65 years or with hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease chronic respiratory disease low immune status cancer or obesity have poor prognosis and may develop multiple organ failure21 22 23 24 furthermore increased levels of obesityrelated inflammatory cytokines possibly increase covid19 morbidity
25
 finally patients with cancer might have an increased covid19 risk because they generally have systemic immunosuppression due to the malignancy and the administered anticancer treatments
26

 a recent cohort study on 45 000 confirmed cases in china reported a considerably increased mortality rate in patients with covid19 who had cardiovascular disease 105 diabetes 73 or hypertension 63 compared with those who did not have these comorbidities 0927 28 in addition an analysis of the medical records of 355 patients who died due to covid19 in italy revealed that only 08 of these patients had no comorbidities
29
 moreover of all 355 patients approximately half had at least three comorbidities approximately onequarter had two comorbidities and approximately onequarter had one comorbidity
29
 moreover approximately 738 had hypertension approximately 339 had diabetes and approximately 301 had heart disease29 30
 therefore we hypothesize that the higher mortality rate in patients with covid19 who have comorbidities may be attributable to the two hits to the ras the first hit originates from chronic inflammation which activates the aceang iiat1r axis of the ras and the second hit originates from sarscov2 infection which inhibits the ace2ang 17mas axis of the ras these two hits increase tissue damage and multiple organ failure risks in patients with sarscov2 infection figure 2 the lung is the primary target for sarscov2 infection mainly because of its large surface area and high ace2 expression in alveolar epithelial type ii cells in addition to being highly expressed in the lungs ace2 is highly expressed in tissues such as the heart kidney endothelial and intestinal tissues which might explain the multiple organ dysfunction noted in patients with covid19
31
 one study indicated low covid19 severity in patients with hypertension receiving ace inhibitors acei or angiotensinreceptor blockers arb moreover these patients tended to have low blood interleukin 6 levels
32
 compared with other antihypertensive drugs acei or arb use has also been reported to increase blood cd3 and cd8 tcell counts and reduce peak viral load
32
 finally ace2 activation can reduce the severity of lipopolysaccharideinduced acute lung injury via the activated serinethreonine protein kinase ampkmammalian targetofrapamycin mtor pathway
33

 regulation of the ras may serve as a therapeutic target for covid19 treatment and therefore the underlying mechanism of its effects requires urgent clarification the authors declare no potential conflict of interest  the pivotal link between ace2 deficiency and sars-cov-2 infection paolo verdecchia claudio cavallini antonio spanevello fabio angeli   according to the center for systems science and engineering at the johns hopkins university as of april 12 2020 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 pandemic caused 108867 deaths worldwide with a total of 1777666 infected people httpscoronavirusjhuedumaphtml just to make a comparison the sars-cov virus in years 2002-2003 infested about 8500 people in 27 countries and caused 866 deaths 1
 the tremendous impact of sars-cov-2 infection and the paucity or lack of established therapeutic measures is generating basic and clinical studies to explore the mechanisms of viral entry into the human body and the subsequent pathophysiological and therapeutic implications the present review discusses the role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors which are not only the door through which the virus enters into cells 23 but also the conductor of several pathophysiological reactions associated with the clinical features of the disease with potential therapeutic implications the entry of sars-cov-2 into cells is mediated by the efficient binding of the spike s viral protein a 1273 amino acid long protein which belongs to the viral envelope and protrudes outwards with a corona like appearance to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors 23
 the ace2 receptor discovered by two independent groups in year 2000 45 is a trans-membrane type i glycoprotein mono-carboxypeptidase composed by 805 amino acids which uses a single extracellular catalytic domain to remove one single amino acid from the octapeptide angiotensin ii to generate angiotensin1-7 ace2 receptor also converts angiotensin i into angiotensin1-9 which in turn is converted to angiotensin1-7 by ace and neprilisin figure 1
 the catalytic efficiency of ace2 is 400 times higher on angiotensin ii than on angiotensin i 6 ace2 shows a 40 structural identity to ace 4 although ace-inhibitors do not block ace2 because of the different conformational structure of the catalytic site 4
 ace2 mediates the cell entry of three strains of coronavirus sars-cov nl63 and sars-cov-2 7 notably sars-cov and sars-cov2 share a 76 identity in the amino acid sequence 8 thereby explaining the propensity of these viruses for binding with ace2 some structural variations of human ace2 have been identified that are characterized by a lower binding affinity with the spike viral protein with potential protective implications 9 the first step of viral entry process is the binding of the n-terminal portion of the viral protein unit s1 to a pocket of the ace2 receptor the second step which is believed to be of utmost importance for viral entry is the protein cleavage between the s1 and s2 units which is operated by the receptor transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 a member of the hepsintmprss subfamily 10 tmprss2 is stechiometrically contiguous to ace2 receptor 10 the cleavage of the viral protein by tmprss2 is a crucial step because after s1 detachment the remaining viral s2unit undergoes a conformational rearrangement which drives and completes the fusion between the viral and cellular membrane with subsequent entry of the virus into cell release of its content replication and infection of other cells the importance of tmpsrr2 is supported by the evidence that entry of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 into cells is partially blocked by camostat mesylate an inhibitor of tmpsrr2 2
 ace2 genes map to the x chromosome 11 its expression seems to be higher in asian than in white and african-american people 12 and receptors are ubiquitous in particular ace2 receptors are expressed in the heart endothelium of coronary arteries myocites fibroblasts epicardial adipocites vessels vascular endothelial and smooth cells gut intestinal epithelial cells lung tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells type 2 pneumocytes macrophages kidney luminal surface of tubular epithelial cells testis brain 13 14 15 16 in the lung the wide surface of alveolar epithelial cells might explain the vulnerability of this organ to the consequences of virus invasion ace2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form the disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 adam17 upregulated by angiotensin ii through its type 1 receptors at1 receptors cleaves the membrane-anchored ace2 thereby releasing a circulating active form of ace2 with loss of the catalytically activity of the remaining part of the enzyme anchored to membrane 17 elevated circulating levels of soluble ace2 are markers of different disease states characterized by increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system and associated with a worse prognosis 1819
 studies addressing the pulmonary effects of angiotensin1-7 appear particularly appealing mas receptors are expressed at the surface of bronchial smooth muscle cells and alveolar epithelium 2930 in experimental and clinical models of lung inflammation angiotensin1-7 exerted anti-inflammatory effects with less infiltrates of lymphocytes and neutrophils reduced perivascular and peri-bronchial inflammation and prevention of subsequent fibrosis 2931 32 33
 ace2 is expressed on the luminal side of the bronchial ciliated epithelia where it removes a single amino acid residue also from the polypeptide des-arg 9 bradykinin dabk 6 thereby preventing the binding of dabk on the bradykinin receptor b1 receptor 34 in the presence of reduced ace2 function in the lung induced by endotoxins there is an increase of free dabk which in turn activates b1 receptors with release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and intense lung inflammatory and injury 34
 the ace2angiotensin1-7mas receptor axis exerts anti-thrombotic effects 35 36 37 38 mas receptors are expressed on platelets 39 stimulation of mas receptors by angiotensin1-7 increases prostacyclin and no release 3536 animals knockout for mas receptors have a shorter bleeding time and increased size of thrombi 36 in these animals administration of angiotensin1-7 induces a marked antithrombotic effect which is directly related to the plasma levels of angiotensin1-7
39 and is inhibited by a-779 an antagonist of mas receptors 35 thus angiotensin1-7 plays an important role in opposing the pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory effects of angiotensin ii 4041
 the ace2angiotensin1-7mas receptor axis is well expressed in the pancreas where it improves insulin secretion possibly by improving peri-insular blood flow and inhibiting fibrosis as a result of increased no release 2842 ace2 receptors are also expressed in the adipose tissue 4344 and a reduction of ace2 has been noted in the adipose tissue of obese animals 44 in animal experiments diets rich of fats decreased ace2 activity and angiotensin1-7 and increased angiotensin ii and blood pressure levels in male but not in female animals and these reactions were inhibited by at1 blockade with losartan 45 after ovariectomy female animals showed similar reactions as in males 45 these data suggest that ace2 deficiency may favor obesity-induced hypertension 45 ace2 is also expressed in the cardiac adipocytes 46 obese patients with heart failure have an increased amount of epicardial adipose tissue 46 and it has been suggested that ace2 deficiency can induce heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in animals 47 this phenomenon has been attributed to adipose tissue inflammation through local activation of macrophages which possess at1 receptors on their cellular membrane 26
 since the pulmonary inflammation and the resulting acute respiratory distress syndrome ards are potentially deadly complications of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 studies addressing the lung complications of ace2 down-regulation are of outmost importance studies using different models of lung injury showed that the down-regulation of ace2 receptors triggers important inflammatory lesions in the respiratory tree alveolar wall thickening edema infiltrates of inflammatory cells bleeding which appear to be mediated by angiotensin ii 2248 49 50
 tracheal instillation of cigarette smoke 49 or particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter of less than 25 m 50 induces acute lung injury with release of inflammatory cytokines il-6 tnf- and tgf-1 and increased expression of ace consistent with aceangiotensin iiat1 receptor axis over-activity 50 these reactions are increased in ace2 knockout mice 50 in a model of acid aspiration which induces acute lung injury lung inflammatory lesions were more severe and lethal in ace2 knock-out animals 48 in these animals injection of recombinant ace2 as well as at1 receptor blockers attenuate the degree of lung injury 48 these findings strongly suggest that ace2 protects from lung injury induced by acid aspiration 48
 notably lung injury has been induced by the isolated spike viral protein of the sars-cov the ligand for ace2 binding in the absence of other viral components 22 this model has the merit to investigate the impact of ace2 down-regulation in the absence of confounding effects of viral invasion and replication the authors found that even the isolated spike viral protein induced down-regulation of ace2 receptors with concomitant increase of angiotensin ii in the lung tissue and precipitation of severe pulmonary inflammatory lesions 22 also in this model at1 receptor blockers attenuated the pulmonary lesions induced by the spike viral protein 22
 a key point to remark is that ace2 are mainly expressed in pneumocytes type ii small cylindrical cells which represent 5 of all pneumocytes 51 pneumocytes type 2 are responsible for the production of alveolar surfactant and in the same time they function as stem cells progenitors of pneumocytes type i 95 of all pneumocytes which are responsible of gas exchanges 52 therefore the damage of pneumocytes type ii due to the binding of coronavirus to ace2 receptors is devastating for at least three reasons 1 local unopposed aceangiotensin iiat1 receptor axis over-activity 2 reduced production of alveolar surfactant by injured pneumocytes type ii leading to reduced lung elasticity 3 reduced repair of pneumocytes type i leading to impaired gas exchanges and fibrosis 53
 studies from china and italy have shown that hypertension diabetes and history of cardiovascular disease are the most frequent comorbidities in patients infected with sars-cov-2 54 55 56 older age and male sex are two additional factors associated with sars-cov-2 infection 54 55 56 a similar picture emerged a few years ago with the sars-cov infection 5758
 in a study conducted in 201 patients infected with sars-cov-2 most patients were men 637 of patients the mean age was 51 years and the most frequent comorbidities were hypertension 194 diabetes 109 and history of cardiovascular disease 40 55 notably the patients who developed ards were older and had a higher prevalence of hypertension 274 vs 137 diabetes 190 vs 51 when compared with those who did not develop ards 55 in a multivariate analysis the factors associated with progression from ards syndrome to death included older age neutrophilia and hyper-coagulation mainly reflected by a higher d-dimer 55 abnormal coagulation parameters and enhanced thrombosis predict a poor prognosis in patients with sars-cov-2 59 a meta-analysis of 8 studies conducted in china on a total of 46248 patients infected with sars-cov2 confirmed that hypertension diabetes and history of cardiovascular disease were the most frequent comorbidities in these patients 56 again hypertension and history of cardiovascular disease were significantly more prevalent among the more severe patients 56
 in a recent analysis of 1591 infected patients from italy the mean age of patients was 63 years men were 82 and the prevalence of patients with hypertension diabetes and previous cardiovascular disease was 49 17 and 21 respectively 54 patients with hypertension were older that those without hypertension 66 vs 62 years p0005 when comparing the patients who died in the intensive care unit with those who survived the former were older and had a higher prevalence of hypertension 63 vs 40 p0001 54
 it is interesting to note that several conditions associated with viral infection and severity of the disease share a variable degree of ace2 deficiency for example ace2 expression in the lungs markedly decreases with ageing 60 to a greater extent in men than women 60 diabetes mellitus has been associated with reduced ace2 expression possibly as effect of glycosylation 61 62 63 several experimental and clinical studies indicate that ace2 deficiency obtained through deletion or inhibition may be a causative factor for hypertension 1464 treatment with soluble recombinant ace2 reduces the blood pressure rise provoked by angiotensin ii increases angiotensin1-7 and reduces angiotensin ii 65 ace2 deficiency has been associated with exacerbation of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy induced by angiotensin ii 66 and maladaptive left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction 67 furthermore deficiency of ace2 enhances the susceptibility to heart failure 14 a heterozygote loss of ace2 is believed sufficient to increase the susceptibility to heart disease 68
 given the above premises it is tempting to speculate figure 2
 that ace2 deficiency may play a central role in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 infection the down-regulation of ace2 induced by viral invasion could be especially detrimental in individuals with baseline ace2 deficiency due for example to older age diabetes hypertension and prior heart diseases including heart failure the possibility that a mild or moderate ace2 deficiency may protect from viral invasion seems unlikely because of the intrinsically high affinity of sars-cov-2 to ace2 receptors 23 by contrast in a setting of ace2 deficiency the ace2 down-regulation induced by virus could amplify the imbalance between the aceangiotensin iiat1 receptor axis adverse and the ace2angiotensin1-7imas receptor axis protective at lung level such dysregulation would much facilitate the progression of inflammatory and hyper-coagulation processes which share dependency upon local angiotensin ii hyper-activity insufficiently opposed by angiotensin1-7 this chain of events would not deny the concomitant role of other mechanisms including an impaired immune response to initial viral invasion or a genetic susceptibility to hyper-inflammation and thrombosis 6970
 in this context administration of soluble recombinant ace2 12 or angiotensin1-7
71 could be promising therapeutic approaches requiring urgent evaluation in clinical trials two trials of losartan as additional treatment for sars-cov-2 infection in hospitalized nct04312009 or not hospitalized nct04311177 patients have been announced supported by the background of the huge adverse impact of the aceangiotensin iiat1 receptor axis over-activity in these patients the possibility that ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs may be discontinued even temporarily because these drugs appear to increase the expression of ace2 receptors the site of viral entry into the human organism 72 73 74 75 is actively debated 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 several scientific societies and various experts in this area expressed the position that discontinuation of these drugs is not justified by evidence and could be dangerous 76778182 on the other hand several experimental data discussed above suggest the potential utility of arbs particularly to limit lung inflammation during viral invasion 8083 it is hoped that the results of the above mentioned nct04312009 and nct04311177 trials will answer this question we suggest that ace2 down-regulation induced by the cell entry of sars-cov nl63 and sars-cov-2 may be particularly detrimental in subjects with pre-existing ace2 deficiency some degree of ace2 deficiency has been associated with a variety of conditions including older age hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease which also characterize people more likely to be infected and to present more severe complications in a setting of enhanced ace2 deficiency produced by the viral invasion the marked dysregulation between the adverse aceangiotensin iiat1 axis and the protective ace2angiotensin1-7mas axis would contribute to enhance the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes these considerations provide a rationale for investigating the role of therapeutic approaches conceptually linked to ace2 receptor activity these include the use of soluble recombinant ace2 angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin ii type 1 receptor blockers which are currently being evaluated study supported in part by the no-profit fondazione umbra cuore e ipertensione-onlus perugia italy none the authors declare they have no conflict of interest  the covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the cardio-oncology population ishan asokan soniya rabadia v eric yang h   the spread of novel coronavirus 2019-ncov covid-19 shook the world with its highly virulent transmissibility manifesting largely as a severe acute respiratory syndrome with more than 43 million people confirmed to be infectedwith approximately 13 million cases in the usaand over 294000 deaths worldwide at the time of this writing 1 originating in china the covid-19 epidemic has surpassed its predecessors in the number of hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions required to handle an infectious process within a short period of time and of such grand scale 2 the early sars epidemic that emerged in 2002 similarly involved human-to-human transmission with animal vectors linked to outbreaks and confirmed in laboratory isolates 3 initially described as pneumonia of unknown origin covid-19 is believed to be linked to bats based on its genomic similarity to known bat coronavirus batcov ratg13 4 though most coronaviruses are mild two beta-coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov also took place within the last two decades 5 these two unique predecessors preceded the pandemic that began in china in 2019 the virus originating in wuhan hubei province china in late december resulted in nearly 96000 cases initially and is now considered a worldwide pandemic 6 routes of transmission of the virus have been documented to include respiratory droplets contact fomites and fecal-oral transmission 7 8 the most common symptoms at onset of illness include fever cough myalgia and fatigue with rare complaints of sputum production headache hemoptysis loss of taste andor smell and diarrhea in addition to clinical characteristics patients showcased ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography scans however more than half of the patients in early studies notably developed dyspnea that correlated with patchy infiltrates on chest radiographs the mean duration of symptoms was roughly 8 days with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards occurring between days 8 and 14 9 patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the wuhan cohort typically required icu admission of up to 12 weeks following symptom development which foreshadowed the scale of the pandemic and mirrored data obtained from the mers epidemic in 2015 10 11 epidemiological data from china confirmed the median age of the patients impacted by the disease to be 59 years with disease distribution disproportionately impacting males 12 the data further hypothesized that children might be less likely to become infected or if infected demonstrated far milder symptoms italy documented nearly 22512 cases by march of 2020 with the largest proportion of cases and fatalities impacting males greater than 60 years of age 13 in the lombardy study 68 of patients had at least one existing comorbidity with hypertension being most frequently cited other predisposing factors included cardiovascular disease and hypercholesterolemia a rare subset had pre-existing lung disease manifesting as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease roughly 11 of the lombardy patients were managed with non-invasive ventilatory support 14 the need for invasive ventilatory support varied across regions of the world and some of the wuhan cohort were directly transitioned to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo for resuscitation purposes 10 underlying risk factors such as hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease and immunosuppression have been explored as prognosticators regarding clinical outcomes of covid-19 infections in hospitalized patients 15 however the impact of the pandemic in patients with a history of cancer and pre-existing andor cancer treatmentassociated cardiovascular diseasethe cardio-oncology patientis unknown theoretically this population is likely at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from covid-19 infection and has unique healthcare needs that put them at higher risk at exposure from community and healthcare-related transmission examples of these risks include needing ongoing cancer treatments in the outpatient and inpatient setting as well as imaging-related procedures and operations for cancer-related staging and treatments if these patients also have pre-existing cardiovascular disease andor acquired cardiotoxicity during and after treatments they also warrant additional evaluation finally there appears to be a strong correlation with worse outcomes in hospitalized covid-19 patients in cardiovascular andor cancer-related comorbidities which will be reviewed below a meta-analysis of 6 chinese studies evaluating 1527 affected patients showed that the most prevalent cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities included hypertension 171 cardiac andor cerebrovascular disease 164 and diabetes 97 most importantly patients with hypertension and cardiac andor cerebrovascular disease significantly accounted for more icu cases compared with non-icu cases with prevalence of 288 rr 203 for hypertension and 167 rr 330 for cardiac andor cerebrovascular disease 18 data from the world health organization and chinese center for disease control and prevention confirm that patients with comorbidities have a higher case fatality rate cfr than those without comorbidities 19 20 of the 55924 laboratory-confirmed cases in china there was a 38 cfr and higher rates were seen with those with cvd 132 diabetes 92 and hypertension 84 19 a cohort study of 201 patients from wuhan jinyintan hospital showed that hypertension was significantly associated with patients progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 274 vs 137 p  002 and later death 364 vs 175 p  005 21 as of march 17 2020 the cfr in italy is 72 from a total of 22512 cases of which a detailed chart review of a subsample of 355 deceased patients found high underlying disease prevalence of ischemic heart disease 30 diabetes 355 atrial fibrillation 245 and cancer 203 22 a case series of patients with covid-19 in the icus in the lombardy region demonstrated that hypertension was the most common comorbidity 49 and cardiovascular disease 21 was the second furthermore there was a statistically significant higher prevalence of hypertension among patients who died compared with those who were discharged from the icu 63 vs 40 p  0001 14 while epidemiologic data in the usa remains dynamic with limited studies to date in major urban centers a report of 167 confirmed cases linked to a long-term facility in washington state also conferred similar findings showing high underlying disease prevalence with hypertension 443 cardiac disease 407 and diabetes 228 23 a large new york study examined a total of 5700 patients with median age being 63 years age the new york cohort found hypertension in 566 patients obesity in 417 patients and diabetes in 338 of patients of the patients who died those with diabetes were more likely to have been mechanically ventilated or be hospitalized in the icu 15 another case series of 393 patients admitted to new york hospitals found that 501 of patients had hypertension and 21 had cardiovascular disease 24 not all studies detailed specifics of what defined cardiac disease therefore it is difficult to delineate covid-19 direct associations with coronary artery disease cardiomyopathy or heart failure from a large sample size standpoint however a case series from seattle washington did state that 429 of the 21 critically ill patients with covid-19 had underlying congestive heart failure 25 in addition to underlying cvd being a risk factor for contracting covid-19 patients that develop acute myocardial injury have worse outcomes even in those without baseline cardiovascular dysfunction 2528 acute myocardial injury can be categorized in three varieties elevated troponin levels above the 99th percentile upper reference limit development of new or worsening heart failure and myocarditis several studies from china found that elevated troponin levels were significantly associated with higher mortality 2628 a case series of 187 patients at the seventh hospital of wuhan city china found that patients with elevated troponin t tnt levels had a significantly higher mortality rate to those with normal tnt levels 596 vs 89 p  0001 patients with underlying cvd including those with underlying hypertension coronary heart disease and cardiomyopathy were more likely to have elevated tnt levels during their hospital course 26 lipid metabolism is also observed to be dysregulated in patients with sars-cov infection serum concentrations of free fatty acids lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol remained elevated and contributed to chronic cardiovascular damage post infection in patients with sars-cov 29 long-term cardiovascular and atherosclerotic changes in patients who suffer from covid-19 have not been documented yet given the recent nature of this pandemic a case series of 21 critically ill covid-19 patients from seattle also found that one-third of their patients developed new cardiomyopathy with cardiogenic shock in the absence of prior systolic dysfunction during the progression of their illness 25 it is unclear if these patients that developed cardiomyopathy truly had myocarditis or had underlying cvd that predisposed them to this clinical course however covid-19 has been shown to directly cause myocarditis in otherwise healthy individuals in several case reports 30 31 thus covid-19 demonstrates various patterns of myocardial injury with higher mortality risk being associated with elevated troponin levels in addition in the cardio-oncology population elevated cardiac biomarkers can pose an additional layer of complexity and challenge when dealing with management abnormal elevations of troponin and bnp biomarkers can be indicative of cardiotoxicity from cancer physiology or from the treatments themselves 32 some elevations may be non-specific and are reflective of subclinical cardiotoxicity in patients receiving anthracyclines andor anti-her2 agents in which stable patients can be medically managed 33 34 however some patients receiving other agents such as certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors with prothrombotic risk ie ponatinib or fluoropyridines ie 5-fluorouracil may suffer cardiotoxicity in the form of coronary ischemiavasospasm which may warrant more invasive diagnostictreatment strategies 3537 elevated cardiac biomarkers have also been associated with worse outcomes and or cardiac hemodynamic instability including cytokine release syndrome from chimeric antigen therapy car-t heart failure from proteasome inhibitor use ie carfilzomib or myocarditis from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy 3841 some of these disease processes may confound treatment of a cancer patient also afflicted with covid-19 and thus multidisciplinary assessment particularly by a cardio-oncologist may be essential to provide optimal care in this high-risk population cancer patients have shown to be at higher risk for contracting the virus likely from their immune dysregulation in setting of their malignancy and various treatments and remain at high risk for sustaining severe outcomes 19 42 per the who joint mission report the cfr for cancer patients 76 was higher than the overall cfr for 55924 covid-19 patients in china 19 reports from italy and washington also support that cancer patients had similar findings 14 22 23 however the specific type of cancer was neither reported in these studies nor linked to specific outcome several studies have indicated that cancer patients trend toward having more severe disease a case series of patients admitted to new york hospitals identified that 59 patients had cancer and 43 of these patients required invasive ventilation for support 24 a prospective cohort study of following 1590 covid-19 patients in china demonstrated that of the 18 patients with cancer lung cancer was the most frequently incurred malignancy moreover in this cohort history of cancer was associated with a higher risk of severe events icu admission requiring ventilation or death and faster progression to severe events median time for cancer patients 13 days vs 43 days for non-cancer patients those with a history of chemotherapy or surgery in the past month had a higher risk for severe events even when adjusted for other risk factors including age or 534 95 ci 1801618 p  0005 of the 18 described in the wuhan group roughly 10 received chemotherapy and 71 targeted therapy however age alone was also an independent risk factor for severe events in the cancer group of patients those with history of lung cancer versus other cancer types did not predict a more severe outcome 42 another study from china evaluating all cancer patients admitted to zhongnan hospital of wuhan university determined that cancer patients had a 079 infection rate compared with the overall citys 037 infection rate a total of 12 patients were affected 583 had non-small cell lung carcinoma nsclc with approximately 417 were undergoing treatment with chemotherapy and resulting mortality rate as of march 10 2020 being 25 additionally nsclc patients that were greater than age 60 had a higher incidence of covid-19 compared with younger patients with nsclc 43 these findings are further corroborated by a study that examined all 28 cancer patients admitted to 3 hospitals in china lung cancer was the most common cancer type among these patients 25 diabetes 143 and chronic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease 143 were the most common comorbidities listed clinical factors that significantly predicted worse outcomes in this group of patients included age patchy consolidation on imaging and receipt of anti-tumor treatment in the last 14 days 44 these studies suggest that patients with cancer are at higher risk for covid-19 and those with older age and cancer are at an even higher risk for poor outcomes lung cancer has been reported to be more common in these studies but the total sample size of cancer patients remains too low to draw any meaningful conclusions on which malignancy may be most associated with severity of covid-19 infections lastly although having recent anti-cancer treatment increases the risk for severe outcomes it is unclear which anti-cancer agents are associated with higher risk for acquiring covid-19 infection severity of infection andor mortality table 1 demonstrates a literature review of studies published until april 26 2020 that identify the prevalence of cancer among covid-19 infected patients although no formal studies have assessed the direct impact of covid-19 on cardio-oncology patients a study has shown that both cvd patients and cancer patients do have an increased risk for cardiac injury which in of itself is an independent predictor of mortality 28 additionally since the data suggests that cvd and cancer are potentially independent risk factors for virus acquisition and severe outcomes it is reasonable to assume that if patients have both risk factors then they may posit higher cumulative risk there is also concern that cancer treatments may induce disease states such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseaseboth frequently associated risk factors for worse outcomes in covid-19 patients 19 an example of such a clinical scenario could involve metastatic renal carcinoma patients who develop hypertension from anti-vegf tyrosine kinase therapy or cardiomyopathy from anti-her2 and anthracycline therapy of breast cancer 45 46 however the definition of cardiovascular disease that patients have been classified with in these studies is not always clearly delineated thus risk stratification of these patients in regard to covid-19 risk requires more refined investigation and long-term follow-up regarding outcomes the elevated risk that cancer patients face during the covid-19 pandemic poses many challenges some of these include providing ongoing cancer treatments especially if patients are undergoing curative therapy enrolling patients into experimental drug trials continuing close cardiotoxicity surveillance and providing treatments to patients who have an optimal window of adequate functional status 47 48 given concerns for hospital-acquired covid-19 infections this additional risk factor can impact continuation of therapy or initiation of regimens for aggressive malignancy that require hospitalization for closer monitoring 43 47 48 moreover patients that may rely on drugs or stem cell donations for treatment may necessitate access to unique global sources and are rendered at a disadvantage due to travel restrictions and quarantine policies 49 in response to these climactic changes the national comprehensive cancer network and national cancer institute have provided guidance to providers on providing care to oncology patients resource allocation and managing drug trials 50 as referenced above a unique source of transmission in the cardio-oncology population is healthcare exposure healthcare-related exposure is being given greater importance as an attributable vector past experience with sars-cov demonstrated that the virus can be transmitted via aerosolizing procedures such as endotracheal intubation placing anesthesiologists at great risk for acquiring the infection 51 52 during the outbreak of covid-19 implementation of infection control and establishment of safe personal protective equipment ppe remained and remains key intense aerosolizing procedures such as emergent intubations cardiopulmonary resuscitation or bronchoscopies should require stringent ppe to maintain adequate protection despite attempting to roll out these precautions review of the who-china joint mission on covid confirmed that nearly 3387 healthcare workers tested positive for covid-19 infection resulting in 22 deaths 53 while initial understanding of the pathogen remained poor long-time exposure to large-scale infected patients directly increased the risk of infection for healthcare workers and risk of being an asymptomatic carrier 54 fatigue lack of available healthcare workers limited resources and intensity of response led to several healthcare workers succumbing to infection though unsettling it is doubly important to place value on healthcare-related exposure as an established risk factor when dealing with cancer patients with pre-existing risk factors coronaviruses are a large collection of single-stranded enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses that fall within the family of coronaviridae and the order nidovirales 55 six specific coronaviruses have been identified as human-susceptible among which alpha and beta subsets demonstrated lower pathogenicity and caused milder respiratory symptoms respectively genomic analysis of sars-cov-2 showcased 962 shared sequencing with bat cov ratg13 thus positing that the bat variant served as the natural host of the virus 4 however the severe acute syndromes belong to the b-genus with envelope-anchored spike protein mediating viral entry into host cells by first binding to a host receptor and subsequently fusing membranes 56 the covid-19 infection has a well-defined capsular structure with 14 binding residues with 8 conserved from prior sars-cov infections the viral genome contains several open reading frames with majority of the viral rna-encoding non-structural proteins nsps that play a role in the pathogenesis of disease recent research studies focusing on nsp2 and nsp3 demonstrated an in vivo role that these subunits may play in infectious capability and differentiation of covid-19 57 mechanistically covid-19 is found to be linked to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 a membrane-bound aminopeptidase highly expressed in lung intestinal and heart tissue beyond being implicated in hypertension and diabetes ace-2 further functions as a receptor for coronaviruses 58 covid-19 translocates into lung parenchyma via damaging epithelial cells resulting in respiratory symptoms with symptom severity worsening in patients with cardiovascular disease ace2 secretion is noted to be elevated in cvd patients due to increased reliance on angiotensin-receptor blockers for management of hypertension at the receptor level the receptor-binding domain of sars-cov spike protein specifically recognizes ace2 which contributes to both cross-species and human-to-human transmission 59 60 documented variability is demonstrated between various strains of sars-cov in terms of binding affinity and viral attachment which is preserved across both humans and animal models of disease transmission 61 the preserved domains across merssars may contribute to the heightened inflammatory response and cytokine milieu that leads to severe pneumonia 62 on a molecular level specific associations and descriptive characteristics of the patients identified cytokine abnormalities in icu-level patients versus non-iculevel admissions compared with non-icu patients icu patients had higher plasma levels of il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a and tnf-a 63 though this cytokine thumbprint is being linked to covid-19 infection ards similarly showcases elevations in inflammatory markers questioning origin and role of virally mediated hyperinflammation 64 multiple treatments are being assessed in various trials including antivirals anti-inflammatories immunotherapies and cardiovascular medications for the treatment of covid-19 although some these therapies have potential to provide benefit there are numerous potential cardiac toxicities and drug-drug interactions that may be harmful to cardio-oncology patients which is critically relevant since a high percentage of covid-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities 6568 an appraisal of these agents and their potential cardiotoxicitiesof which there is no current proven efficacy at this timeis beyond the scope of this review however some agents are actively used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease andor cancer-related conditions and the unique disease states of the cardio-oncology population may yield insights into the mechanisms of covid-19 pathophysiology for instance the idea of using medications that have already been well-studied and target host responses by boosting host immunity was in discussion during prior significant outbreaks and epidemics including ebola and influenza 69 70 ace inhibitors acei angiotensin-receptor blockers arb and statins are of particular importance during this current pandemic there has been a theoretical uncertainty in regard to the safety of aceiarb use in patients with covid-19 based on the ace2 viral entry mechanism 71 72 the virus gains cellular entry by attaching to the ace2 receptor 72 ace2 expression and activity have shown to be increased in by aceiarb use 73 although there is theoretical risk that ace2 upregulation may increase the susceptibility of infection other conflicting evidence indicates that upregulation of ace2 in fact has a more protective effect studies in mouse models have shown that ace2 is protective against acute lung injury and blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system pathway decreases lung failure 74 75 based on the review of the literature to date the heart failure society of america recommends continuation of aceiarb use for patients that are prescribed them for heart failure hypertension and ischemic disease 76 abrupt discontinuation of medications is not recommended and can worsen clinical stability especially in patients with existing cardiovascular conditions 71 additionally statins have long been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties through multiple studies for instance simvastatin has been shown to decrease pulmonary inflammation in human subjects 77 although the benefits for cardiovascular patients have been numerous from a lipid lower standpoint it is important to note that the ability of statins to decrease inflammation also improves mortality 78 a retrospective analysis of patients from the veterans administration showed that statin use acei use or arb use each independently improved 30 day mortality of patients  65 years old who were hospitalized for pneumonia 79 however in the era of the covid-19 pandemic studies are needed to evaluate its role in covid-19related illness although cancer patients have been considered immunosuppressed as a result of their underlying malignancy and cytoreduction therapies patients that undergo immunotherapy including immune checkpoint inhibitors icis or car-t cell therapy may have different immuno-physiology that responds to covid-19 differently 80 anti-pd-1pd-l1 and anti-ctla-4 icis have been approved by the fda for use in a variety of cancers these drugs primarily work by enhancing a patients immune response to tumors through inhibiting negative regulators of t cell function 81 car-t cell therapy involves reprogramming a patients own t cells to directly target their specific tumor 82 an adverse effect that can occur with either anti-pd-1 therapy or car-t cell therapy involves cytokine release syndrome crs which is similar to the cytokine storm phenomenon that occurs in patients with severe covid-19 80 82 83 crs occurs as a result of hyperimmune activation in response to tumor death whereas cytokine storm in covid-19 patients occurs as a result of t cell hyperactivation from immune dysregulation 80 84 similar markers are elevated in both phenomena including il-6 tnf-alpha and ifn- of which il-6 has also been shown to be a mortality predictor in covid-19 patients 27 64 80 84 covid-19 patients that develop cytokine storm syndrome are at risk of developing ards and multi-organ failure 84 85 immunosuppression with tocilizumab an il-6 inhibitor is used to treat crs associated with car-t cell therapy 80 86 additionally tocilizumab immunosuppression is used to treat immune-related adverse events iraes from pd-1 inhibitors that are refractory to steroids iraes also occur as a result of hyperimmune activation 80 87 moreover the cytokine storm observed with covid-19 has also been noted to be similar to that of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh which is also treated with immunosuppression 64 current trials are underway with using tocilizumab and sarilumab another il-6 inhibitor to treat covid-19 patients 8890 although immunotherapy may be thought to reinstate a cancer patients immunocompetence there is potential for synergy from crs and the covid-19 cytokine storm pathogenesis which can further worsen a patients mortality risk further unfavorable synergy between ici immune-related adverse events iraes can also be seen potentially between the pneumonitis that icis can cause and the lung involvement with covid-19 80 pneumonitis occurs in  10 of patients being treated with anti-ctla-4 and anti-pd-1 icis and is potentially life-threatening 81 therefore if combined with lung injury from covid-19 there is a theoretical potential for poor outcomes there are potential cancer treatments that may counteract the pathogenesis of covid-19 such as ccr5 treatments and tyrosine kinase inhibitors tkis 9193 the ccr5 receptor is a g proteincoupled receptor selectively expressed on macrophages t cells eosinophils dendritic cells and microglia and is implicated in chemokine-mediated signaling 94 this receptor has historically been targeted for hiv antiviral therapy in the setting of disrupting viral entry specifically through small molecule inhibition with maraviroc and vicriviroc and monoclonal antibody treatment with leronlimab 95 moreover multiple cancers have been shown to overexpress ccr5 which has been linked to a cancers metastatic potential ccr5 therapies are currently being studied in metastatic colorectal and breast cancers 91 94 due to its immune system restorative properties leronlimab is being investigated for compassionate use in the treatment of covid-19 patients 96 97 studies examining receptor blockade in leronlimab preliminarily have shown decreases in il-6 restoration of cd4cd8 ratios and reduction in overall covid-19 viremia 98 these collective findings suggest possible therapeutic role in establishing immune reconstitution in patients that are critically ill and may provide dual benefit in patients with shared cancer diagnoses tkis like sunitinib and erlotinib that specifically inhibit aak1 a protein regulator that allows passage of the virus into cells have theorized utility 92 sunitinib is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor vegf tki which is used in first-line for treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma 99 erlotinib is an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor egfr tki which is used in first-line treatment for metastatic egfr-mutant non-small cell lung cancer 100 both these tkis have shown to reduce the infectivity of dengue and ebola through in vivo studies with murine models which showed decreased viremia and mortality with treatments moreover in vitro studies in cultured cells and hepatitis c in this same study showed that use of these tkis reduced intracellular trafficking and inhibited viral entry 101 however the high doses required to achieve this effect may potentially exhibit harm to patients 92 93 regardless there is potential for cancer patients receiving these therapies to achieve dual benefit as referenced before but warrant further investigation further studies are warranted in tracking the outcomes of cancer patients with covid-19 and the type of treatments they received patients with underlying hypertension diabetes and cancer are at higher risk for developing thrombotic events coagulopathy in coronavirus infection is now associated with high mortality and manifests with high d-dimer elevations 102 lung inflammation and impaired pulmonary gas exchange contributes to cytokine storm which leads to spike in d-dimer and pro-inflammatory response with impaired endothelial function tissue factor tf expressed by tumor cells contributes to thrombosis metastasis tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis leading to release of pro-coagulant microparticles into the circulation and triggering thromboembolism in patients with cancer 103 tf on circulating tumor cells leads to coating of cells with fibrin that traps them within microvasculature thereby contributing to worsening endothelial dysfunction 104 in patients with pre-existing cancer diagnoses shared covid infection as well as hypoxia places them at even greater risk of developing and incurring thrombotic events 105 early heparin initiation is posited to delay the spike in inflammatory biomarkers and may reduce contributions to pro-coagulopathic state 106 a retrospective study from china examined 449 patients classified as having severe covid-19 infection of which 272 had one or more chronic underlying diseases such as hypertension and heart disease patients were assigned to receive various forms of heparin with those treated with heparin having a lower mortality rate 40 vs 642 p  0029 107 data regarding initiation and choice of anticoagulation remains limited and further randomized clinical trials are necessary to determine prophylactic and treatment strategies for cardio-oncology patients infected with covid-19 as they represent a population with elevated theoretical risk for suffering from thromboembolic events the covid-19 pandemic has added a significant layer and complexity of how patient care is being delivered due to concerns of bidirectional transmission with no protective algorithm widely in place to dictate ongoing management of cancer patients 108 initiating cancer treatments such as targeted immunotherapies and chemotherapy require special consideration in the covid-19 era as previously described compromised immune systems render patients with cancer at higher risk for acquiring covid-19 infection and the sequelae that may ensue cancer treatment centers and cardio-oncologists must now consider not only the patient but also the integral healthcare workers who are regularly interfacing with high-risk exposures devising strategies to ensure robust testing services and clearance mechanisms to protect patient and healthcare personnel is one of many methods now employed to continue ongoing treatments 48 109 110 though there are no clear evidence-based modifications in systems of care to reduce transmission risk while balancing high-standard cardio-oncology care various strategies are proposed table 2 life-prolonging surgeries and procedures can slowly be pursued and continued although the risks of delaying any such advanced treatmentsincluding bone marrow transplantation and chimeric antigen receptor treatmentneed to be weighed carefully covid-19 screening and testing prior to these surgeriesprocedures while not infallible should be considered if available due to rising concern for asymptomatic carriers following completing anti-cancer treatments patients may additionally benefit from receiving immune system restorative treatments such as filgastrim additionally the transition to telemedicine to conduct interval cardiovascular and oncologic appointments can potentially protect patients from unnecessarily harmful nosocomial exposures 111 112 certain chronic conditions ie hypertension stablecompensated congestive heart failure may not necessarily require a face-to-face visit whereas highly symptomatic patients should still be seen in the cardio-oncology clinic preferably on the same day as their cancer outpatient visits deferring primary prevention assessments for example cholesterol monitoring unless otherwise indicated can augment protective mechanisms in place cardiovascular-related blood draws if necessary should be coincided with cancer-related treatments in addition the specter of cardiotoxicity related to certain cancer treatments also requires a reexamination of risk and benefit with respect to frequent cardiac monitoring due to previously mentioned concerns peri-chemotherapeutic events and development of cardiomyopathy ischemia and life-threatening arrhythmias are further worsened by simultaneous covid infection reducing reliance on frequent cardiac imaging in otherwise asymptomatic patients and providing in-mail ambulatory rhythm monitors for patients symptomatic with possible arrhythmias will further assist in mitigating exposure risk limited cardiac-imaging protocols ie focused just on ventricular function andor pericardial disease if necessary for symptomatic patients or those necessitating cardiotoxicity surveillance can also be devised to reduce exposure time in the healthcare setting in addition for patients at low risk of cardiotoxicity andor with prior serial-documented normal cardiac function it can be considered to defer serial cardiac imaging in certain treatments ie anti-her2 without anthracyclines braf-mek treatments in multidisciplinary discussions with oncology if the patient is asymptomatic 113 the covid-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented global impact on healthcare delivery and its trajectory continues to remain unclear vulnerable patient populations include those with cardiovascular disease and cancer and the cardio-oncology patient having possessed both these risk factors may unfortunately be at significantly increased risk of experiencing worse outcomes related to covid-19 infection as of this writing there are no known studies focusing on the cardio-oncology population and there remain many opportunities to not only study the epidemiology of this unique but also significant group of patients clinical trials are ongoing but rigorous randomized high-quality science is warranted to study the efficacy of previously mentioned treatments they also may potentially reveal critical mechanistic insights into covid-19s pathophysiology which overlap with cardiovascular and cancer disease states 114 in addition the abrupt and possibly permanent alteration of cardiovascular and cancer systems of carewith the dramatic rise of telemedicine and other changesto mitigate transmission risk in the covid-19 era also warrants close study to evaluate clinical outcomes much remains unknown about how the pandemic will affect the cardio-oncology population and how they will be cared for but what is certain is that ongoing close multidisciplinary care and communication between the cardiac and cancer care providers of these patients remains more critical than ever in order to guarantee the best care possible  clinical characteristics of 225 patients

jianqiang ding writing - review  editing conceptualization  cytokine storm in covid-19 patients transforms to a cytokine super cyclone in patients with risk factors betcy johnson susan malini laloraya   coronaviruses the positive-sense enveloped rna virus with 2632 kb genome belong to the coronaviridae family of viruses capable of infecting both humans and other animals1 virus infection affects both the respiratory and digestive systems of the host human coronavirus hcov can be categorized into two depending on their pathogenic capability hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 hcov-229e and hcov-hku are viruses that are included in low pathogenic hcov group that predominantly leads to infection in the upper respiratory tracts and results in common cold-like symptoms while severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and the lately recognized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2sars-cov-2coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 are highly pathogenic hcovs 23 unlike low pathogenic hcov these highly pathogenic viruses have increased disease severity and death rate because of its ability to infect lower respiratory tract leading to clinical features like pneumonia acute lung injury ali and ards 4 also sars cov2 showed 790 genome identity to sarscov and 50 to mers cov 5 similar to mers and sars covs bats are considered as natural host of sars cov2 the virus is then transmitted via intermediate host to human the intermediate host for mers cov sars cov and sars cov2 were identified as dromedary camels civets and pangolins respectively 6 viral entry into the host results in activation of innate immune mechanism together with the synthesis and secretion of inflammatory mediators interaction of specific viral components with pattern recognition receptors of the host immune system activates cellular signalling pathways that culminate in the production of various cytokines these cytokines elicit host response like extravasation of leukocytes and activation proliferation and cell differentiation of adaptive and innate immune system 78 interleukin il-1 il-18 and il-6 tumor necrosis factor tnf- interferon ifn- transforming growth factortgf- are the major cytokines while ccl-2monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp-1 mcp-3 ccl-3macrophage inflammatory protein mip-1 ccl-5 chemokine c-c motif ligand 5rantes regulated on activation normal t cell expressed and secreted and ifn--inducible protein-10 ip-10cxcl10 c-x-c motif chemokine 10 are the chemokines released during an influenza virus-induced infection 910 these cytokines exert host antiviral responses in different ways ifn- is a type 1 interferon that can inhibit viral replication thus inducing a potent antiviral state in the host 11 while tnf- triggers the immune cells localization at infection site and activation of caspases to promote apoptosis 12 il-1 is a pleiotropic cytokine which enhances inflammatory cell infiltration by increasing membrane permeability through activation of mast cells and subsequent release of histamine a vasodilator 13 il-6 mediates monocyte differentiation to macrophages and enhances mononuclear cell infiltration to the inflammation loci 14 moreover synergistically il-6 and tgf- induces maturation of naive helper t cells cd4 to t helper 17 th17 cells which are potential effectors against pathogens interestingly il-6 also hinders the treg expansion by tgf- 1516 enhancement of type 1 immunity activation of natural killer t cells nkt cells thus forming an early line of defence against viral infection are some of the biological actions of il-18 during viral infection 1718 although these cytokines are released either as host protection or response against viral entry exacerbated cytokine release can adversely affect the host by overreacting to its own system organs named as cytokine storm and was observed in both sars and mers infection resulting in the associated severe complications and multiple organ failure 19 studies have established that similar hypercytokinemiacytokine storm is also taking part in sars-cov2covid-19 infection in this review we highlight the pathology and pathogenesis of mers cov sars cov and sars cov2 with main focus into the role of cytokines in pathology and its relation with co-morbidities of covid-19 infection 20 according to who the middle east respiratory syndrome mers was observed in 2494 individuals and has a 344 case-fatality rate as of november 2019 r0 was estimated to be less than 1 indicating less transmissibility of virus 37 mers was reported in 27 countries globally the higher risk age group was 5059 years and mostly men were infected who 2019 httpapplicationsemrowhointdocsemrpub-csr-241-2019-enpdfua1ua1ua1 similar to sars-cov the early clinical indications of infection by mers-cov include cough dyspnea fever and myalgia which were then followed by the development of pneumonia in addition to symptoms associated with the respiratory system patients infected with mers-cov also experienced diarrhoea vomiting and abdominal pain interstitial infiltrates were observed in chest radiography of mers-cov infected individuals laboratory investigation showed increased concentration of ldh and aspartate aminotransferase ast low eosinophil and platelet count and decreased albumin level 38 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 or cd26 a cell surface protein is the functional receptor for mers-cov to enter host cells compared to other coronavirus mers-cov exhibits a wide range of in vitro tissue tropism because of the wide expression of dpp4 in different tissues like epithelial cells in the kidney small intestine alveoli prostate liver and activated t lymphocytes 39 in lungs dpp4 is expressed in multinucleated epithelial cells submucosal gland cells and bronchial pneumocytes but not in upper airway epithelium 40 additionally mers-cov can infect monocyte-derived-dendritic cells and macrophages when compared with sars-cov28 ultra-structural finding of mers infected patients showed the presence of viral particles in pneumocytes pulmonary and skeletal muscles macrophages and renal proximal tubular epithelial cells 41 furthermore up-regulation of smad7 and fgf2 fibroblast growth factor 2 expressions in kidney and lung by merscov resulted in cell death and tissue damage 42 infection of t cells of peripheral blood spleen and tonsils with mers cov resulted in activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways leading to cell death bear out the observation of lymphopenia in mers infection 43 moreover patients with co-morbidities like diabetes cardiovascular diseases end-stage renal disease and hypertension were more prone to fatal conditions 44 blood cytokine analysis performed in severely infected mers individuals demonstrated a marked increase in concentration of il-6 il-10 il-15 ip-10 il-17 tnf and ifn- 2 in comparison to controls 4445 additionally significantly increased mrna expression of il-8 il-12 ifn- rantes ip-10 mcp-1 and mip-1 were seen in human macrophages infected by mers-cov 46 suggesting that these cytokines are implicated in the infiltration of immune cell in lungs leading to hyper inflammation and finally progress to lung injury the first documented case of covid19 was in december 2019 from the wuhan city of china httpswwwwhointdocsdefault-sourcecoronavirusesituation-reports20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncovpdfsfvrsn20a99c104 and as of 22 june 2020 8860331 individuals were reported as sars-cov-2 positive resulting in the death of 465740 patients and have already affected 216 countries and regional territories globally thus sars-cov-2 pandemic fit in to the very high-risk category and has crossed statistics of the earlier epidemics caused by sar-cov and mers-cov httpswwwwhointdocsdefault-sourcecoronavirusesituation-reports20200622-covid-19-sitrep-154pdfsfvrsnd0249d8d2 according to who estimated r0 was 2- 25 which is less than that of sars however later a review reported r0 as 328 signifying high transmission capability of virus 47 initially majority of patients were presented with clinical indications like dry cough myalgia fever fatigue dyspnoea headache vomiting and diarrhoea at later stages severely infected patients showed clinical manifestations including pharyngeal pain dizziness abdominal pain and anorexia laboratory analysis of the patient samples revealed leucopenia lymphopenia high pro-thrombin time high levels of hepatic enzymes like ast ldh increased bio-markers of inflammation like erythrocyte sedimentation rate serum c-reactive protein and ferritin elderly people and those patients with underlying diseases like copd hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes belong to the high-risk group in which the disease might advance to fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome patients with sars cov2 infection showed ground-glass opacity and segmental consolidation of both lungs as patchy areas in computer-assisted tomography scan of the chest and was suffering from pneumonia other major complications of sars-cov2 infection include shock arrhythmia acute cardiac injury and secondary infection which finally need assistance by mechanical ventilation 4849 like sars cov ace2 is the primary cell entry receptor for sars cov2 into its host upon priming of spike protein of virus by cellular protease like tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 2 viral fusion with the cell membrane is triggered 24 on protein structural analysis receptor binding domain rbd of s protein of sars cov2 and sars cov showed 72 amino acid sequence identity indicating the higher affinity of sars cov2 to its receptor in comparison to sars cov50 furthermore furin-like cleavage site of sars cov2 spike protein also help in its priming making the virus more contagious interestingly this furin-like cleavage site was observed in human coronavirus oc43 and mers but not in sars cov 51 infection with cytopathic virus like sars-cov-2 results in inflammasome formation and pyroptosis mediated by caspase1 activation and associated inflammatory response 52 covid-19 infected patients showed higher concentration of peripheral blood immune mediators including mig il-6 ccl8 mcp-2 il-9 il-1 mip2-a cxcl2 tnf- cxcl16 il-2 il-1rainterleukin-1 receptor antagonist il-7 mip1- ip-10 il-8 basic fibroblast growth factor bfgf mcp-1 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csfgcsf ifn- gm-csfgranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mip1- pdgfplatelet-derived growth factor il-10 and vegfvascular endothelial growth factor il-2 il-6 il-7 ip-10 il-2r il-10 tnf- mip-1 mcp-1 and gscf levels positively correlated with disease severity suggesting that hypercytokinemia can aggravate immunopathology and inflammation 4853 54 55 only a few in vitro studies have been published so far on covid-19 and cytokine deregulation based on available medical and in vitro data it can be observed that there is a significant distinguishable pattern in the cytokine storm of covid-19 with sars-cov and mers-cov infection fig 1
 only three cytokines viz il-6 ip-10 and ifn- showed markedly elevated levels in all three highly pathogenic hcov infections in sars patients the level of ip -10 correlated with disease severity 31 it has been also shown that ip-10 induction in lungs leads to immune cell infiltration and apoptosis causing acute lung injury in sars 30 moreover increased levels of ip-10 were also associated with disease progression in mers-cov patients and continual high level as a sign of poor outcome 44 increased expression of mig and ip-10 chemo attractants that enlist activated t cells by chemokine receptor cxcr3 signalling was observed in inflammation specifically in activated bronchial epithelium 56 sars cov infection mice model showed up-regulation of ip-10 mig and its receptor in the lungs implicating the relevance of cxcr3 cascade to the development of ards in sars cov 57 enhanced cxcr3 signalling was previously reported with aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis 58 recent study on covid-19 reported that elevated levels of nasopharyngeal ip-10 can be used as a new biomarker for undiagnosed covid-19 case 59 this indicates the importance of ip-10 and its signalling in the progression to pneumonia and ultimately the fatality of covid-19 patients recent ex vivo experiment conducted in human lung tissue to address the viral features like high transmissibility and asymptomatic infection of sars-cov2 by inoculating sars-cov-2 or sars cov showed an increased capacity of sars-cov2 in infecting and replicating in human lung tissues more vigorously than sars-cov suggesting the existence of increased viral load in airway secretions seen in covid-19 patients even in the incubation period however sars-cov2 did not induce significant ifns type i ii iii and pro-inflammatory mediators except ip-10 in the human lung tissues ex vivo human lung tissue is not a perfect representative for host immune response this data of decreased inflammatory mediators contradict with existing reports of increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines even in moderately ill covid-19 patients 60 in another study peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc and balf transcriptome sequencing of sars-cov-2 infected patient revealed enrichment of mcp-1 ip-10 mip-1a and mip1b genes of note sars-cov-2 also induced apoptosis and p53 signalling pathways implicating the laboratory finding of lymphopenia in covid-19 patients 61 another major cytokine that mediate organ damage in cytokine storm is il-6 excessive secretion of il-6 results in activation of coagulation pathway conversion of naive t cells increase in vascular permeability and reduced cardiac function contribute to the increased disease severity 6263 sars patients also showed increased levels of il-6 which correlated with disease progression 30 increased levels of th17 cd4 t cells seen in covid-19 patients can be explained by high levels of il-6 which is implicated in t helper 17 th17 cells development 1664 interestingly spike protein of sars cov induced activation of nf-b signalling resulting in il-6 and tnf- secretion in murine macrophages 65 later in another study reported that inhibiting nf-b signalling was demonstrated with decreased il-6 levels and increased animal survival in sars 66 these studies implicate il-6 to be a key contributor to the patho-physiology of the cytokine-storm seen in both the sars cov infections one of the proposed mechanisms for decreased t cells in covid-19 infection could be mediated by increased levels of il-6 and increased interaction between fas and its ligand moreover an increased number of lymphocytes were observed in patients sars cov2 infection when treated with tocilizumab the il-6 receptor antagonist 6768 yet more studies are required for speculating the exact mechanism of sars cov2 induced lymphopenia and other immunological features as depicted in fig 1 altered mcp-1 il-2 mig and il-8 levels were observed in both sars cov and sars cov2 infected patients thus cytokine storm in sars-cov2 infection has been linked with both th1 which is mediated by ifn- ip-10 il-1  mcp-1 il-2 and th2 response mediated by il-10 48 which is different from that of sars-cov in which no change occurs in th2 cytokines 33 compared to sars cov more number of cytokines and chemokines are involved in the immune pathology of covid-19 common cytokine increased among sars cov2 and mers was il-10 ip-10 il-6 and tnf- speculating that sars cov2 show less similarity with mers cov even in eliciting an immune response when compared to sars cov these differences in cytokine release pattern by each pathogenic hcovs imply about the uniqueness in eliciting immune response and pathogenesis based on these observations it is reasonable to suggest that an increased response of th1 cytokines th2 cytokines and pro-inflammatory chemokines contribute to the immune pathology of covid-19 infection in contrast to sars which was predominantly mediated by ifn- induced th1 response 69 another study also demonstrated that covid-19 patients were presented with defective interferon activation and enhanced nfb mediated tnf- and il-6 production 70 moreover sars cov2 infection was also associated with defective ifn1 expression like sars cov this was confirmed by blancomelo et al on their experiments in ferret model infected cell line primary bronchial cells and serum cytokine profiling the authors have shown delayed ifn type1 and 111 expression along with increased levels of chemokines 55 single-cell sequencing scrna-seq of covid-19 patients showed impaired immune response by activation of pro-inflammatory signalling pathways in lung samples 71 these findings speculate that the combined action of exaggerated cytokine levels and defective antiviral innate immune response by interferons results in deterioration of sars cov2 infection interferon therapy for covid-19 patients has already been suggested 72 and findings of a clinical trial with interferon-2b have shown promising results 73 further studies will have to be performed to reveal the actual immune mechanism behind the pathogenesis and cytokine storm-induced hyper-inflammation during the disease comparative analysis of sars cov mers cov and sars cov2 is summarised in table 1
 although the occurrence of copd in covid-19 patients was reported as 32 74 the rate of disease severity and the mortality rate was markedly high with 60 and 63 respectively 75increasing the adverse effect of covid-19 by 59 fold 76 this data have to be stratified based on the cause and difference stages of copd interestingly current smokers tend to develop morecovid-19 associated complications compared to non-smokers and the collective frequency of smokers with covid-19 is 9 75 chronic exposure to environmental pollution smoking and other irritants eventually end up in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd main characteristic features of copd include inflammation of lung parenchyma obstruction in airflow pulmonary emphysema and chronic bronchitis 77 damage of epithelial cells results in the excessive infiltration of monocytesneutrophils and cytotoxic t lymphocytes cd8 t-cell to peripheral airways and lung parenchyma and consequent release of inflammatory mediators like chemokines cytokines and other proteases 78 spill over of these inflammatory mediators from airway inflammation to systemic circulation further results in systemic inflammation and associated manifestations a complex network of cytokines has been implicated in the inflammatory process of copd prominent cytokines elevated in both plasma and sputum samples of copd patients were il-18 vegf il-6 il-1 tnf- and il8 79 80 81 82 molecular mechanisms of disease were discovered using the protein-protein interaction ppi network analysis ppi interaction studies conducted by kumar spotted out cxcr4 tnf ccl5 ccl2 ifn- cxcl8 il-6 il-10 icam1 cxcl1 as the major genes involved in the copd high-risk group of covid-19 indicating the importance of cytokine signalling as one of the pathogenesis in copd patients with covid-19 83 additionally ace2 the entry point of sars cov2 expression was upregulated in lower airways epithelium of smokers and copd patients suggesting the increased entry of virus making them more vulnerable for the virus 84 thus underlying deregulated immune system with increased levels of cytokines and subsequent inflammation in copd superimpose sars cov2 induced hypercytokinemia further aggravating the fatality in the copd risk group of covid-19 patients a pooled analysis conducted by lippi g et al identified increased fatal conditions in covid-19 infected hypertensive patients by 25 fold 85 the development and progression of hypertension are under inherent and acquired immune surveillance triggers like angiotensin ii excessive salt diet etc could induce activation and permeation of various immune cells in kidneys heart and blood vessels the inflammatory mediators released by these cells culminate in vascular injury and inflammation 86 several studies have identified the profound role of il-1 il-6 il-8 il-17 il-18 il-23 ifn- tnf- and tgf- in the inflammatory pathogenesis of hypertension 87 an increased concentration of il-2 ifn- il-8 il-1 mcp-1 vegf epidermal growth factor and tnf- was observed in the serum of hypertensive patients 88 additionally il-4 and il-10 anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were notably lower in hypertensive patients in comparison to control subjects suggesting a skewed th1 th2 and th17 immune response stemming in the inflammatory pathogenesis of hypertension 8889 as discussed earlier covid-19 patients were shown to have high levels of il-1 mcp-1 il-6 il-2 tnf- and il-8 as these cytokines were also found to be increased in hypertension their role in deterioration of covid19 infection is suggestive moreover the role of the ras in pathology of hypertension is well described and type 1 at1 angiotensin ii ang ii receptor blockers arbs and angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors are given for hypertensive patients as most important therapeutic medicines 90 in addition to the increased ace2 expression decreased viral clearance also contributes to the intensified pathological scenario in covid-19 infections 91 computational network analysis picked cxcl8 vegfa ccl2 il-10 il-6 mmp-9 tnf as key genes in hypertension high-risk covid-19 patients 83 accordingly we can put forward that low-grade chronic inflammation seen in hypertensive patients ease the cytokine storm culminating in ards and death in covid-19 the death rate of covid-19 patients with cvd was 105 92 the deregulated immune system is one of the putative links between cvd and covid-19 high blood pressure hyperlipidemia insulin resistance and other factors activate complex inflammatory cascade leading to atherosclerosis chronic endothelial injury results in endothelial dysfunction with augmented vascular permeability followed by extravasation of t lymphocytes monocytes and mononuclear leukocytes this finally leads to macrophage activation foam cells formation and plaque development 9394 cytokines like il-1 il-6 pdgf il-8 ifn- tnf- and mcp-1 released from smooth muscle cells epithelial cells and immune cells of atherosclerotic plaque regulates its stability by modulating smooth muscle cell activity and apoptosis 9596 moreover the systemic concentrations of il-6 and il-18 are considered as a predictor of increased mortality in cvd patients 9798 cytokine network of high levels of il-18 il-1 tnf- il-8 ifn- il-6 pdgf and mcp-1 modulate inflammatory angiogenesis in cardiovascular disease 95 high level of ace2 expression seen in lungs and heart suggests defective ace2- signalling pathways causing cardiac injury in covid-19 although the risk of ace inhibitors for cvd treatment in covid-19 is still on debate other possible mechanisms in relation with covid-19 and heart injury comprise excessive inflammatory response mediated by cytokine storm hypoxia caused by apoptosis of myocardial cells and respiratory failure 99 moreover top genes in cvd risk of covid-19 infection identified by network analysis of protein-protein interaction as follows tnf il-6 ccl2 ccl5 cxcl8 cxcr4 and icam1 83 thus hyperinflammation in cvd because of increased pro-inflammatory cytokines add up the negative effects of cytokine storm induced by sars cov2 altered glucose homeostasis and immune imbalance could attribute to the increased susceptibility of diabetic patients for pathogens 100 ssars cov2 infected patients with diabetes had a 2 times increased risk of disease worsening and mortality compared to those with no diabetes 101 activated innate immune system and increased pro-inflammatory markers are linked with the pathogenesis of type2 diabetes t2dm and its microvascular complications like retinopathy nephropathy etc 102 these inflammatory mediators contribute to the augmentation of altered glucose metabolism insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity enhanced liver acute phase proteins synthesis and secretion and other inflammatory markers 103 tnf- mcp-1 il-6 and il-1 are prevalent cytokines that participate in the immune pathologic process of type 2 diabetes 104 additionally levels of il-4 tnf- il-7 gmcsf il-15 ifn-  il-1 tnf- il-12p70 mip-1 il-17a il-6 ip-10 il-10 mip-1 mcp-1 il-8 il-13 and il-9 and were increased in type 2 diabetic patients 105106 an immune-mediated inflammatory cascade is a crucial event in type1 diabetes which involves the activation and infiltration of t lymphocytes macrophages and various other immune cells and production of inflammatory mediators in the pancreas 107 increased levels of il-1 tnf- il-23 il-1 il-10 il-17a and il-6 were seen in type1 diabetic patients 108 109 110 study conducted in non-obese diabetic mice model showed ifn- can inhibit il-10 induction thereby altering t cell regulation 111 hence the basic levels of il-18 mcp-1 il-1 tnf- mip-1 ip-10 il-6 il-8 and mip-1 were high in diabetic patients with covid-19 and sars cov2 infection was associated with increased level of above mentioned cytokines the exuberant cytokines can be one of the cause of the severity and worsening in state of covid19 patients with diabetes patients suffering from type 1 or type 2 diabetes are given treatment of arbs and ace inhibitors this leads to increased ace2 expression in diabetic patients aiding sars cov2 infection in them 90 tnf cxcl8 il-10 ccl2 icam1 ifn- il-2 cxcr4 were the key genes identified by ppi network analysis for the covid-19 diabetic high-risk group 83 as described earlier diabetes is associated with hyperglycemia increased coagulation state altered immune system intense inflammatory response with heightened release of pro-inflammatory cytokines 112 facilitates sars cov2 induced cytokine storm that contribute to the disease severity of covid19 patients till now only one report shows gestational diabetes mellitus gdm as a comorbidity in two pregnant women who died because of covid-19 infection 113 role of inflammation and insulin resistance in gdm has been well described gdm is associated with altered cytokine concentrations that further enhance maternal insulin resistance high risk of pregnancy outcome and neonatal complications 114 pro-inflammatory cytokine like il-6 tnf- il-8 and il-18 were elevated in gdm patients along with low levels of il-10 115 on the basis of the above mentioned data one can envisage that elevated concentrations of these pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines in covid-19 patient with underlying risk factors furthermore intensifies the cytokine storm associated inflammation induced by sars cov2 thereby converting the cytokine-storm of covid-19 to a cytokine super cyclone fig 2
 importantly co-morbidities associated with covid-19 and sars cov2 infection have a shared cytokine profile indicating importance of anti-cytokine therapy however future projects are warranted to unveil the pathophysiological mechanisms of association between risk factors like copd hypertension cvd diabetes and covid-19 and disease management vaccines are given to raise immune protection against specific pathogens by inducing immunological memory bacillus calmette- gurin bcg the vaccine given for protection against mycobacteria infections is administered in new-born based on several clinical trials and observational studies it has been shown that bcg vaccination could reduce the neonatal as well as childhood death rate 116117 retrospective cross-sectional study conducted in sub-saharan african children of below 5 years demonstrated a positive association of bcg vaccination and lower threat of malaria 118 additionally epidemiological studies have also established the protective role of bcg against respiratory tract infections in children which are predominantly virus-mediated 119120 vaccination with bcg enhanced ifn- and il-10 level thus providing immunity against respiratory tract infection even in elderly age group 121 this is because bcg also provides some non-specific immune assistance like immunity against pathogens other than mycobacteria like virus and parasites and reduces the occurrence of allergy this is attained through a mechanism termed as trained immunity which is the immunological recall of the innate immune system via epigenetic reprogramming 122 innate immune cells like monocytes nk cells and macrophages undergo epigenetic modifications of histones that include methylation and acetylation enhances gene expression of il-6 tnf- and il-1 upon bcg vaccination thus the trained phenotype of innate immune cells results an increase in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines on exposure to non-specific pathogen enhancing host protection 123124 it has been experimentally shown that healthy subjects immunized with bcg show increased production of tnf- and il-1 in response to bacterial and non-bacterial stimulants increased h3k4me3 trimethylation of histone h3 at lysine 4 exposed promoter regions of these pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to their increased expression 125 in another study bcg vaccination reduced viremia in experimental human yellow fever virus infection model by inducing trained immunity by epigenetic modification of monocytes resulting in increased production of il-1 126 moreover bcg could enhance heterologous th1th17 responses by inducing the long-lasting release of il-22 ifn- and il-17 thereby attaining non-specific immune response to infections 127 in line with this several in vivo studies in murine models were also reported bcg immunized mice expressed antimicrobial peptides and bestowed protection against malarial parasitemia 128 additionally prior bcg vaccination in influenza virus challenged mice were found to have considerable protection via secretion of antibody or activation of cell-mediated immunity 129 a study conducted in mice model to understand the effect of bcg against various viral infections like herpes simplex type 1 influenza a2 and encephalomyocarditis viruses showed increased resistance of bcg immunised mice against these viruses compared to control mice 130 specifically bcg vaccinated newborn mice were shown to be more resistant against herpes simplex type 2 infection 131 based on these observations it has been proposed that bcg vaccine has the potential to act as a protective agent against sars cov2 as it provides antiviral immunity 132 sars-cov2 virus enhances the generation of il-6 ifn- tnf- and il-1 in mild to severely infected patients 48 as discussed earlier the trained immunity of bcg vaccine involves the release of these cytokines thus providing an antiviral state and earlier protection against sars-cov2 fig 3
 ozdemir et al has already documented a marked decrease in the number of cases per population death per population and deaths per cases ratio of covid-19 in bcg vaccinated countries than bcg-non-vaccinated countries 133 another observational study conducted in 25 level 4 european countries found a positive correlation of bcg vaccination and decreased death rate in covid 19 but could not found any association with pneumococcal vaccine and seasonal influenza vaccination even after adjusting with several covariates like days from day 1 to lockdown life-expectancy the net migration median age case-fatality rate the proportion of the population living in an urban setting population size population density and elderly dependency ratio 134 moreover bcg vaccination protocols and bacteria strains used are different among bcg vaccinated countries 135 epidemiological analysis of bcg vaccination on covid 19 based on these data-set has to be done in future for better understanding furthermore it is also significant to study the impact of covid-19 infection in patients with co-morbidities like diabetes hypertension copd and cardiovascular disease in bcg vaccinated and non-vaccinated countries although multiple studies support the hypothesis of the generic defensive role of bcg vaccine against the covid 19 pandemic 136137 controversies have been reported on the same aspect 138139 as each study has used different data extraction indicators statistical analysis and correction with confounding variables they cannot give ultimate evidence of causality and underscore the importance of clinical trials to conclude upon the association of bcg with covid-19 infection as of now a total of 16 clinical trials were registered in clinicaltrialsgov run by the united states national library of medicine to delineate bcg induced trained immunity protection against sars cov2 httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2resultscondcovidtermbcgcntrystatecitydist out of 16 only 8 studies started recruitment of participants among these bcg-corona reducing health care workers absenteeism in covid-19 pandemic by enhanced trained immune responses through bacillus calmette-gurin vaccination a randomized controlled trial brace bcg vaccination to reduce the impact of covid-19 in healthcare workers following coronavirus exposure bcg vaccine for health care workers as defense against covid 19 badas and bcg vaccination for healthcare workers in covid-19 pandemic are conducting their trials in healthcare workers as they are more vulnerable to covid 19 infection the primary objective of brace badas and bcg vaccination for healthcare workers in covid-19 pandemic is to analyse the occurrence and severity of covid-19 in bcg vaccinated and non vaccinated groups while bcg-corona trial is estimated to involve 1500 health workers and aims to assess whether unplanned absenteeism of these participants can be reduced by bcg vaccination in the covid-19 pandemic since existing reports regarding the protective role of bcg and covid-19 were based on observational data analysis the results of these trials are crucial to getting a definite conclusion who has not yet advised bcg immunization against sars-cov2 infection httpswwwwhointnews-roomcommentariesdetailbacille-calmette-guc3a9rin-bcg-vaccination-and-covid-19 in addition to clinical trials more epidemiological studies are required to strategize the status of co- morbidities and associated death in bcg vaccinated covid-19 cases these data are important to envisage the safeguarding nature of bcg vaccine against covid-19 as high-risk patients are more prone to the lethal effect of sars cov2 virus infection leads to activation of multiple immune pathways finally culminating in virus removal from the host in rare cases the immune system gets over-activated triggering a cascade of events that is ultimately fatal for the patient uncontrolled secretion of cytokines of the innate immune system is associated with hyper inflammation and ards in covid 19 patients and is well established another important finding is that levels of cytokines correlate with disease severity interestingly increasing cytokine levels due to over-stimulated immune response upon covid-19 infection results in synergistic action of covid-19 induced cytokine-storm and cytokine-upheaval in high-risk patients with co-morbidities leading to extensively severe clinical manifestations culminating in high mortality associated with this disease while on the other hand trained immunity of bcg vaccine involves the secretion of il-1 tnf- and il-6 thus providing an antiviral state and early protection against sars-cov2 dr malini laloraya is supported by department of biotechnology dbt-rajiv gandhi centre for biotechnology bsj supported by research fellowship from department of science  technology dst inspire fellowship20151f150361

muacevic john adler r faryal tahir taha bin arif jawad ahmed farheen malik muhammad khalid   several epidemics and pandemics have plagued the earth since the beginning of time the plague of justinian is believed to be the first pandemic in history dating back to 541-750 ad which was followed by the great bubonic plague that killed over 125 million people 1 several different epidemics have been caused by beta-coronaviruses beta-cov in the last 20 years the first epidemic was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov from 2002 to 2003 followed by middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 1 seven years after the mers-cov epidemic an unknown pathogen infected the people in wuhan china in december 2019 patients reported to local hospitals with respiratory symptoms and scientists eventually identified a new member of beta-cov as the causative agent for the disease 2 on january 12 2020 the world health organization who named the virus as the 2019-novel coronavirus 2019-ncov by january 20 cases of 2019-ncov were reported from three other countries namely thailand japan and south korea the genome was rapidly identified and by january 30 this outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern and the disease was named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 on february 11 the coronavirus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses named the new virus sars-cov-2 on march 11 the disease was declared a pandemic by the who 3 over the last three months the disease has spread rapidly from 282 cases to over 21 million cases worldwide 3 the basic reproduction number r0 is an indicator of the transmissibility of a virus it shows the expected number of new infections generated by an infected individual in a susceptible population if r0 is more than 1 the number of new cases is likely to increase 4 the mean r0 for sars-cov-2 is 328 14-649 which is comparable to sars but the more widespread and rapid rise in the number of cases indicates higher transmissibility of sars-cov-2 4 as covid-19 is a very rapidly emerging disease new evidence and information are being reported daily however due to the emergence of such a large number of studies disease- and organ-specific reviews are necessary to provide an updated and comprehensive summary of all literature for physicians who currently cannot spare their precious hours to go through vast online databases hence we searched pubmed embase scopus google scholar sciencedirect wiley and coronavirus collections of all major publishing groups to identify literature related to cardiac involvement in covid-19 in this review we summarize the cardiac manifestations of covid-19 and their prognoses origin and epidemiology of covid-19 in december 2019 people in wuhan china started visiting local hospitals with pneumonia-like symptoms due to unknown causes many of the index cases history linked them to exposure to the huanan seafood wholesale market china notified the who about the outbreak on december 31 2019 and closed the huanan market on january 1 2020 for cleaning and disinfection 3 on january 7 2020 scientists were able to isolate and identify the sequence of 2019-ncov all genome sequences from different patients were almost identical indicating the recent emergence of disease in humans 5 since its origin in china the sars-cov-2 infection has become a pandemic and spread to 209 countries according to the latest who covid-19 situation report april 18 2020 2160207 cases and a total of 146088 deaths have been reported so far an overwhelming number of 6710 new deaths were reported in the last 24 hours the three countries with the highest number of cases till april 18 2020 are the united states 665330 spain 188068 and italy 172434 3 an increase in percentage mortality over time has been observed in the who covid-19 status reports from january 21 to april 18 2020 figure 1 3 structure of sars-cov-2 coronaviruses covs are a broad family of viruses that primarily affect the respiratory system four genera of cov have been identified alpha beta gamma and delta sars-cov-19 a ribonucleic acid rna virus belongs to subgenus sarbecovirus of the genus beta-cov a total of six other covs that can infect humans have also been identified other widely known members of the cov family that were identified earlier include sars-cov and the mers-cov both belonging to the beta genus and capable of causing life-threatening respiratory infections the other four are human coronavirus hcov-229e hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 which cause milder disease 256 the gross structure of sars-cov-2 identified in patients in wuhan appeared spherical with some degree of pleomorphism on electron micrographs 2 the diameters of viral particles were between 60 to 140 nm and the size of spikes was about 9-12 nm which appeared like a crown 2 the strain of sars-cov-2 is 299 kb 7 open reading frames orfs vary in number from 6-11 in the cov genome the first orf has two-thirds of viral rna which encodes for non-structural proteins and translates two polyproteins pp1a and pp1b while the structural and accessory proteins are encoded by other orfs the four essential structural proteins include 1 spike s glycoprotein 2 nucleocapsid n protein 3 matrix protein and 4 envelope e protein 8-10 sars-cov and mers-cov have genomes of 279 kb and 301 kb respectively 11 the sars-cov-2 is more closely related to two sars-like covs derived from bats bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 with up to 88 similarity in identity but distant from sars-cov and mers-cov identity 79 and 50 respectively 25 this evidence suggests possible origin from bats 5 reservoir host and transmission based on its origin and spread in the wuhan market where there was an abundance of all sorts of animals it is highly possible that covid-19 has a zoonotic origin and it transmitted to humans through an intermediate host 10 identification of sars-like covs in bats which were similar to sars-cov-2 shows the possibility that bats can be a reservoir host for its progenitor 12 it also indicates that mammals are likely to be a link between humans and covid-19 13 based on recent research there are two species of snake that could also be a possible reservoir for sars-cov-2 14 however no study has yet found any substantial evidence of a reservoir of sars-cov-2 other than birds and mammals human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 is possible and accounts for the majority of cases now 31014 sars-cov-2 is highly infective and transmission of the disease is through direct contact with an affected individual or through respiratory droplets produced by coughing or sneezing there is recent evidence of possible vertical transmission from a mother to her newborn 15 a recent study by luo et al has also shown that the virus is unlikely to be weakened in high temperatures and humidity and cluster transmission is possible even at conditions that were earlier thought to be unsuitable for viral transmission 16 the higher infectivity of sars-cov-2 can also be understood through its higher viability in the air as well as on different surfaces 17 sars-cov-2 can remain viable in air for more than three hours and on plastic and steel for more than 72 hours on copper and cardboard the viability of sars-cov-2 is less than four hours and 24 hours respectively 17 this high viability time period on different surfaces can lead to indirect transmission of sars-cov-2 to healthy individuals if they come into contact with objects used on covid-19 patients such as stethoscope or thermometer 18 there have been no cases of fecal-oral transmission to date and airborne transmission is possible in situations where there is aerosol production such as bronchoscopy open suctioning nebulization tracheostomy intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation 18-20 aerosol generation from the fecal matter of affected individuals such as by flushing toilets or treatment of excreta in rural areas may cause viral spread 21 pathogenesis and clinical presentation sars-cov-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor ace2-r for entry into the cells s protein of the virus binds to ace2-r this binding causes a conformational change in s protein and leads to fusion of viral envelope with the host cell membrane and sars-cov-2 rna is released into the host cell genome rna is translated into polyproteins pp1a and pp1b which are further broken into proteinases other viral proteins are produced by the translation of subgenomic messenger rna mrna in the endoplasmic reticulum er and golgi apparatus the viral genome and proteins are assembled into virions the newly formed virions are transferred to the cell membrane and released out of the cell 22 ace2 is found in the lower respiratory tract in humans and the virus can be transmitted to the airway directly by respiratory droplets or touching of the nose after touching an infected surface 1822 initial clinical presentation of the disease is usually asymptomatic or mild with symptoms such as cough sore throat rhinorrhea headache fever shortness of breath sob nausea vomiting diarrhea and fatigue in some patients the disease can progress to pneumonia respiratory failure acute cardiac injury aci multi-organ failure mof and ultimately death 2324 a recently published study by huang et al reported detailed symptoms of 41 patients affected by covid-19 24 symptoms at onset commonly included fever 98 cough 76 and myalgiafatigue 44 less common presenting symptoms were the production of sputum 28 headache 8 hemoptysis 5 and diarrhea 3 as the illness progressed dyspnea leukopenia and lymphopenia developed in 55 25 and 63 of the patients respectively all admitted patients developed pneumonia with bilateral pulmonary involvement multiple consolidations and bilateral ground-glass opacity visible on ct scan a total of 15 of the admitted patients expired complications developed by patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 29 rnaaemia 15 aci 12 secondary infection 10 and complications requiring intensive care unit icu admissions 32 24 level of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines such as interleukin il 1- il1ra il7 il8 il9 il10 basic fibroblast growth factor 2 bfgf2 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor gcsf granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf interferon-gamma ifn interferon-inducible protein 10 ip10 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp1 macrophage inflammatory proteins mip 1 mip1 platelet-derived growth factor subunit b pdgfb tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf and vascular endothelial growth factor a vegfa were elevated in both icu and non-icu patients 24 pro-inflammatory cytokines namely il2 il7 il10 gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf were only elevated in icu patients suggesting a possible association with increased disease severity 24 cardiac involvement in covid-19 covid-19 can lead to cardiac involvement and injury via the following possible mechanisms 1 indirect injury due to increased cytokines and immune-inflammatory response 2 direct invasion of cardiomyocytes by sars-cov-2 and 3 respiratory damage from the virus causing hypoxia leading to oxidative stress and injury to cardiomyocytes 25-27 these mechanisms are graphically represented in figure 2 which is adapted from 27 along with the presence of ace2 in the respiratory tract it is also found in the heart and sars-cov-2 can use ace2 to enter the cells 2728 the mechanism of heart injury in covid-19 is still not entirely clear ie it is unclear as to whether binding of sars-cov-2 alters the expression of ace2 or causes abnormality in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas 27 however multiple studies analyzing acute myocardial injury ami in covid-19-affected individuals have been published ami was detected by high levels of serum c-reactive protein crp creatine kinase ck and troponins affected individuals often had a history of chronic diseases such as diabetes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd hypertension and coronary artery disease cad ami was also associated with a longer hospital stay 2429-43 critically ill patients had a higher likelihood of myocardial injury which was associated with poor outcomes and an increased risk of in-hospital mortality 32373941 discussion of studies multiple studies that highlight the clinical features laboratory findings and prognosis of ami in covid-19-affected individuals have been published so far these studies are discussed below in a single-center retrospective case series wang et al delineated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia ncip among 138 consecutively hospitalized patients at zhongnan hospital wuhan 29 epidemiological demographic clinical laboratory radiological and treatment data were collected from january 1 to 28 2020 the authors then compared the outcomes of critically ill and non-critically ill patients among all the patients 543 n75 were male with a median age of 56 years comorbidities were found in 464 n64 of the patients among whom cardiovascular disease cvd was appreciated in 145 n20 among all the icu-bound patients n36 25 n9 were reported to have cardiovascular comorbidity the median heart rate hr of all patients and those in the icu was found to be 88 beats per minute bpm and 89 bpm respectively similarly the mean arterial pressure map of all patients and patients bound to icu was recorded as 90 mmhg and 91 mmhg respectively aci was appreciated in 72 n10 222 n8 and 2 n2 in all icu bound and non-icu-bound n102 patients respectively p0001 furthermore arrhythmia was found in 167 n23 444 n16 and 69 n7 in all icu-bound and non-icu-bound patients respectively p0001 to recapitulate the authors established a mortality rate of 43 29 huang et al investigated the clinical features of patients infected with 2019-ncov in wuhan china 24 out of a total 41 hospital-admitted patients identified as having laboratory-confirmed covid-19 the majority n30 73 were men and less than half had underlying comorbidities such as diabetes n8 20 hypertension n6 15 and cvd n6 15 the median age was 49 years aci n5 12 was the third most common complication in these patients after ards and rnaemia out of 13 patients admitted to icu four 31 had an aci and five died the study concluded that severe respiratory illness with 2019n-cov infection with deteriorating complications was associated with icu admission and a higher mortality rate 24 zhang et al retrospectively evaluated the clinical characteristics of 82 hospitalized patients who died of covid-19 from january 11 to february 10 2020 in the renmin hospital wuhan 30 in this study the majority of the deceased patients were male 659 n54 with a higher mortality rate found among older individuals significantly 805 n66 of non-survivors were 60 years of age a major bulk 768 n62 of the deceased individuals had some existing comorbidity and among them 207 n17 had heart disease cardiac damage was found in 89 n73 of patients while cardiac failure cf 146 n12 was the third most common cause of death after acute respiratory failure arf 695 n57 and sepsis syndromemof 28 n23 along with other abnormal laboratory findings levels of crp 10 ul cardiac troponin t tnt 004 pgml ck 200 ul myoglobin 110 gl lactate dehydrogenase ldh 250 ul and creatine kinase myocardial band ck-mb 5 ngml were found to be much higher in 100 n58 867 n52 347 n25 60 n42 93 n68 and 30 n21 of the deceased cases respectively the authors concluded that either the virus itself or the storm of released cytokines in its response might have aggravated damage to vital organs including the heart 30 in a retrospective single-center study of medical records hui et al investigated the correlation between clinical features and aci among patients affected with covid-2019 pneumonia 31 in this study records of 41 consecutive cases of covid-19 19 males and 22 females from beijing youan hospital in china between january 21 and february 03 2020 were studied including two deaths in view of the 6th guidance provided by the national health commission of china 488 n2 7805 n32 975 n4 and 732 n3 of the patients were labeled as light mild severe and critical cases respectively the median age of the patients was found to be 47 years and adult males were found more prone to develop a severe infection underlying comorbidities such as hypertension cad diabetes mellitus dm type 2 and tumor were found in 244 n10 of the patients while severe and critical cases were notably substantial in the cardiac-related chronic disease group moreover as compared to the normal value of troponin i tni a 40-fold increase in its peak value and a higher crp level 191 mgl was recorded among critical patients which translated into a higher risk of cardiac injury atrial fibrillation afib with hr inclining up to 160 bpm was recognized in 488 n2 of patients all of them were under critical category and eventually died reduced epicardial adipose tissue eat density was shown on the ct scans of severe -9608 hu and critical -9877 hu cases indicating cardiac inflammation the authors concluded that patients under light and mild categories rarely exhibited cardiac injury whereas it was found more commonly among severe and critical patients where tachycardia elevated levels of tni and low eat density were regarded as the main risk factors to intercept fatality among covid-19 patients the authors suggested close monitoring of the cardiac functioning of all patients especially the severe and critical ones and to seek possible interventions for patients evincing features of abnormal cardiac injury 31 wu et al conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study to explore whether heart injury occurs in covid-19 and if it aggravates mortality later 32 among 188 patients with covid-19 the mean age was 519 years range 21-83 years and 119 633 were male older patients and patients with comorbidity especially hypertension tended to have increased high-sensitivity troponin i hs-tni levels on admission and a high mortality rate was associated with high hs-tni on admission 6126 pgml further it was noticed that high hs-tni levels were associated with increased inflammatory levels neutrophils il-6 crp procalcitonin pct and decreased immune levels lymphocytes monocytes cluster of differentiation cd4 and cd8 t cells raised ck-mb levels tended to occur only in male patients and current smokers and were associated with higher mortality increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes similarly increased ldh and -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase -hbdh tended to occur in older and hypertensive patients and were associated with higher mortality rates increased inflammatory and decreased immune levels subsequently hs-tni p005 and ldh levels p0022 on admission day were negatively correlated with survival days hence it was concluded that heart injury signs arise in covid-19 especially in older patients hypertensives and male patients with current smoking habits elevated levels of heart injury indicators are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days the authors suggested that covid-19 might attack the heart by inducing an inflammatory storm and patients with signs of heart injury must be identified primarily and carefully treated by cardiologists 32 to investigate the clinical characteristics and eventual prognosis of covid-19 patients with already existing cvd peng et al retrospectively analyzed 112 patients who visited the union hospital wuhan from january 20 to february 15 2020 33 depending on the clinical severity of the disease all the patients were grouped into two categories critical n16 and general n96 in comparison with the general group lymphocyte count 074109l 034109-094109l was found to be extremely low in the critical group whereas in the same group crp 10698 mgl 8157-13576 mgl pct 020 gl 015-048 gl and body mass index bmi 255 kgm2 230-275 kgm2 were found to be much higher a further assortment of patients into groups of survivors and non-survivors showed higher bmi 25 kgm2 and lactic acid levels 170 mmoll 130-300 mmoll among the non-survivors whereas the oxygen index 130 102-415 was found to be much lower in the same category keeping in view either the critical and general groups or the survivor and non-survivor groups medication with ace inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker arb did not impact the morbidity and mortality related to covid-19 in patients with any preexisting cardiac disease hence the authors concluded that a higher risk of mortality existed among covid-19 patients with already existing cardiac diseases where fulminant inflammation lactic acid accumulation and thrombotic events are regarded as the main exacerbating factors 33 a cross-sectional study by chen et al evaluated the cardiovascular damage in patients with covid-19 34 a total of 150 covid-19 cases were included from tongji hospital wuhan and the patients were divided into groups of mild cases n126 and critical care cases n24 age hypersensitive crp hs-crp and serum creatinine levels of the patients were observed to be higher in critical care cases than in mild cases all p005 critical care patients had a higher prevalence of males elevated n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide nt-probnp and cardiac troponin i ctni hypertension and coronary heart disease chd all p005 elevated ctni odds ratio or 26909 95 ci 4086-177226 p0001 and chd or 16609 95 ci 2288-120577 p0005 were found to be the independent risk factors of critical disease status according to multivariate logistic regression analysis the authors concluded that covid-19 could significantly affect heart function and lead to myocardial injury the two crucial independent determinants of clinical disease status in patients with covid-19 were the past medical history of chd and an increased level of ctni 34 xu et al investigated the clinical characteristics and risk factors of ami in covid-19 patients 35 a total of 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized covid-19 patients were included in the study out of 42 7925 patients with cardiac complications the majority n30 had elevated cardiac enzymes followed by diastolic dysfunction n20 tachycardia n15 electrocardiography abnormalities n11 and ami n6 all patients with ami were aged 60 years and five of them also had two or more comorbidities hypertension diabetes cvd and copd furthermore it was noticed that the severity of novel coronavirus pneumonia ncp was higher in these patients than in patients with non-definite ami p0001 three of these ami patients died while two remained hospitalized in the icu covid-19 patients with ami had higher mean systolic pressure than other groups p0001 according to multivariate analysis the major risk factor for cardiac abnormalities in covid-19 patients were elevated crp levels p0001 or 1186 95 ci 1047-1344 ncp severity p0001 or 2896 95 ci 1266-6621 and underlying comorbidities p0001 or 4336 95 ci 111-3855 the occurrence of hypertension was higher in the ami group n4 6667 similarly cvd was more frequently found in ami patients n4 6667 all of whom had a history of cad with one having prior coronary artery bypass grafting cabg other comorbidities like diabetes and copd were found in all patients with a significant occurrence in ami patients diabetes n2 copd n2 compared to other groups about 30 covid-19 patients exhibited elevated cardiac markers out of them ami and non-definite ami patients had higher cardiac markers than other groups p005 d-dimer levels on admission were also elevated in the ami patients median165 gml and patients with abnormal cardiac markers median079 gml and were subsequently higher than those in patients with normal cardiac markers median055 gml p0001 among 24 patients exhibiting echo abnormalities a higher frequency was found in ami patients manifesting as left ventricular lv wall thickening and diastolic dysfunction left atrial enlargement lv enlargement and mitral aortic and triple valve regurgitation 35 liu et al conducted a single-center retrospective study to analyze the association of cardiovascular manifestations with in-hospital outcomes of covid-19 cases 36 case details of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed covid-19 were collected at the central hospital of wuhan china the mean age of the population was 391  92 years about 24 585 cases had cardiovascular manifestation cvm patients with cvm had comparatively lower baseline lymphocyte count p0001 had more incidence of positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab p0011 and received more oxygen support p0001 similarly the rate of in-hospital effects was significantly higher in the cvm group p0001 multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the coexistence of cvm and ncp was not independently associated with in-hospital adverse effects or 223 95 ci 024-2027 p0478 however a tendency of significance was noticed in baseline lymphocyte count between the two groups in the model or 015 95 ci 002-126 p0081 36 he et al analyzed the clinical characteristics of severe or critically ill patients with covid-19 and evaluated the impact of the complicated myocardial injury on the prognosis of these patients 37 fifty-four patients who met the criteria of severe or critical conditions of covid-19 were included in this retrospective study the median age of patients was 68 24 444 patients had hypertension 13 241 had diabetes eight 148 had chd and three 56 had previous cerebral infarction it was noticed that 24 444 patients were complicated with myocardial injury and 26 481 patients died during the hospital stay patients with myocardial injury had higher in-hospital mortality rates than those without myocardial injury n14 609 with myocardial injury vs n8 258 without myocardial injury p0013 moreover patients with significant myocardial injury exhibited significantly higher levels of crp 1536 ngl vs 498 ngl and nt-probnp 8520 ngl vs 1970 ngl than patients without myocardial injury all p001 this study postulated that severe or critically ill covid-19 patients have a higher prevalence of myocardial injury and these patients face a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality hence it is vital to monitor and manage the myocardial injury during hospitalization for severe or critically ill covid-19 patients 37 in another retrospective comparison of the clinical features of recovered versus deceased patients with covid-19 deng et al collected data from two hospitals in wuhan 38 out of the total enrolled covid-19 patients 109 died during hospitalization whereas 116 recovered the median age was higher in the deceased group as compared to the recovered group 69 years vs 40 years p 0001 levels of creatinine 8900 moll vs 6500 moll p 0001 and crp 10925 mgl vs 322 mgl p  0001 were found to be significantly higher in the deceased group versus the recovered one complications were recorded to be higher among the deceased group in which aci 596 vs 08 p 0001 was found to be much higher as compared to the recovered group 38 to investigate the epidemiological and clinical features of patients infected with covid-19 and cardiac injury liu et al collected and analyzed data of medical records from january 10 to february 24 2020 39 among 291 patients from guangzhou eighth peoples hospital 52 n15 had a cardiac injury patients with cardiac injury were comparatively older than those without injury the median age was found to be 65 years there was a male predominance among cardiac injury patients as 733 n1115 of them were male hypertension 466 n7 and chd 20 n3 were the most predominant comorbidities among individuals presenting with a cardiac injury moreover common symptoms of covid-19 like fever 733 n11 cough 467 n7 headache or fatigue 333 n5 and dyspnea 266 n4 without any complaints of chest pain and palpitations were appreciated in this group patients who had cardiac injury showed relatively higher systolic blood pressure bp 132 mmhg vs 124 mmhg tni 007 ugl vs 0003 ugl and bnp 2455 pgml vs 185 pgml levels when compared with those without cardiac injury nevertheless the levels of crp were found to be raised among all patients with cardiac injury n1515 among all the enrolled patients ards 20 n3 and severe pneumonia 733 n11 were reported more commonly in cases with a cardiac injury which complicated the disease the authors concluded that cardiac injury can be commonly found among patients with covid-19 where it worsens the clinical outcomes and hence should be regarded as a potential prognostic risk indicator 39 zhou et al studied the clinical characteristics of myocardial injury in patients with covid-19 40 a total of 34 patients with covid-19 were included in this study who were further divided into two groups patients with severe covid-19 n26 and those with very severe covid-19 n8 the median age was 63 years in the severe covid-19 group and 67 years in the very severe group the authors noted significantly increased ctni 468 ngl vs 48 ngl ck 199 ul vs 88 ul -hbdh 453 ul vs 245 ul and ldh 513 ul vs 287 ul in the very severe group as compared to the severe group the percentage of very severe patients with elevated ctni levels was markedly higher as all eight patients with very severe disease exhibited increased ctni while only one patient with severe disease had raised ctni levels p0001 this study concluded that patients with very severe covid-19 have a higher percentage of increased ctni levels and their mortality rate can be improved by protecting them from myocardial injury 40 to explore the association between cardiac injury and mortality in patients with covid-19 shi et al conducted a single-center cohort study at renmin hospital of wuhan university china 41 they included a total of 416 hospitalized patients with covid-19 in the final analysis with a median age of 64 years about 82 patients 197 were declared to have a cardiac injury in comparison with patients without cardiac injury these individuals were older p0001 had more comorbidities such as hypertension p0001 had higher leukocyte counts median 9400 and higher levels of crp median 102 pct median 027 ck-mb median 32 myohemoglobin median 128 hs-tni median 019 nt-probnp median 1689 aspartate aminotransferase ast median 40 and creatinine median 115 and had a higher proportion of multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity in radiographic findings 646 patients with cardiac injury required a greater proportion of non-invasive mechanical ventilation p0001 or invasive mechanical ventilation p0001 similarly complications like ards p0001 acute kidney injury aki p0001 electrolyte disturbances p0003 hypoproteinemia p001 and coagulation disorders p002 were higher in patients with a cardiac injury a higher mortality rate p0001 was noticed in patients with cardiac injury 512 than those without cardiac injury 45 additionally patients with cardiac injury were at a higher risk of death both during the time from onset of symptoms hr 426 95 ci 192-949 and from admission to endpoint hr 341 95 ci 162-716 according to cox regression model the study concluded that cardiac injury is a prevalent condition among hospitalized patients with covid-19 in wuhan china and it is associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality 41 in order to depict the clinical characteristics of 113 deceased patients owing to covid-19 infection chen et al retrospectively evaluated a case series among a cohort of 799 confirmed cases of covid-19 admitted to tongji hospital from january 13 to february 12 2020 42 in comparison with the recovered cases deceased patients were mostly male 73 n83 with a median age of 68 years among all those who died chronic hypertension 48 n54 and other cardiovascular abnormalities 14 n16 were the predominant comorbidities vital signs revealed higher median systolic bp 137 mm hg arterial pressure 140 mm hg and hr 1010 bpm among deceased patients apart from other abnormal laboratory findings considerably higher levels of crp ck ldh ctni 408 pgml and nt-probnp 800 pgml were appreciated among the deceased patients moreover eight deceased patients exhibited more than 1000 pgml ctni whereas two of them had more than 10000 pgml the disease was more frequently complicated among the deceased patients with the occurrence of aci n7294 and hf n4183 in 77 and 49 of the individuals respectively it was also observed that individuals with cardiovascular comorbidity were more susceptible to the development of cardiac complications however cardiac injury and hf were still more common among deceased patients as compared to the recovered ones regardless of any history of cardiac disease the authors concluded that aci and hf were among the most common complications that affected the prognosis of critically ill patients 42 to evaluate the association of underlying cvd and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with covid-19 guo et al conducted a retrospective single-center study 43 a total of 187 patients with confirmed covid-19 were selected and their demographic data laboratory findings comorbidities and treatments were analyzed regardless of elevation in tnt levels overall 66 353 patients had underlying cvd manifested as hypertension chd and cardiomyopathy while 52 278 patients exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated tnt levels patients with cvd and elevated tnt levels had a higher mortality rate 6944 than other groups ie patients without underlying cvd and normal tnt 762 patients with underlying cvd and normal tnt 1333 and patients without underlying cvd but elevated tnt 375 similarly patients with underlying cvd were more likely to present with elevated tnt than those without cvd 545 vs 132 plasma tnt levels depicted a significantly positive linear correlation with plasma hs-crp 0530 p0001 and nt-probnp levels 0613 p0001 similarly plasma tnt and nt-probnp levels elevated significantly during hospitalization median 0307 for plasma tnt median 1902 for plasma nt-probnb and indicated impending death median 0141 for serum tnt median 5375 for serum nt-probnp as compared with admission values median 00355 for serum tnt median 79690 for serum nt-probnp in the patients who died however no significant changes in tnt and nt-probnp were observed in survivors patients with elevated tnt developed frequent malignant arrhythmias and required more glucocorticoids 712 vs 511 and mechanical ventilation 596 vs 104 as compared to those with normal tnt levels the mortality rate of patients with and without the usage of acei or arb was 368 and 265 respectively these observations concluded that there is a significant association between myocardial injury and fatal outcome of covid-19 while the patients with underlying cvd without myocardial injury have a relatively favorable prognosis 43 figure 3 provides a summarized flowchart of all studies discussed above 24 29-43 discussion of case reports a few case reports have also depicted the distinctive involvement of the cardiovascular system in covid-19 infection the first case to report the cvm of covid-19 was presented by zeng et al 44 the article highlighted fulminant myocarditis as a complication of covid-19 in a 66-year-old patient with no known comorbidity who presented with fever cough dyspnea and chest tightness during hospitalization myocardial enzymes showed elevated tni 1137 gl myoglobin 39097 ngml and nt-probnp 22600 pgml electrocardiogram ecg showed sinus tachycardia with no st-segment elevation however an enlarged lv 61 mm diffuse myocardial dyskinesia along with low left ventricular ejection fraction lvef 32 pulmonary hypertension 44 mmhg and decreased inferior vena cava ivc collapse rate were noticed on bedside echocardiography severe pneumonia ards fulminant myocarditis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods were considered as differentials there was no improvement in the patients condition with supportive treatment the ventricular septum thickened to 14 mm and il-6 increased by 27240 pgml extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo was used to reduce the cardiopulmonary burden which showed a reduction in tni 010 gl nt-probnp 750 pgml and il-6 763 pgml the lvef gradually recovered to 68 and the lv and wall regained their normal thickness after treatment 44 inciardi et al highlighted cardiac involvement as a complication of covid-19 without symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia in a 53-year-old patient 45 ecg of this patient showed diffuse st elevation elevated hs-tnt and nt-probnp levels were also detected findings on chest radiography were normal cardiac mri showed increased wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis predominantly in the apical segments and severe lv dysfunction lvef of 35 short tau inversion recovery stir and t2-mapping sequences depicted marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema and a diffuse late gadolinium enhancement involving the entire biventricular wall a circumferential pericardial effusion especially around the right cardiac chambers was also observed these findings were consistent with acute myopericarditis and the patient was treated with dobutamine antiviral drugs steroids chloroquine and medical treatment for hf with progressive clinical and instrumental stabilization 45 similarly bilateral pericardial and pleural effusion as a complication of covid-19 infection has been reported by albarello et al 46 2019-ncov infection may also involve other organs like heart vessels liver and kidney as demonstrated by yao et al 47 the minimal invasive autopsies in three covid-19 cases revealed degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells the formation of hyaline thrombus in small vessels and pathological changes of chronic diseases in other organs and tissues while no evidence of coronavirus infection was observed in these organs the authors suggested conducting further studies to investigate the mechanism of underlying extra-pulmonary pathological changes of this disease 47 further cui et al highlighted multiple organ damage and rapid disease changes in a 55-day-old infant diagnosed with covid-19 pneumonia 48 laboratory investigations on the day of admission revealed mildly abnormal myocardial zymogens with altered liver function tests lfts with the deterioration of the patients condition an increase in tni 0025 gl was noticed which indicated myocardial injury intravenous sodium creatine phosphate was added to her regimen for the protection of her heart later the myocardial zymogen and liver function improved with supportive treatment and the patient was discharged 48 a summary of all the important findings of the aforementioned case reports is given in table 1 we can conclude that aci is common in covid-19 especially among adult males where it is regarded as a potential prognostic risk indicator higher levels of cytokines il cardiac injury markers such as troponin and ck and crp are usually appreciated in these patients consequently myocarditis ventricular dysfunction with or without pericardial effusion and subsequently hf cumulatively increase the mortality rate hence careful monitoring and immediate management plan to avoid or treat cardiac injuries are vital to achieving a decline in the number of deaths due to hf secondary to covid-19

of angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs mitigates or exacerbates sars-cov-2 infection remains unknown1 experts have postulated based on the effect of the drugs and the mechanism of virus entry that ace inhibitors and arbs could be beneficial harmful or have no effect on people infected with sars-cov-213 evaluations of the mechanism of action of these drugs also suggests differences between the outcomes of patients with ace inhibitors and arbs4 there is evidence from randomized controlled trials predating coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 suggesting a decrease in risk of all-cause pneumonia with ace inhibitors an effect not observed with arbs5 recent studies that have focused on the association of ace inhibitors and arbs with the risk of mortality among patients hospitalized with covid-19 suggest that these drugs are not harmful6 with some suggesting that ace inhibitors may reduce this risk of in-hospital death179 these studies were limited by their designs which lacked an active comparator47 moreover no large national study has addressed the association of these drugs with outcomes among individuals in the outpatient setting infected with sars-cov-2 the issue is important because these drugs are widely available and inexpensive and if beneficial could modify disease course and improve outcomes alternatively if they increase risk they could be compounding the harm caused by the virus accordingly we sought to conduct a large national study of the association of ace inhibitors and arbs with outcomes in patients with hypertension we specifically evaluated the association of the use of ace inhibitors and arbs among patients with hypertension so that we could have an active comparator other antihypertensive agents also to provide information about the association in inpatients we conducted a study of the association of ace inhibitors and arbs on mortality among people with hypertension who were hospitalized with covid-19 we stratified all our assessments by insurance groups due to substantial differences between the two populations we conducted 2 studies of patients with hypertension  the first study included individuals who tested positive for sars-cov-2 as an outpatient and the second included patients hospitalized with covid-19 in addition to a diagnosis of hypertension we prespecified our study population to include individuals that were receiving at least 1 antihypertensive agent further to account for medical comorbidities we created robust propensity score matched cohorts of patients treated with ace inhibitors arbs and other antihypertensive agents we evaluated the success of our matching algorithms through explicit assessments of covariate balance across all comparisons and evaluation of exposure groups on falsification endpoints due to systematic differences among enrollees in medicare advantage and commercial insurance programs and the enhanced risk of adverse outcomes with covid-19 among older individuals who are overrepresented in medicare1013 we evaluated the association of these drugs with outcomes in analyses stratified by insurance groups we used de-identified administrative claims for medicare advantage and commercially insured members in a research database from a single large us health insurance provider the database contains medical emergency inpatient outpatient and pharmacy claims for services submitted for third party reimbursement available as international classification of diseases tenth revision clinical modification icd-10-cm and national drug codes ndc claims respectively these claims are aggregated after completion of care encounters and submission of claims for reimbursement there were two additional data sources that included information on covid-19 and could be linked to the claims first the limited outpatient testing dataset included information on sars-cov-2 test results for members who underwent outpatient testing for sars-cov2 at 49 hospital-based free-standing outpatient and third-party labs in all states across the united states with over 90 of tests submitted by third-party lab vendors second the inpatient covid-19 dataset included a daily-updated record of covid-19 inpatient admissions for all insurance enrollees with claims information representing those admitted to a hospital with a primary or secondary diagnosis of covid-19 etable 1 along with their current disposition admitted discharged transferred expired or unknown we constructed cohorts of patients for each of the two studies first for the outpatient study we identified outpatients who tested positive for sars-cov-2 we included individuals at least 18 years of age with at least 6 months of enrollment in medicare advantage or commercial insurance from january through december 2019 and available claims data a diagnosis of hypertension in one or more claims and receiving one or more anti-hypertensive agents and tested positive for sars-cov-2 positive in an outpatient setting between march 6 2020 and may 3 2020 efigure 1 the medicare advantage and commercially insured individuals in the study represented all individuals with available claims in the unitedhealth groups clinical research database that satisfied the inclusion criteria we evaluated the association of ace inhibitors and arbs respectively on the risk of hospitalization in this outpatient cohort compared with patients on other antihypertensive medications second for the second inpatient study we identified an inpatient cohort of adults hospitalized with covid-19 this included all patients age 18 years with at least 6 months of health insurance enrollment in 2019 with available claims data a diagnosis of hypertension in one or more claims were receiving one or more anti-hypertensive agents and were hospitalized with a principal or secondary diagnosis of covid-19 between january 5 2020 and may 10 2020 efigure 2 we evaluated the association of ace inhibitors and arbs respectively on the mortality of hospitalized individuals in this cohort compared with patients on other antihypertensive medications for both studies a diagnosis of hypertension was based on icd-10 codes etable 1 and drug treatment for hypertension was defined by the receipt of one or more agents included in the 2017 american heart association hypertension guidelines14 these include first-line agents of ace inhibitors arbs thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics and dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as well as second-line agents of beta-adrenergic antagonists alpha blockers centrally acting alpha agonists loop diuretics potassium sparing diuretics mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and direct vasodilators individual drugs listed in etable 2 the information on the latter was derived from pharmacy claims and was defined by a cumulative supply greater than 30 days between july 1 2019 and december 31 2019 we identified 2 mutually exclusive exposure groups 1 patients receiving ace inhibitors and 2 those receiving arb with or without other agents we used an active comparator for these analyses that included all remaining patients with a diagnosis of hypertension who received one or more anti-hypertensive agents from drug classes other than ace inhibitor or arb these agents include all first and second line antihypertensive agents based on the 2017 aha guidelines for hypertension14 with the use of individual agents defined by one or more pharmacy claims for at least 30 days of medication supply for the agent between july and december 2019 in sensitivity analyses we restricted the control group to individuals receiving at least one first line anti-hypertensive agent from drug classes other than ace inhibitor or arb we combined information from inpatient and outpatient claims in 2019 to identify potential confounders of the association of the ace inhibitors and arb use and patient outcomes we included patient age sex race conditions that would represent potential indications for selective use of ace inhibitors or arbs diabetes myocardial infarction heart failure and chronic kidney disease and each of the additional comorbidities included in the charlson comorbidity index peripheral vascular disease cerebrovascular disease hemi- or paraplegia dementia chronic pulmonary disease rheumatologic disease diabetes with chronic complications malignancy metastatic solid tumor mild liver disease moderate-to-severe liver disease acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or human immunodeficiency virus the icd-10 codes corresponding to these variables are included in etable 1 appendix race was available only for medicare advantage members we included information on the total number of anti-hypertensive agents prescribed to patients using pharmacy claims finally regional clustering of cases was identified using location of sites submitting claims for laboratory testing for sars-cov-2 and hospital site for in-hospital outcomes in the outpatient study the primary outcome was inpatient hospitalization for covid-19 defined as a hospitalization with a principal or a secondary diagnosis of covid-19 in a linked inpatient dataset etable 1 we assessed mortality during this inpatient hospitalization as a secondary outcome in the inpatient study the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in addition we evaluated a secondary composite outcome of death or discharge to hospice and hospital length of stay in both outpatient and inpatient studies we created propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with hypertension treated with ace inhibitors arbs or other antihypertensive medications for this we constructed a non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model with receipt of ace inhibitors arb or other antihypertensive as the dependent variable for example we modeled the receipt ace inhibitor or another other anti-hypertensive excluding arb to determine each patients likelihood of receiving these agents based on their measured clinical characteristics we applied this strategy to different pairs of treatment comparisons ace inhibitor vs others arb vs others and ace inhibitor vs arb briefly we performed 11 matching between recipients based on propensity scores with a caliper width of one-tenth of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score4 we pursued 100 iterations to find the lowest mean absolute standardized difference among matched variables we matched our cohorts on age gender race insurance type conditions that may lead to selective use of ace inhibitors and arbs ie diabetes myocardial infarction heart failure and chronic kidney disease each of the comorbidities in the charlson comorbidity index and the number of anti-hypertensive agents used for the patient to account for regional clustering of care practices and response to the covid-19 pandemic we explicitly accounted for census region of lab testing site or inpatient facility in our models we evaluated the performance of propensity score matching using several strategies first we assessed the propensity score distributions in the unmatched and matched cohorts and calculated an equipoise metric to summarize the degree of overlap in characteristics of patients receiving these drugs1516 this represents the proportion of individuals in the unmatched groups that had a propensity score between 03 and 07 representing a state of equipoise between the two drugs a value greater than 05 implies two drugs are in empirical equipoise with a higher a value indicating a lower likelihood of confounding by indication15 next we evaluated the standardized difference between matched covariates before and after propensity score matching specifically we evaluated whether our matching algorithm achieved a standardized difference of 10 between matched cohort suggestive of adequately matched groups1617 second we evaluated the success of our matching algorithm using a priori defined negative control outcomes we chose two negative control or falsification endpoints  claims for gastroesophageal reflux disease and ingrown nail - that are unlikely to be affected by the treatment assignment and a directional effect would represent covariate imbalance16 third we evaluated whether our propensity matched cohort were also adequately matched on other therapeutic classes for non-antihypertensive agents that were not directly included in the matching algorithm these strategies were designed to evaluate the potential for residual confounding after creating propensity score matched cohorts finally we evaluated our observations for robustness by assessing treatment effects in 100 iterations of the propensity score matching algorithm evaluating whether our findings were consistent across these iterations that varied on the degree of matching of individual covariates we describe differences between patients treated with ace inhibitors and arbs compared with other anti-hypertensive agents and between those treated with ace inhibitors using chi square test for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables as the duration of follow up was expected to vary across individuals in both outpatient and inpatient covid-19 cohorts we evaluated their effects in time-to-event analyses with cox-proportional hazards models in both unadjusted and propensity score-matched cohorts to reduce bias from residual differences in matched covariates in our evaluation of patient outcomes we included the covariates included in our propensity score matching algorithm as independent variables in these models18 we repeated these analyses without this additional covariate adjustment for the outpatient study the index date was represented by the day of positive covid-19 test as an outpatient the period of the study was measured in days from the positive covid-19 and the outcome of interest was hospitalization for the inpatient study the index date was represented by the first day of hospitalization with covid-19 the period of the study was measured in days from admission and the outcome of interest was death since hospitalization could end with either patients death or being discharged alive we created a cause-specific cox proportional hazards model which is a competing risk

particularly with older age higher comorbidity burden and higher risk of covid-19 complications among medicare advantage enrollees we evaluated quantitative and qualitative interactions between insurance type and treatment groups for the assessment of our outcomes we also created propensity score-matched cohorts within the each of the two insurance subgroups analyses were performed using

propensity score matching algorithm found a lower risk of hospitalization with ace inhibitors across all iterations with a p-value of less than 005 in 97 of 100 iterations in the medicare advantage population in this first national study of ace inhibitors and arbs in outpatients testing positive for sars-cov-2 we found that overall these drugs did not confer additional risk or benefit however among those in medicare advantage ace inhibitors were associated with an almost 40 significantly lower risk of hospitalization for covid-19 an effect not observed with arbs among those hospitalized for covid-19 we did not find a benefit or a harm of these medications collectively the findings do not support a change to the current use of these medications but given the lack of effective therapies to mitigate the harm of the virus this study does provide a rationale for testing the use of ace inhibitors in older patients to reduce the risk of severe sars-cov-2 infection our design has several attributes that should provide confidence about the findings even though it is observational our study was restricted to people with hypertension who were receiving at least one anti-hypertensive agent thereby limiting our assessment to individuals receiving treatment for the same chronic illness and therefore equally likely to seek care for healthcare needs for covid-19 in all analyses we explicitly compared individuals with equipoise for receiving either drug treatment moreover we did not find any evidence of confounding by disease severity in choice of therapy in our assessment of a priori defined falsification endpoints further our study included individuals from across the united states thereby limiting the effect of hospital or regional care practices that may bias an evaluation of treatment effects our observations extends the prior evidence of supporting safety of ace inhibitor treatment in covid-1947922 we show the safety of these agents in outpatient sars-cov-2 infected individuals which complements the studies of those who were hospitalized4722 also ours is a national study which complements the single center or single region studies23 our study does have an intriguing finding in the subgroup of individuals enrolled in medicare advantage we find that ace inhibitors were associated with a significantly lower risk of hospitalization following an infection with sars-cov-2 in the outpatient setting these patients are older more frequently have comorbidities and were more vulnerable to severe covid-19 disease47 these findings are particularly relevant as the medicare advantage group represented over 90 of all covid-19 hospitalizations in our inpatient cohort also interestingly we did not find the same association for arbs despite clinical equipoise in the use of these drugs our findings are consistent with prior evidence from randomized clinical trials that a reduced risk of pneumonia with ace inhibitors that is not observed with arb5 our study of in-hospital outcomes adds to the literature on studies that have reached contrasting conclusions regarding the role of ace inhibitor therapy and in-hospital mortality among hospitalized covid-19 patients we did not find a significant association with mortality consistent with others that have not found such an association42324 however our findings contrast with certain studies that have found lower mortality in hospitalized covid-19 patients treated with ace inhibitors722 notably the studies that have evaluated mortality risk with covid-19 before have not consistently been designed to detect potential causal association of drug therapy with outcomes7 relied on case control designs22 pursued potentially biased assessment by using comparators not receiving any therapy47 or are based on data from single health centers423 moreover some have studied both ace inhibitors and arbs together despite potentially different mechanisms and effects on patient outcomes5 there some rationale for why there may be a specific ace inhibitor effect there is preclinical evidence that suggests a possible protective role for ace inhibitors in covid-19 ace inhibitors but not arbs are associated with the upregulation of ace-2 receptors325 these receptors modulate the local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system interactions in the lung tissue26 the presence of ace2 receptors therefore exerts a protective effect against the development of acute lung injury in infections with sars coronaviruses which lead to dysregulation of these mechanisms and endothelial damage2728 further our observations do not support a theoretical concerns of adverse outcomes due to enhanced virulence of sars coronaviruses due to overexpression of ace2 receptors in cell cultures  an indirect binding site for these virues29 however the pathophysiological effects of ace inhibitors in sars-cov2 infection and the development of clinical disease are likely complex and require dedicated investigation our study has important implications for 4 ongoing randomized trials as none of them align with the observations of our study6 of the 4 trials 3 are testing the use of ace inhibitors or arbs in the treatment of hospitalized covid-19 patients and 1 is using a 10-day course of arbs after a positive sars-cov-2 test to prevent hospitalization6 however our study suggests that the most appropriate strategy to test in a trial would be the prophylactic use of ace inhibitor to prevent hospitalization which is not being tested in any current study the findings of our study should be interpreted in light of the following limitations first the study is observational and despite robust methods and explicit assessments of residual confounding understanding the potential protective role of ace inhibitors in covid-19 requires a dedicated randomized controlled trial second we do not know the proportion of patients receiving these antihypertensive agents that continued to be treated with these drugs during the illness and the association of their continued use or cessation with patient outcomes third all included data elements are contingent upon individuals seeking care for that ailment or filling a medication using their insurance provider and would not be captured if they chose to self-pay however we do not expect that any sizeable proportion of insured individuals would defer insurance coverage for their care fourth we cannot account for differences in timing of presentation of patients relative to their symptom onset however we limited the effect of differential presentation by patients across exposure groups by focusing on patients receiving treatment for the same medical comorbidity ie hypertension and only varying the class of drugs moreover we included patients across the us and accounted for clustering of patients thereby limiting the effect of local practice patterns that may affect hospitalization thresholds therefore it is unlikely patients care seeking behavior would be affected by knowledge of their underlying disease finally while our analyses of hospitalization use all available evidence for disease severity we do not have granular details on real-time inpatient treatment of patients with covid-19 and whether certain presentation or care characteristics are associated with in-hospital outcomes instead our study evaluates the association of only pre-hospital factors with patient outcomes during hospitalization in conclusion the use of ace inhibitors and arbs was not associated with the risk of hospitalization or mortality among those infected with sars-cov-2 however there was a nearly 40 lower risk of hospitalization with the use of ace inhibitors in the medicare population this finding merits a clinical trial to evaluate the potential role of ace inhibitors in reducing the risk of hospitalization among older individuals who are at an elevated risk of adverse outcomes with the infection  covid-19 and arterial hypertension hypothesis or evidence investigations reported that hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular diseases were the most prevalent comorbidities among the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 hypertension appeared consistently as the most prevalent risk factors in covid-19 patients some investigations speculated about the association between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas and susceptibility to covid-19 as well as the relationship between raas inhibitors and increased mortality in these patients this raised concern about the potential association between hypertension and its treatment and propensity for covid-19 there are only a few follow-up studies that investigated the impact of comorbidities on outcome in these patients with conflicting findings hypertension has been proven to be more prevalent in patients with an adverse outcome admission in intensive care unit use of mechanical ventilation or death so far there is no study that demonstrated independent predictive value of hypertension on mortality in covid-19 patients there are many speculations about this coronavirus and its relation with different risk factors and underlying diseases the aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge about the relationship between hypertension and covid-19 and the role of hypertension on outcome in

compared to other antihypertensive treatment hypertension is the leading cause of mortality globally 312 of adults were estimated to have hypertension worldwide in 2010 24 since the emerge of sars-cov-2 infection hypertension has been frequently observed as a major comorbidity in covid-19 patients 2 17 20 21 22 we reported here that 272 126 of 462 of the covid-19 patients admitted to

median age of 47 and 48 years respectively compared to 67 years from our report covid-19 patients with hypertension appeared to have a higher death rate and were more frequently seen in severe cases 17 we also examined the death rate and the incidence of critical cases in our cohort compared with non-hypertension controls covid-19 patients with hypertension had a higher death rate  14 of 125  but these differences failed to reach statistical significance however we did find that patients remained in hospital had a significantly longer disease course in covid-19 patients with hypertension than those without 367124 vs 31677 p0024 therefore our results together with those from other groups provided ample evidence that hypertension is a critical risk factor for the poor clinical outcome of covid-19 patients indeed this notion was further supported by laboratory testing results covid-19 patients with hypertension had much lower blood oxygen index p0001 as well as higher blood urea p0020 and alt p0022 than those without hypertension the mechanisms by which hypertension results in the poor clinical outcome of covid-19 remain obscure we found that compared with non-hypertension controls covid-19 patients with hypertension have markedly increased levels of inflammatory hs-crp p0024 procalcitonin p0017 and il-6 p0017 suggesting that dysregulated inflammatory response might contribute

with non-arbsaceis arbsaceis treatment also resulted in a lower death rate and less critical cases in these patients we did not find the concentrations of il-6 in the arbsaceis group to be significantly different from that in the non-arbsaceis controls which suggests that arbsaceis treatment alone might not be efficient in modulating the production of this cytokine however combining of arbsaceis and il-6r blockade could presumably have a synergic effect in regulating the elevated inflammatory response in covid-19 patients with preexisting hypertension which could be tested in future

medrxiv preprint affinity than that bind to sars-cov this finding together with the fact that people from different races with different ages and sexes were all susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection suggest that physiological expression of ace2 may be already sufficient for sars-cov-2 infection and further upregulation might not increase the risk arbs and aceis are both antihyperhensive drugs discovered to maintain the blood pressure thus arbsaceis treatment could result in hypotension in healthy subjects which may prevent their application in covid-19 patients without hypertension alternatively novel therapeutic options using ace2 as target will be promising in treating sars-cov-2 infection without affecting blood pressure our study has several limitations first due to the retrospective nature of this study and the fact that it was conducted in a single hospital interpretation of our findings might be limited by the sample size and selection bias we also realize that there are additional risk factors may not be well-controlled despite as many confounders as possible were corrected for nevertheless as far as we know this is the largest retrospective cohort study designed to examine the usage of arbsaceis and its effect on covid-19 patients with preexisting hypertension second the severity and disease course were not identical among these patients which resulted in the difficulty in collecting laboratory indicators at the same time point we therefore selected the most extreme values beyond the normal range of laboratory indicators that could reflect the severity of condition for comparison however this strategy might still cause biases in presenting laboratory indicators third the expression of ace2 and other inflammatory factors were not determined in this study due to the sample availability and limited technical resources in our hospital this limitation prevented us from further exploring all rights reserved no reuse allowed without

hypertension has been reported to be the leading coexisting illness of covid-19 patients and these patients were frequently treated with arbsaceis to control their blood pressure  the effects of arbsaceis on the pathogenesis of covid-19 has yet to be defined  we conducted the first and the largest case series to evaluate the effect of arbsaceis on the pathogenesis of covid-19 patients with preexisting hypertension  we found that without increasing the risk for sars-cov-2 infection arbsaceis outcompeted other antihypertensive drugs in containing exaggerate inflammatory response and curbing disease progression in covid-19 patients with preexisting hypertension our results support the use of arbsaceis over other antihypertensive drugs in treating covid-19 patients with preexisting hypertension large prospective studies are required to confirm this finding and to explore the mechanisms by which arbsaceis regulate the inflammatory response and prevent disease progression all
