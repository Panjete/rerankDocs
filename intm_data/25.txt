 the rapid spread to more than 25 other countries across the world centers of disease control and prevention 2020 and the high number of contagions over 70 000 in only 1 month after the first case report on december 31 2019 is alarming for all the worlds human populations httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019 although the fatality rate of sarscov2 is around 4 lower than previous sarscov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and merscov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus who has highlighted the importance of strengthening collaborative efforts among scientists to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing the epidemic

 coronaviruses belong to the family coronaviridae and are characterized by a positivesense singlestranded rna genome that was released via the community online resource virologicalorg on 10 january wuhanhu1 genbank accession number mn908947 after that four other genomes were deposited on 12 january in the viral sequence database of the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid the genome sequence showed that the virus is closely related to the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome sars agent of the 200203 outbreak of sars in humans this virus family includes a large number of viruses present in rhinolophid bats in both europe and asia these viruses are pathogen of animals such as birds and mammals in humans they typically induce mild respiratory infections generally observed in the common colda workflow of the coronavirus primary screening has been shown in figure 1 a reliable diagnosis of the viral infection is one the most urgent priorities for public health management of the disease spread usually in acute respiratory infection rtpcr is traditionally employed to identify viruses in respiratory secretions a robust detection technology is usually based on realtime rtpcr because it is highly sensitive and specific although it requires infrastructure skilled personnel and at least 46 hours for analysis currently available techniques do not provide results before several hours or even days and the tests require a wellequipped laboratory and trained personnel indeed these methods are not efficient to rapidly screen a high number of individuals in places where thousands of people transit per hours these methods are effective in confirming the infections when symptoms are already present but they are completely inefficient to identify infections at asymptomatic stage the development of a means for a quick and simple detection of this virus in humans is a worldwide priority considering that infections have been observed in world areas such as africa where the scarce health assistance will not be able to control the spread indeed it is important to generate new ideas that will allow the development of new detection prototypes able to quickly identify infected humans and prevent the virus from spreadinga large number of possible hostpathogen biomarkers transcripts mirnas proteins metabolites may be analyzed through different omic tools here we propose the application of a portable instrument based on the analysis of molecular responses at transcript level the proposed approach consists in the adaptation of an existing infield portable technology currently used for realtime detection of viral agents in plants for detection of sarscov2 in confined and contaminated environments for example airports buildings and boats it links translational genomics to technologies potentially enhancing the discovery of sarscov2specific biomarkers while bridging gaps in conventional human virus detection and molecular diagnostics methods an analysis at two complementary levels host transcriptional responses and viral nucleic acid presence may allow clarification of the pathogenetic mechanisms of the viral agent identifying strict and complex causeeffect relationships occurring in the hostpathogen interactions traditional approaches are based on pathogen dnarna and protein detection using respectively pcrbased or proteinbased methods in traditional laboratory instruments however this kind of method is not useful in the quest to reduce the spread of sarscov2 infections because a the virus is not uniformly distributed within human tissues and is therefore often missed when at low titers undetectable with current realtime pcr technologies b the virus has high incubation times 1430 days at asymptomatic conditions having the capability to be highly contagious at this stage c the analysis with traditional methods takes time for sample transport extraction and analysis 1624 hours at least reducing the speed of viral spread counteracting actions and d the need of skilled personnel to perform analysis the proposed strategy is focused on the analysis of human responses that are triggered during viral infection with specific emphasis on the immune responses that are upregulated rapidly after infection and are locally at the site of infection nose nostrils and also at a distance lungs and other organs biomarkers that are associated with such responses can be found both locally and at certain distance from nostrils at the earlystage event of the hostpathogen interaction a stress condition typically occurs such as a inflammatory response due to the activation of recognition mechanisms of pathogenassociated and pathogeninduced virulence factors these early asymptomatic responses are typically linked with changes in both host and the viral agent at transcriptional and the posttranscriptional levels with specific mrna mirna noncoding rna proteins and metabolites activated in response to the pathogen presencethrough the comparison of transcriptomic signatures under asymptomatic and symptomatic conditions genes associated with the beginning of disease symptoms can be identified the molecular processes precede symptoms appearance when human host activate more physiological responses leading to diseaseassociated phenotypic modifications and metabolic problems linked to pathogen virulence factors the human response itself may lead to detrimental effects exaggerating the direct pathogen action or inducing mutually negative actions prevention of sarscov2 disease spread may require a development of portable instruments for rapid easy and reliable detection of viral infections at a presymptomatic stage b development therapeutic methods for destruction of sarscov2 before irreversible negative effects on human health has occurred these approaches may focus on targeting of human immune system and c identification of pathways and bioactive compounds that can stimulate the innate immune responses indeed the proposed approach is to identify and analyze biomarkers modulated in either host or pathogen at early stages of infection when any eukaryotic host is subjected to stress an induced stress response occurs similarly to the host inflammatory response to pathogenassociated and pathogeninduced virulence factors

 if the induced stress response is enhanced tissue injury can happen causing to irreversible effects at asymptomatic stages because it is often too late to avoid tissue and organ damages once symptoms appear during the early stages of this condition the induction of immune stressrelated genes and pathways commonly associated with pathogen infection and physiological disorders occur and these genes are typically associated with general early state of stress response other differentially regulated genes at the presymptomatic stage are stress specific and may work as useful biomarkers for the early diagnosis of the host health conditions these responses include changes in the key metabolic pathways associated with key indicators of early stages of infection of known pathogens usually this stress condition usually anticipates the manifestation of symptoms associated with diseases for this reason a focus on the analysis of key genes transcripts proteins metabolites or pathways could be used to monitor the human health status these induced biological molecules may be used as biomarkers for both stress identification and recovery the identification of molecules that are early host responses associated in a reversible stress status using portable instruments is the first stage for asymptomatic diagnosis the biomarkers identification needs the analysis of large data sets through webbased applications that queries large public databases of information on transcripts proteins or metabolites modulated in specific biological conditions ie genevestigatorhere we propose the employment of an instrument that is already widely used for plant pathogens

 and could be easily adapted also for the detection of sarscov2 the idea is to use a portable dnabased detection devices not only targeting viral rna but also analyze a pool of early responsive host transcripts this transcriptional fingerprint would greatly enhance early asymptomatic detection of a viral such as sarscov2 having more than 14 days of asymptomatic stage this complementary approach on host and pathogen will overcome the limits of an approach aiming at only target the pathogen dna that is unreliable at asymptomatic stage especially in case of pathogen with systemic diffusion such as viruses a molecular analysis of early human responses may complement traditional methods based on the identification of the pathogen presence enhancing the detection of first infections at asymptomatic stage surely the expression analysis of a single gene of any host does not allow the specific diagnose of infections because there are no host genes strictly specific for a specific pathogen however a pool of responsive host genes might be employed as host biomarkers to quickly identify early alarm stress state better than aspecific methods currently used such the measurement of body temperature for fever detection a biomarker can be defined as a biological characteristic that can be analyzed and considered as an indicator of a particular physiological such as pathogenic processes or responses to a therapeutic intervention in omic sciences a biomarker profile includes a series of transcriptomic proteomic andor metabolomic features linked with a particular stress development of physiological condition combined these characteristics could become a biomarker of pathogenic condition assisting in diagnosis and therapy a systemsbased approach could gain insight into underlying biological regulatory network brn governing interactions between hosts and pathogens heterogeneous omic data sets could be integrated to define a biological regulatory network underlying early host and pathogen biomarkers for asymptomatic detection of the viral infections to assist the biomarkers discovery the vast amount of transcriptomic data available in public databases in response to human coronaviruses will allow a deep metaanalysis using previously customized bioinformatics pipelines ref 8 9 10 11 this work consists of reanalyzing raw data obtained by independent experiments using a normalization and standardization procedure included in a bioinformatics pipeline this work will provide differentially regulated genes from each study finding commonalities and differences in genes genet sets pathways and geneprotein networks to clarify molecular mechanisms in hostpathogen interactions

the genome sequence of sarscov2 is closely related to that of sarscov like sarscov and merscov sarscov2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus

13
 having a genome size of 30 kilobases similarly with the other coronaviruses encoding for multiple structural and nonstructural proteins

 in addition sarscov2 seems to have similar cell entry mechanism and type of human cell receptor

 t cells respond well against the structural proteins that are most immunogenic compared to the nonstructural proteins
18
 among them the s and n proteins have showed to be the most dominant and longlasting by tcell responses
19
 indeed as possible targets for pathogen nucleic acid detection for bcube we may suggest the following proteins including spike s proteins envelope e proteins membrane m proteins and nucleocapsid n proteins no mutation in sarscov2 sequences as of february 6 2020 has been observed in comparison with the experimentally determined sarscovderived bcell epitopes both linear and discontinuous implying that these epitopes have the potential to elicit a crossreactiveeffective responses against sarscov2
20
 indeed as host response targets we may suggest to test ifn tnf il2 as suggested by previous data

 indeed s peptides showed the highest percentages of ifn producing cellsproteomics may be also used to validate the discovery of transcriptional markers analyzing the same infection stages considered at transcript level a possible technique could be the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation itraq typically employed in quantitative proteomics using tandem mass spectrometry to analyze quantitative measurements of protein amount from different sources in a single experiment briefly once proteins are extracted from the same collected tissues nostril tissues they may be precipitated using proteoextracttm protein precipitation kit calbiochem dehydrated resuspended and digested with tripsin and generated peptides analyzed using a system composed by qexactive mass spectrometer an easylc and a nanospray ionization source data could be acquired using a datadependent msms method and raw data should be analyzed using xtandem visualized using scaffold proteome software and proteins identified using uniprot databases and crap database the use of proteomics should enable identification not only viral proteins but also host proteins modulated by early infection at the same way of transcriptomics a complement approach hostpathogen is required some of the identified pathogen virulence proteins may be selected for further validation through expression in model animals to validate their virulence phenotype synthetic virulence genes should be designed to insure higher in vivo expression through codons optimization ie using dnaworks software httpmcl1ncifcrfgovdnaworks signal peptides could be analyzed by signalp 40 server and nglycosylation sites could be predicted using netnglyc10 httpwwwcbsdtudkservicesnetnglyc this approach has been successful to determine more than 4500 proteins in plants including both host and pathogen

 considering the systemic presence of sarscov2 the identification of specific genes from peripheral blood and different tissues would be very helpful to discover tissuespecific host biomarkers the viral infection is typically perceived by the host before that the viral nucleic acid can be detected by traditional methods such as quantitative realtime pcrhere we propose the use of the portable device such as bcube20 developed by hyris ltdthe device is a miniaturized device that is able to perform both temperature cycles and isothermal analysis enabling a wide array of nucleic acid detection methods such as qpcr and isothermal amplifications figure 2 with a power consumption of maximum 60 w the instrument runs custom thermal cycling protocols and performs realtime pcr analyses the instrument sized 100  100  120 mm with a weight of 115 kg is certified to both european and north american standards thanks to a live sync to a central database it can be monitored and controlled remotely from any device or in mobile with a smartphone the analysis can be performed using customized cartridges to analyze in multiplex way up to 16 or 36 samples of 1025 l in one run on two detection channels famhexthe key features of this system are the following
viral detection in 15 hours using rtpcrautomatic result interpretationhigh resolution melting and isothermal amplification optionswireless or wired connectivity
the bcube 20 can be controlled by the hyris bapp a multiplatform gui that works on smartphones tablets laptops and pcs with typical operating systems figure 3 key features are the following

this miniaturized instrument has been recently proposed for highly threatening pathogen outbreak in agriculture such as xylella fastidiosa in olive

 the instrument has typically been used for the detection of plant viral infections directly in field the novelty is the possibility to use the detection principles and methodologies from the infield detection of plant virus in crops to quick and portable detection of a dangerous viral agent in humans such as sarscov2 the instrument analyzes mrna in 2 hours directly in the field without the need of laboratory infrastructures through the performance of a qrtpcr analysis gene expression could be conducted collecting samples from human nostrils with tools such as cotton swabs confirmation may be performed blood samples rna may be extracted from these collection instruments with a quick procedure using simplified extraction proceduresthe typical workflow for the use of the instrument for pathogen detection is shown in figure 4 results may be provided in approximately 2 hours at the moment the developed software and hardware are used to target the pathogen dna but a next step could be the analysis of host xfregulated genes discovered by metaanalysis works implementation and validation tests of the results obtained directly by the portable device could be conducted analyzing the same tissues with traditional laboratory equipment this work would verify the consistency of the field results delivered by the instrumentthe proposed instrument fits well when a quick easy reliable and inhouse early detection and confirmation is required to rapidly decontaminate environments and initiate quarantine of infected individuals the workflow for a secondary coronavirus screening using bcube is shown in figure 5
 the system is able to detect not only viruses but also specific bacteria proteins and dna molecules an increased or reduced concentration of which in a persons saliva blood and other tissues ie nostrils provide the diagnosis of the sarscov2 infections the most important aspect of this tool is the extreme ease of use and the automatic interpretation of the results the app has an intuitive interface and can guide the operator through every step of the setup and analysis initiation in the analysis is simple and the automatic result interpretation engine can assist the operator in determining the outcome the supplied power source works at both 110 v and 220 v and the power cord can be easily interchanged with the one compatible with the standard of your destination country realtime and remote control of the bcubes is allowed thanks to the connection to hyris bdata service the instrument is well suitable to work on boats and other quarantine environments for the possibility to have results in short time it also fits well in the airports after a quick scan of other symptoms ie fever in order to confirm the presence of the viral infectionswe certify that lorenzo colombo stefano lo priore isabella della noce and simone romano are employees of hyris ltd that produces the bcube instrument described in this articleon december 2019 wuhan city in china became the epicentre of unexplained cases of pneumonia on january 2020 chinese scientists identified this as a novel coronavirus temporarily labelled as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1 its name was then changed to coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization in february 2020 as the disease spread worldwide 2it has been suggested the outbreak has a zoonotic origin and like other respiratory pathogens it spreads through human-to-human transmission such as coughing and sneezing 3 although limited research suggests a possibility of transmission even among the asymptomatic 4as of the 28th april 2020 over 200 countries have been affected by the covid-19 disease with over three million confirmed cases leading to over 200000 deaths yet it is believed many remain unreported in certain areas of the world 1infected patients may present with any of the following fever high temperature 373 c cough myalgia sputum production headache haemoptysis diarrhoea dyspnoea and in some cases acute respiratory distress syndrome ards acute cardiac injury or secondary infection 5upon examination these subjective clinical symptoms can be interpreted more confidently with the use of biological markers biomarkers these provide objective values throughout the progression of the disease 6 henceforth categorising patients into mild severe or critical becomes more defined allowing for earlier interventions 7this article aims to explore the role of different biomarkers in the disease pathogenesis of covid-19 and assess how their levels vary depending on the severity of the disease by doing so it gives clinicians a tool to group patients and predict prognosis and mortality the biomarkers we review include c-reactive protein crp il-6 white cell count wcc lactate dehydrogenase ldh d-dimers platelet count cardiac troponin and renal markersa comprehensive literature search was done on pubmed scopus embase cochrane database google scholar and ovid to identify articles discussing biomarkers in this review and its clinical implications on covid-19 in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis prisma guidelines key words used were c-reactive protein covid-19 interleukin-6 lactate dehydrogenase sars white cell count neutrophil count lymphocyte count d-dimer platelet count cardiac troponin renal biomarkers urea creatinine the search terms were used as key words and in combination as mesh terms to maximize the output from literature findings a staged literature search was done whereby a separate literature search was performed for each section within this article and all the relevant studies were identified and summarized separately if a paper reports on multiple biomarker then the results have been shared between different parts of this review the relevant articles are cited and referenced within each section separately no limit has been placed on publication time or language of the article all the relevant articles were identified and screened by three authors the results are summarized in narrative manner in each relevant section of this review a summary table of each section is provided where appropriatestudies were included if they have reviewed a correlation between a biomarker and the severity of covid-19 exclusion criteria were editorials consensus documents commentaries and studies with no particular definition of the role of biomarkers in covid-19all articles were screened by two authors and any disagreement was reached by consensus or involvement of third author data extracted by two authors and validated by third authorquality of each publication was evaluated by two independent reviewers this review addressed key domains type of biomarker level of the biomarker correlation with severity of the disease survival number of patients investigated and outcomesit was not possible to conduct an appropriate meta-analysis because there were not enough research data among the studies on this subjectcrp is a plasma protein produced by the liver and induced by various inflammatory mediators such as il-6 despite being non-specific this acute phase reactant is used clinically as a biomarker for various inflammatory conditions a rise in crp levels are associated with an increase in disease severity 7the application of crp in covid-19 has been highlighted by a retrospective single-centre study in wuhan china where the majority of patients in the severe cohort showed significantly higher levels compared to the non-severe cohort 579 mgl vs 332 mgl p  0001 8 a second retrospective cohort study found the likelihood of progressing to severe covid-19 disease increased in patients with crp levels 418 mgl 9 both studies suggest crp levels are a strong indicator to reflect the presence and severity of covid-19 infectionfurthermore a study from unpublished observations suggests crp is one of the first biomarkers within blood plasma that changes to reflect physiological complications if accepted crp will be the most effective biomarker to predict the progression of covid-19 infection contrastingly the same study illustrated some cases of infection which showed changes in serum amyloid a saa instead of evoking significant crp changes thus requiring further evaluation 10whilst the use of saa as a biomarker for covid-19 requires further research crp and saa are commonly used in conjunction to monitor inflammatory diseases though saa is another acute phase reactant it is responsive to both viral and bacterial infections compared to crp 11pathologically computed tomography ct scans can identify lung lesions relating to covid-19 nonetheless a study conducted in china revealed ct scores could not differentiate mild cases from severe however compared to erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr crp levels were significantly greater during early periods of severe cases and proved to be a more sensitive biomarker in reflecting disease development 12the excellent performance of crp as a biomarker is reflected in the area under curve in the receiver operating analysis of 087 95 ci 010100 where values 83 and 91 represent sensitivity and specificity respectively hence compared to ct scans alone crp values are more reliable for earlier identification of case severity 12 table 2
summarises the studies used in analysing crp and covid-19cytokine release syndrome crs is an over-exaggerated immune response involving an overwhelming release of pro-inflammatory mediators this mechanism underlies several pathological processes including acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 13 studies investigating the role of cytokines in sars and mers have had also found a link between crs and disease severity 14 understanding their role in covid-19 disease may help facilitate the design of novel immunotherapiesstudies have revealed that levels of il-6 the most common type of cytokine released by activated macrophages rise sharply in severe manifestations of covid-19 15 however since most studies to date have been observational it is difficult to extrapolate if the rise is significant enough to cause the manifestations seen in severe formsone meta-analysis reviewing six studies show mean il-6 concentrations were 29-fold higher in patients with complicated covid-19 compared to those with non-complicated disease n  1302 95 ci 117719 16 in its analysis the outcomes of the studies include icu admission onset of ards and mortality since the proportionate rise of il-6 is correlated with disease severity this study can prove ground-breaking although clinicians can use this to identify severity earlier and commence oxygen therapy sooner the varying outcomes makes it somewhat difficult to ascertain what level of il-6 corresponds to what negative outcome furthermore many studies recruited participants from the same centre giving rise to the potential of selection bias table 3
summarises the studies used in analysing il-6 and covid-19white blood cells wbcs known as leucocytes are a component of blood generated from bone marrow and lymphoid tissue they are divided into two major groups granulocytes and agranulocytes within the granulocyte group are eosinophils basophils and neutrophils nc whereas lymphocytes lc and monocytes are present in agranulocytes a disproportionate number of these cells may reveal an underlying infection and hence can be measured using blood tests producing a wcc however the reliability of wcc as a biomarker for covid-19 remains unprovena retrospective study found several differences in wcc between severe and non-severe covid-19 patients 8 both groups experienced an increase in leucocytes with the severe group having a significantly greater rise 56 vs 49  109l p  0001 ncs were predominantly driving this increase as the severe set 43 vs 32  109l p  0001 interestingly the levels of lymphocytes monocytes basophils and eosinophils were less resulting in a greater neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio nlr 55 vs 32 p  0001 nlr is an infamous biomarker high in wide-spread inflammatory conditions and can be used to reflect disease severity however a larger study is needed to clarify nlrs effectiveness as a biomarkeranother conducted in china concludes similar findings of high nc and low lc count in severely affected patients suggesting nlr could be a potential biomarker for early detection of severe covid-19 17however other factors may disrupt the accuracy of the wcc results observed these include glucocorticoid therapy and other underlying viralbacterial infections 11lc is separately addressed in the literature secondary to nlr a descriptive study in china reported depleted lc levels in the majority of covid-19 patients 15another study has found low blood lymphocyte percentage lym in critically ill patients suggesting low lc count indicates poor prognosis however since the virus can target lymphoid tissue and mechanisms of il-6 other causes of low lc count must be investigated 18 similar to nlr the clinical benefits of lc count as a biomarker for covid-19 remains uncertain

summarises the studies used in analysing wcc and covid-19in glucose metabolism the enzyme ldh converts pyruvate to lactate ldh secretion is triggered by necrosis of the cell membrane hinting to viral infection or lung damage such as the pneumonia induced by sars-cov-2 19 there is convincing evidence linking ldh levels to the development of covid-19 disease 20a study found significantly higher levels of ldh in icu patients than non-icu patients 248 ul vs 151 ul p0002 since high levels of ldh continued in the icu patients number of days post-admission 160 ul vs 218 ul p0002 ldh may be a predictive biomarker of severe disease however the one centre study may be prone to selection bias which could potentially reduce its validity 21a multi-centre study involving 1099 patients reported supporting evidence correlating extent of tissue damage and inflammation with increasing levels of ldh 22 furthermore when ldh levels were correlated with ct scans significantly higher levels reflected the severity of pneumonia 23there is increasing confidence in using ldh as a biomarker to measure severity of covid-19 infection another study found that there was a significant rise in ldh levels among refractory covid-19 patients 24
table 5
summarises the studies used in analysing ldh and covid-19d-dimer originate from the lysis of cross-linked fibrin with rising levels indicating the activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis 25 early studies have associated covid-19 with haemostatic abnormalities with one study observing elevated levels of d-dimer the measure of coagulation in non-survivors compared to survivors 26a retrospective cohort study composed of 191 patients found that d-dimer levels 10 gml p00033 were associated with increased mortality among covid-19 patients furthermore they found that levels of 20 gml or more on admission was the optimum cut-off to predict in-hospital mortality for covid-19 27 studies have reported that nearly 90 of inpatients with pneumonia had increased coagulation activity marked rising d-dimer levels 28furthermore huang et al found that levels of d-dimer on admission could be used to triage patients into critical care 5 the researchers found that median d-dimer levels were higher in icu patients compared to non-icu patients 24 mgl vs 05 mgl p00042 this along with the previous study suggests that d-dimer levels can be used as a prognostic marker and help clinicians monitor those who are likely to deteriorate earlier however this study confirmed the diagnosis of covid-19 using lower respiratory tract specimens and did not use paired nasopharyngeal swabs to investigate the viral rna detection rate between the upper and lower respiratory tract specimens secondly with a cohort size of 41 patients it is difficult to assess predictors of disease severity and mortality with multivariable-adjusted methods

summarises the studies used to analyse d-dimer and covid-19as seen with previous coronavirus outbreaks covid-19 infection leads to severe haematological changes leading to thrombocytopeniameta-analysis of 1799 patients reveal those with severe covid-19 infections had significantly lower platelet counts wmd 31  109l 95 ci 35 to 29  109l 29 when using mortality as an endpoint non-survivors evidently had a significantly lower platelet count wmd 48  109l 95 ci 57 to 39  109l using thrombocytopenia as an endpoint also revealed a fivefold greater risk of covid-19 or 513 95 ci 1811458 despite the varying definitions of disease severity and thrombocytopenia having an influence on results analysis platelet count could possibly be used clinically to indicate infection severitya retrospective study which used cox proportional hazard regression analysis found that platelet count is an independent risk factor for mortality among covid-19 patients where a 50  109l increase is associated with 40 deceased mortality hr 060 95ci 043 084 30 here thrombocytopenia at admission was more likely to occur in non-survivors than in survivors although many risk factors were accounted for in this study the possibility for unmeasured confounder cannot be excludedanother study corroborates the previously documented work the nadir platelet count was significantly associated with mortality  and the lower the nadir the stronger the association 31 again thrombocytopenia was more likely to occur in non-survivors than survivors this study is from adequate sample sizes providing statistical power however similar to the previous studies they are all retrospective making the correlation seen difficult to extrapolate fromtesting the platelet count is a routine part of laboratory tests and the literature suggests it has inherent value in providing more detail on the patients condition
table 7
summarises the studies used in analysing platelet count and covid-19there is growing evidence of higher mortality rates among those with underlying cardiovascular disease due to covid-19 infection 22 some have investigated the use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i hs-tni as a marker of disease progression and mortalitya retrospective study performed in china of patients with confirmed covid-19 based on sars-cov-2 rna detection revealed a univariable odds ratio for death at 801 95 ci 1036204 p00001 for hs-tni 32 this risk was higher compared to other biomarkers such as d-dimer and lymphocyte count another study of 416 hospitalised patients with covid-19 reported that hs-tni was elevated in 1 in 5 patients on presentation 33 these patients were more likely to require invasive 22 vs 4 p0001 or non-invasive 46 vs 4 p0001 ventilation develop ards 59 vs 15 p0001 or acute kidney injury 9 vs 0 p0001early recognition of myocardial injury indicated by elevated hs-tni aids in appropriate triage to a critical care area and informs the use of inotropes and vasopressors however elevated levels are common in hospitalised patients and are likely to be due to non-ischaemic causes of myocardial injury this may lead to inappropriate use of cardiology consultation and downstream testing and increased risk to cardiac physiology staff
table 8
summarises the studies used in analysing hs-tni and covid-19there is also evidence that chronic kidney disease is associated with severe forms of covid-19 infection 34studies have demonstrated significantly higher levels of renal biomarkers such as serum urea creatinine and markers of glomerular filtration rate in severe cases 35 since these results stem from the analysis of 28 patients extrapolation across larger cohorts is more difficulta larger study of 701 patients revealed that elevated serum creatinine levels on admission correlated with severity due to significant abnormalities in the coagulation pathway 36 they also found that these patients were more likely to require mechanical ventilation or be placed in intensive care univariate cox regression analysis found elevated creatinine levels was also associated with in-hospital mortality hr 299 95 ci 200 447 proteinuria haematuria and elevated urea levels had similar if not larger hazard ratiosinterestingly another study showed a potential role for urinalysis over serum markers of kidney function 37 here abnormalities in the routine urine test on admission correlated strongly with disease severity they go on to suggest that urinalysis may reveal kidney impairment more readily than evaluation of serum renal biomarkers however these tests were only carried out on admission and so patients in earlier stages of the infection had changes in serum levels obscured by compensatory kidney function hence renal abnormalities on admission may indicate higher risks of deterioration ensuring appropriate triaging
table 9
summarises the studies used in analysing renal markers and covid-19covid-19 is a rapidly spreading pandemic increasing the burden on medical facilities symptoms vary from mild fever to ards complicating diagnosis prognosis and monitoring hence it is vital to ascertain a patients condition in a timely manner biomarkers are quantitative measurements used clinically for many conditions reflecting pathological development a summary of the biomarkers discussed in this review can be found in table 10
when assessing a patient with covid-19 infection biomarkers can be useful to clinicians in starting treatment and close monitoring though biomarkers may help improve prognosis and outcomes their significant variability between patients could affect the findings of the studiescompared to other biomarkers there is hesitancy in using wcc alone as it is influenced by many factors such as glucocorticoid treatment which increases it although wcc encompasses many cell types ncs and lcs are most clinically relevant biomarkers multiple studies on covid-19 have concurred high nlr in severe cases compared to non-severe cases due to high nc and low lc the use of lc independently has been suggested as a potential biomarker of covid-19 as patients have consistently low lc with significant lymphopenia reported in critically ill patients 18 therefore further research on wcc accuracy for assessing disease progression is necessaryalthough most of the studies referenced in this review are single centred studies originating in wuhan china the virus is now a global pandemic thus requiring international studies as a copious amount of data was collected from the same location it is possible patients may have been used in more than one study furthermore categorising patients into severe and non-severe sub-groups is dependent on the definitions of severity of covid-19 two very different measures of severity used in some studies are icu admission and onset of ards this questions the heterogeneity across the studies and validity of the findingsvariability can be accounted to the differences in patient exposure to the virus or intraindividual variability where differences in laboratory procedures lead to errors consequently the sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers are useful indicators to the effectiveness though not all studies discussed this to ascertain the usefulness of the biomarkers listed in this review as indicators of disease progression and whether they definitively rise in covid-19 requires further data collection statistical analysis using receiver-operator characteristic curves can also provide analysis sensitivity and false-positive ratesfindings of these studies have discovered changes in biomarker levels and may potentially be useful in creating a therapeutic intervention for instance one study has reviewed the use of anticoagulation therapy in patients with coagulopathy or marked rise in d-dimers in the setting of covid-19 38 low molecular weight heparin was found to be associated with better prognosis in severe cases to further asses the role of anti-coagulants as a treatment we encourage large interventional trails to study thismany studies in this review were limited due to small sample size and selection bias if conducted at one centre to improve reliability and reproducibility more research into the prognostic value of biomarkers is necessaryin conclusion the work to date suggests that there is clear evidence of how the levels of biomarkers may change according to severity of covid-19 infection this can be used as an adjunct in clinical practice to guide treatment and admission to icu by doing so it may improve prognosis and minimise the mortality rates however being in the infant stages of understanding the pathology of this infectious disease we urge for further research worldwide to better understand the changes noted in this reviewno funding obtained

cases particularly of persons with milder symptoms asymptomatic cases and in countries with low testing volume as of april 4 2020 over 1m cases have been confirmed with approximately 60000 deaths from the disease globally and major outbreaks in the us italy china and spain4 symptoms of covid-19 are non-specific and infected individuals may develop fever cough fatigue shortness of breath or muscle aches with further disease development leading to severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards myocardial injury sepsis septic shock and death5 6 the median incubation period is approximately five days and 975 of those who develop symptoms will do so within 115 days7 a larger analysis of 2449 patients reported hospitalization rates of 20 to 31 percent and icu admission rates of 49 to 115 percent8 this large number of patients requiring intensive care threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems around the world there is a need for a covid-19 disease severity test to prioritize care for patients at elevated risk of mortality and manage low risk patients in outpatient settings or at home through self-quarantinebiomarker tests provide key information about the health or disease status of an individual including covid-19 in an analysis of 127 hospitalized covid-19 patients in wuhan china the most common complications leading to death were acute cardiac injury 583 ards 556 coagulation dysfunction 389 and acute kidney injury 3339 biomarkers such as cardiac troponin i ctni c-reactive protein crp d-dimer and procalcitonin pct were significantly increased in those that died versus those that recovered with prognostic values as determined by area under the curve auc of 0939 0870 0866 and 0900 respectively in another study data from 82 covid-19 deaths found that respiratory cardiac hemorrhage hepatic and renal damage were present in 100 89 805 780 and 317 of patients respectively in which most patients had increased crp 100 and d-dimer 97110 the importance of d-dimer as a prognostic factor was also demonstrated with odds of death significantly increased for levels greater than 1gml on admission11 a biomarker of cardiac failure n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide nt-probnp has also been shown to be predictive of death in patients with community acquired pneumonia12 a recent study of 416 hospitalized patients with covid-19 reported 82 patients 197 had cardiac injury13 in which patients with myocardial damage had significantly higher levels of crp pct creatine kinase-myocardial band ck-mb ctni and nt-probnp patients with cardiac injury also more frequently required noninvasive mechanical ventilation 463 vs 39 or invasive mechanical ventilation 220 vs 42 and experienced higher rates of complications such as ards 585 vs 147 compared to patients without cardiac injury ultimately patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without it 512 vs 45 given such data others have recommended elevating treatment priority and aggressiveness for patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and evidence of cardiac injury14 this growing body of clinical evidence related to covid-19 disease severity suggests that biomarkers can play a dominant role in a scoring system to identify covid-19 patients with increased risk of severe disease and mortalitywhile there are multiple commercially available platforms for covid-19 diagnosis based on molecular detection of the viral rna there remains a significant gap in determining disease prognosis with respect to early identification of individuals that are at elevated risk of mortality identifying and monitoring those at risk of severe complications is critical for both resource planning and prognostication likewise ruling out andor reducing the admission of patients with very low risk of complications who can be safely managed through self-quarantine would conserve precious medical resources during a surge of new cases in an outbreak while clinical decision support tools have been developed for sepsis disease severity15 and are in development for covid-19 disease severity16 to our knowledge there are no scoring systems for covid-19 disease severity that are intricately linked to the biomarker tests at the point of care or based on lab-on-a-chip platforms access to an integrated test and scoring system for use at the point of care and in low- and middle-income countries would help to manage this disease on a global basisin this study we describe our most recent work toward developing the programmable bio nano chip p-bnc with the capacity to learn17 and adapting it to the task of assessing covid-19 disease severity this multiplex and multiclass platform has been demonstrated previously for the detection and quantitation of protein biomarkers small molecules and cellular markers in applications such as oral cancer ovarian cancer prostate cancer drugs of abuse cardiac heart disease and trauma1821 previously we developed the cardiac scorecard system for predicting a spectrum of cardiovascular disease22 this scoring system combines multiple risk factors and biomarker measurements to provide personalized reports for a range of disease indications with diagnostic and prognostic models for cardiac wellness acute myocardial infarction and heart failure the new study described here leverages our past experiences developing clinical decision support tools to efficiently adapt our flexible platform for the development of a prognostic test for covid-19this paper describes the customization of a point-of-care diagnostic tool that is suitable for the measurement of biomarkers that can be used to discriminate between covid-19 patients that recover vs those that die from complications of this terrible disease the work details both the development of a multiparameter protein assay and the diagnostic models that can lend information related to the covid-19 severity the model was trained and internally validated using data from 160 hospitalized covid-19 patients from wuhan china14 and was evaluated on an external case study of 12 hospitalized patients with a spectrum of covid-19 disease complications from shenzhen china to our knowledge this effort is the first quantitative point-of-care diagnostic panel linked to a clinical decision support tool that could be used to predict disease severity for patients suffering from covid-19 infections in addition to the new point-of-care diagnostic panel and decision tools an app is envisioned for immediate release to help clinicians in the next few weeks manage their covid-19 patientsthe design and fabrication of single-use disposable p-bnc cartridges equipped with a dedicated biohazardous waste reservoir used in this study were

eugene oregon for target detection using manufacturer specified protocolscartridges were manually populated with bead sensors and conjugate pad reagents bead sensors were strategically configured into designated locations within a 45 bead support chip for spatial identification detection antibodies were spotted onto a 215mm glass fiber conjugate pad emd millipore billerica ma which was inserted into the cartridge all assays were performed in direct sandwich-type immunoassay format at room temperature for each assay the sample was wetted over the sensor array for 15 seconds the sample was then delivered for 10 minutes at 10lmin followed by a 15 second wash at 200lmin the detecting antibody was eluted from the reagent pad for 1 minute at 100lmin by flowing pbs through the pad originating from the blister this was followed by a 5-minute final wash using a ramping flow rate the total time of the assay was approximately 16 minutes consuming a total volume of 1400limages were analyzed using a custom image analysis tool developed with matlab as described previously23 the fluorescence response of each bead was expressed as the average pixel intensity for a region of interest limited to the outer 10 of the bead diameter where the specific signal is concentrated bead sensors that were optically obstructed by debris or bubbles were excluded from analysis likewise failed assay runs due to leaks were rejected and re-assayed curve fitting routines were processed in matlab r2017bbeads were arranged column-by-column in the 45 chip two mouse-antibody sensitized beads were configured in the upper positions of the far-left column to serve as positive controls which respond to dye conjugated mouse-based antibodies used to visualize the target two crp-sensitized beads were positioned in the lower positions of the far-left column to serve as negative controls both positive and negative controls represent internal qaqc beads where the response parameters can be used as the basis for run rejection in the event of an error sensor beads ctni ck-mb myo and nt-probnp were arranged in a 4-fold redundancy in the remaining columns once the beads were in place the silicone coated release liner was removed from the chip and an optical cover was bonded to the exposed underlying adhesive sealing the analysis chambera cocktail of ctni ck-mb myo and nt-probnp standards were prepared in goat serum meridian life sciences at concentrations of 500 100 20 4 08 016 and 0032 ngml standards solutions were processed on the p-bnc assay system in triplicate and their responses were determined five matrix blank samples were also processed to determine the variation of the blank response the upper end of the assay range was determined as the highest concentration achievable without saturating the sensor beadsthis study involves the development of a covid-19 severity score using similar methods as described previously22 biomarker data from 160 hospitalized covid-19 patients were derived from a recent study in wuhan china14 patients were assigned to two outcomes patients who were discharged n117 and patients that died n43 a lasso logistic regression model for covid-19 was trained using the following as predictors age sex ctni crp pct and myo the maximum biomarker values across all time points were extracted for each patient and log transformed then all data were standardized with zero mean and unit variance missing data were imputed using the multivariate imputation by chained equations mice algorithm in statistical software r25 ten imputations were generated using predictive mean matching and logistic regression imputation models for numeric and categorical data respectively the data were partitioned using stratified 5-fold cross-validation to preserve the relative proportions of outcomes in each fold model training and selection were performed on each of the 10 imputation datasets models were selected for the penalty parameter corresponding to one standard error above the minimum deviance for additional shrinkage model performance was documented in terms of auc and median interquartile range iqr covid-19 severity scores of patients that died versus those that recovered using pooled estimates covid-19 severity scores from 5-fold cross-validation and pooled imputed data sets informed boxplots and scatterplots biomarker values and covid-19 scores were compared for discharged patients vs those that died using wilcoxon rank sum test age was compared using an independent t-test proportions were compared using the chi-squared test26 27 two-sided tests were considered statistically significant at the 005 levelwe externally validated the covid-19 severity score on data from a case study of 12 hospitalized covid-19 patients from shenzhen china28 results were presented in a scatterbox plot of covid-19 severity scores on three groups of patients defined as follows moderate patients whose only complication was pneumonia severe patients with both pneumonia and ards and critical patients with one or more of severe ards respiratory failure cardiac failure or shockthe biomarker profiles for covid-19 patients change over the timeline of infection therefore there is a need for a series of diagnostic tests that collectively covermonitor the entire timeline of infection here three tests are relevant the first is a molecular diagnostic that tests for the virus itself or part of the same these tests include rt-pcr or immunological tests that are specific for a component of the virus such as the coronavirus spike glycoprotein29 both assay modalities lend information on the amount of virus present during the initial stages of infection ie days 2 to 20 but lack accurate quantitation information as the samples are often collected from a nasal swab where the sample volume is ill-defined after this initial infection phase the virus itself becomes suppressed due to the activation of the humoral response of the host that involves production of anti-virus specific antibodiesthe second relevant diagnostic test involves detecting this antibody response as an indicator of exposure and subsequent immune response to the virus the humoral immune response usually begins with the production of igm antibodies igm antibodies tend to have low affinity since they are produced before b cells undergo somatic hypermutation however igm is pentameric in structure making it an effective activator of the complement system which is important in controlling infections of the bloodstream the monomeric igg dominates the later phases of the antibody response30 a test for coronavirus exposure and immune response uses viral antigen to detect these antibodies in the bloodstreamthroughout this timeline it would benefit care decisions and planning for resource allocation to identify those high-risk patients with underlying ongoing or past medical conditions the sooner these patients are identified the better is their prognosis through stabilizing measures and close monitoring as highlighted in the introduction one of the major diagnostic gaps and the focus of this paper is determining covid-19 disease severity which is the third relevant diagnostic test associated with covid-19 initial reports suggest that covid-19 is associated with severe disease that requires intensive care in approximately 5 of proven infections8 a report from the chinese center for disease control and prevention stated that the case fatality rate was higher for those with cardiovascular disease 105 diabetes 73 chronic respiratory disease 63 hypertension 60 and cancer 56 growing evidence suggests that covid-19 interacts with the cardiovascular system on multiple levels with increased morbidity and mortality in those with underlying cardiovascular conditions31 further evidence of myocardial injury has been observed at higher rates in those that died31 in a study of 187 patients 76 of patients 8 of 105 with normal cardiac troponin t levels and without cardiovascular disease died versus 694 of patients 25 of 36 with both elevated ctnt and cardiovascular disease14 the underlying health of the patient has a strong association with covid-19 outcomes and must be included in clinical decision support tools for determining disease severitywith this perspective in mind development of a portable assay system suitable for covid-19 disease severity would be extremely important in the coming weeks and months as the global pandemic moves forward given the broad spectrum of disease severity and rapid clinical decline of patients who develop pneumonia andor cardiac injury a point-of-care assay and decision support system could improve triage of patientsand eventually outcomesfor those who need more immediate and aggressive care incorporating the calculation of the covid-19 severity score into electronic health records ehr would provide health providers with actionable information at an early stage so resources can be focused on patients who are expected to be most severely affected the measurements of the proteins included in the score can either be provided by ehr integration of the point-of-care biosensor system described here or collected from multiple separate test platforms most widely used ehrs support the construction of custom-made decision support systems allowing a fast implementation of the covid-19 severity score based on currently available methods for measuring the proteins used for calculating the score the ehr integration of the point-of-care biosensor system can follow later once it is validated for this indication this stepwise approach will allow a fast deployment of the covid-19 severity score followed by an increased testing throughput through the implementation of the point-of-care biosensor system this will allow better triage of patients and allow scarce healthcare resources to be focused on the patients most at risk for developing severe symptomsthe p-bnc a point-of-care biosensor system with the capacity to learn is adapted here for the application of covid-19 disease severity figure 1 highlights the key diagnostic infrastructure required to complete the integrated biomarker assays as needed to establish the covid-19 severity score from a small amount of patient sample 100 l serum the cartridge and instrument perform a multistep assay sequence to digitize biology by converting fluorescence immunoassay signal into biomarker concentrations statistical learning algorithms trained on data of biomarker studies predict a spectrum of disease the result is a single value score which can be displayed to patients and providers in a mobile health app or directly on the instrumentation completing the test previously we published a general framework for implementing a point-of-care based clinical decision support system17 22 here we have adapted these methods to the task of predicting mortality in patients with covid-19 it should be emphasized that while the integrated testing and covid-19 severity score reporting here articulated represent what is arguably the most efficient delivery mode the scaling and regulatory approval for this test ecosystem will take several months to complete with the imminent arrival of the peak of the covid-19 pandemic it is important to emphasize that the covid-19 severity score can be generated immediately using biomarker measurements collected from multiple separate test platforms we anticipate this contribution could have an immediate impact on covid-19 patient management and we plan to promptly distribute the covid-19 severity score capabilities following additional model refinement and validationselection of the biomarkers targeted for the development of this covid-19 severity score was based on the following processcriteria and summarized in table 1 biomarkers were identified as relevant to complications associated with covid-19 including those associated with acute inflammationinfection crp and various stages of the cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease crp pct acute myocardial infarction ctni myoglobin and congestive heart failure nt-pro bnp d-dimer the biomarker pct an aid in decision making on antibiotic therapy for hospitalized patients or in patients with suspected or confirmed lower respiratory tract infections including community-acquired pneumonia acute bronchitis and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was also selected as a valuable tool in the covid-19 pandemic to identify patients at risk for bacterial coinfection and adverse outcomes importantly all the selected biomarkers have reportedly been shown to exhibit significant differences in their levels in covid-19 patients that recover vs those that diealthough the p-bnc is designed to accommodate both soluble and cellular targets using either bead or membrane-based assay configurations respectively we opted to solely focus on soluble protein biomarkers further we restricted biomarker choices to those that have complementary concentration ranges and those that are stable allowing for their simultaneous measurement though lymphocytes and cytokines have been associated with covid-19 mortality neither of these two classes of analytes were selected because of their incompatibility with these selection criteriathe complementary covid-19 assay panels for disease severity index described here and surveillance panel to be featured in future publications are shown along with their relevant immunoschematics in figure 2 briefly bead-based tests for the severity index panel targets the simultaneous measurement of six designated proteins all compatible for multiplexed detection in this direct sandwich immunoassay involving six matched pairs of capturedetection antibodies all six biomarkers are first captured by their corresponding beads and then specifically detected via their matched alexa fluor 488-conjugated detection antibodies presented to the bead array during the development of these fully quantitative assays control experiments are conducted to ensure that there is no crosstalk interference between each of the assaysa multiplex immunoassay was developed for a subset of the proposed biomarkers to demonstrate proof of concept for the covid-19 disease severity panel the p-bnc platform can perform powerful and quantitative multiplexed measurements over an extended range calibration curves are necessary to quantitate the concentration of molecular targets in solution which are critical inputs to the diagnostic algorithm figure 3 demonstrates this capability with four simultaneously generated calibration curves for ctni ck-mb myo and nt-probnp that cover a concentration range from 0032 to 500 ngml error bars indicate bead-to-bead precision with four redundant beads measured per sensor class as shown the response data for each biomarker exhibits an excellent fit to a five-parameter logistic regression as part of the multiplexed assay development effort specificity was confirmed for the four-plex panel as shown in inset images on figure 3 here a single antigen standard at high concentration 1000ngml was processed against a cartridge configured for multiplexed detection as expected monoclonal antibodies are highly specific for their target antigen where high doses of each single antigen generated minimal cross-reactivity on non-target sensors although this work represents a subset of the full covid-19 panel the cartridge facilitates multiplexing of up to 20 different biomarkers and can be easily expanded to accommodate the panel and test validity controls we anticipate that one or more of the selected six biomarkers may be dropped as additional covid-19 clinical data are used to optimize the final covid-19 severity score due to redundancy of patient discrimination information afforded by these biomarkershaving identified a method to measure strategic biomarkers in a multiplexed panel this next step involves the translation of these test values alongside key clinical metrics into information relevant to covid-19 disease severity a covid-19 disease severity model was developed based on data from 160 hospitalized patients from wuhan china14 here 160 patients with hypertension were admitted to the hospital for covid-19 in which 117 were eventually discharged and 43 died table 3 summarizes the patient characteristics and lab values for both patient groups interestingly males accounted for 70 of the deaths vs 44 of the discharged patients this study finds significantly higher levels of biomarkers ctni ck-mb myo crp and pct in patients that died vs those that were discharged likewise age was a statistically significant factor with mean sd of 63 13 and 73 8 in the discharged and died groups respectivelya covid-19 severity score was trained and internally validated based on a subset of the targeted biomarkers ctni pct myo and crp age and sex the disease discrimination potential is displayed in figure 4 for this analysis covid-19 severity scores are shown for two patient groups those patients that recovered vs those that passed away from the complications the covid-19 severity score is the lasso logistic regression response from internal validation interpreted as the probability of death individual points on the scatterplot represent the covid-19 severity score for one sample with overlaid boxplots representing the covid-19 severity score for the population of patients additional model information is included in the supplemental materials including model coefficients figure s1 and auc values table s1 the median iqr covid-19 severity scores were significantly higher for those that died vs those that were discharged 59 4083 vs 9 617 respectively patients who underwent any invasive or noninvasive ventilation were at an intermediate risk of death with median iqr scores of 17 1039 figure s2 the auc 95 ci of the multivariate covid-19 severity score was 094 089099 demonstrating proof of concept for the clinical decision support toolone limitation of this study was that all patients in the training dataset had hypertension and are thus at an elevated risk for cardiovascular events since the test panel contains several cardiac biomarkers its possible that these training data could lead to overoptimistic results however in addition to cardiac biomarkers the expanded biomarker panel represents diverse pathophysiology ie indicators of infection inflammation mortality thrombotic events and rhabdomyolysis which have the potential to significantly improve generalizability plans to evaluate and optimize the covid-19 severity score model on external data are in place despite this limitation the preliminary results demonstrate strong promise for the covid-19 severity score reporting these preliminary findings now is critically important given the stage of the pandemicpreviously we have used the p-bnc platform to develop various wellness and disease severity scores for oral cancer18 19 32 and cardiac heart disease22 shown in figure 5 is the initial rough scale for the covid-19 severity score which was based on the cdcs interim clinical guidance for management of patients with confirmed covid-1933 the continuous scale covid-19 severity score has the potential to assist the identification of patients with severecritical disease status for example most patients 80 with a low covid-19 severity score may be considered at mildmoderate risk for developing complications up to mild pneumonia and can be managed at home or in outpatient settings about 15 of patients may have an elevated covid-19 severity score and would be at risk for severe disease with complications such as pneumonia ards sepsis cardiomyopathy and others approximately 5 of patients may have a high covid-19 severity score that would be considered critical requiring hospitalization intensive care and mechanical ventilation with complications such as respiratory failure shock multiorgan failure and deathfinally we evaluated the covid-19 severity score on data from a case study of 12 hospitalized covid-19 patients28
figure 6 presents a scatterbox plot of covid-19 severity scores on three groups of patients covid-19 severity scores were found to increase with disease severity moderate patients whose only complication was pneumonia severe patients with both pneumonia and ards and critical patients with one or more of severe ards respiratory failure cardiac failure or shock groups had median iqr covid-19 severity scores of 9 417 28 2436 and 36 2883 respectively although this analysis evaluates a small sample of patients these preliminary results show potential for the covid-19 severity score to be calibrated to a disease severity scale in addition to cross-sectional and population-based comparisons this covid-19 severity score could also be used for longitudinal monitoring of patients in this manner an individuals time series measurements could be used to track changes in biomarker-based covid-19 severity score over time preliminary findings figure s3 demonstrate that the average trajectories decrease for the discharged group increase for the died group suggesting that the covid-19 severity score could provide valuable lead time in discharging patients with low risk earlier while prioritizing care for those at elevated risk of mortality future efforts will be used to define various decision cuts points reference ranges and change scores to help guide clinical decision making including therapy decisions future efforts may also adapt this clinical decision support tool for ards resulting from other infectious viral agents such as influenza and varicella-zoster bacteria such as mycoplasma chlamydia and legionella and parasites such as the malaria causing plasmodium falciparum34this study establishes the framework for a point-of-care covid-19 severity score and clinical decision support system our studies find that the median covid-19 severity score was significantly lower for the group that recovered versus the group that died from covid-19 complications 605 versus 966 respectively the auc value for the covid-19 severity score was 094 demonstrating strong potential for its utility in identifying patients with increased risk of mortality plans are now in place to confirm the final selection of biomarkers for an integrated point-of-care covid-19 severity score disease severity test it is possible that some of the biomarkers may yield redundant information as such these redundant biomarkers may be eliminated to create a sparser diagnostic panel with improved generalizabilitythese lab-on-a-chip diagnostic capabilities have the potential to yield the first quantitative point-of-care diagnostic panel linked to a clinical decision support tool for predicting mortality from covid-19 an experienced team and established translation partnerships are both in place to move these systems into real-world practice in a timely manner further the release of an app for immediate impact on covid-19 patient management in the next few weeks is anticipated future work may also involve developing a test on the same platform for population-based covid-19 community surveillance in clinical settings ambulances hospitals clinics laboratories and for public settings that are at risk for community spread businesses schools airports train stations the development and distribution of a portable affordable widely distributed smart sensor technology with anticipated availabilityreadiness within months promises to be an important solution for the management of the current coronavirus crisis as well as an adaptable tool to combat future threats of a new virus or biological threat likewise in addition to this covid-19 severity score a sustaining contribution of this work may be in the development of an ards clinical decision support tool for other infectious viral agents bacteria and parasitessaliva is a hypotonic fluid in nature the major salivary glands such as the parotid glands submandibular glands and sublingual glands secrete approximately 90 of saliva the salivary glands have high permeability and are surrounded by abundant capillaries blood and acini which can exchange molecules hence biomarkers in the blood circulation can infiltrate acini and ultimately secreted into the saliva 1 every day 600 ml of serous and mucinous saliva is secreted from the human salivary glands which contains minerals electrolytes buffers enzymes and enzyme inhibitors growth factors and cytokines immunoglobulins eg secretory immunoglobulin a iga mucins and other glycoproteins 2 saliva has been studied thoroughly as a potential diagnostic tool and it is expected to become a substitute for other biological fluids such as serum or urine in disease diagnosisadvantages of salivary testing for diagnosis are as follows 3-6non-invasive economical

saliva does not clot and can be manipulated more easily than bloodemerging latest technologies have disclosed large numbers of medically important salivary biomarkers for various disease conditions including cancer autoimmune viral bacterial cardiovascular and metabolic diseases 7 covid-19 is associated with human to human transmission and was recently detected in the saliva of infected patients saliva can have a significant role in the human-to-human transmission salivary diagnostics may provide an easy and cost-effective point-of-care platform for quick and early diagnosis of covid-19 8human diseases such as cancer cardiovascular metabolic infectious and neurological diseases have global impact diagnosis of these conditions is very demanding and needs supplementing clinical analysis with laboratory testing 4 saliva is a complex fluid comprising of proteins enzymes hormones antibodies cytokines and antimicrobial constituents 7 the process of entry of these constituents from the blood into the saliva is by transcellular passive intracellular diffusion and active transport or paracellular routes by extracellular ultrafiltration within the salivary glands or through the gingival crevice 910 saliva is colourless odourless and has a relative density of 1004-1009 and a ph of 66-71 salivary fluid is an exocrine secretion comprising of approximately 99 water containing a variety of electrolytes and proteins represented by enzymes immunoglobulins and other antimicrobial factors which are of importance to oral health saliva protects the teeth and the oroesophageal mucosa through a number of mechanisms besides maintaining the integrity of these tissues saliva also has multiple functions in relation to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract this action occurs due to the presence of the digestive enzyme -amylase ptyalin which divides the starch into maltose maltotriose and dextrins lubrication of oral surfaces tooth mineralization buffering and antimicrobial activity are other beneficial effects of saliva it is believed that changes in saliva are indicative of wellness of our healthsaliva in the diagnosis of diseasesin view of the rapid development made in salivary studies the concept of salivaomics was proposed salivaomics involves genomics transcriptomics proteomics metabonomics and microrna mirna analysis wong was responsible for setting up a professional salivaomics knowledge base skb that can systematically manage the data of research related to salivaomics 11 the limitations concerning the usage of saliva for diagnosis due to its low concentration of analytes compared to blood have been overcome with the development of precise molecular methods and nanotechnology 12cariesthe prevalence of dental caries is directly proportional to the microbial load of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus in the saliva samaranayake used paraffin wax to stimulate the production of the salivary samples which were incubated in a selective growth media for up to 24 hours 13 saliva from populations with high caries activity contained 1  106 ml-1 of s mutans andor 1  105 ml-1 of lactobacillus whereas populations with low caries activity harboured 1  105 ml-1 of s mutans andor 1  104 ml-1 of lactobacillusthe presence of both the pathogens in high titres using a commercially available test crt bacteria ivoclar-vivadent inc amherst ma usa has shown a positive correlation with the presence of caries in children and adults 14 the prognostication of caries susceptibility was assessed with an experimental assay using biomarkers genetically determined oligosaccharides profiles present on salivary glycoproteins saliva also protects against caries since it contains antibacterial agents can mechanically clear the pathogens and has a buffering capacity to decrease the acid concentration on tooth surfaces hence alterations in quantity and composition of saliva can also provide potential tools to detect and monitor cariesperiodontal diseasesperiodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory process of the periodontium in response to bacterial plaque deposited on the teeth bacterial infections forming biofilms induce gingivitis destroy the alveolar bone and periodontal ligament cause apical migration of the epithelial attachment resulting in the formation of periodontal pockets and induce irreversible loss and exfoliation of the teeth porphyromonas gingivalis is a red complex bacteria that is closely associated with periodontitis p gingivalis saliva kit which is based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay have been developed by researchers to specifically detect this bacterium in saliva the kit can detect both laboratory and clinical isolate strains of p gingivalis at concentrations of 5  104 to 5  105 cfuml-1 and yields results quickly within 90 seconds when compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction the p gingivalis kit is faster in detection and has a sensitivity and a specificity of 92 and 96 respectively 15 isolation of bacterial species from oral specimens using classical in vitro methods is only possible for cultivable species such as porphyromonas gingivalis treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia present as a complex biofilm in destructive periodontitisseveral salivary biomarkers have been studied for the diagnosis and prognostication of periodontal diseases these include inflammatory mediators enzymes epithelial keratins immunoglobulins salivary ions and hormones gingival crevicular fluid gcf has been used to detect these potential biomarkers specifically the presence of matrix metalloproteinase-8 mmp-8 an enzyme responsible for tissue destruction in gcf has been positively linked with periodontal disease progression 16 in 2010 an immunochromatographic chair-side dip-stick test became commercially available to determine the presence or absence of mmp-8 in the gcf 17 it has been reported that there is a positive association between salivary soluble toll-like receptor-2 and interleukin-4 and periodontal disease 18 levels of aspartate aminotransferase ast and alkaline phosphatase alp are elevated in periodontal diseases salivary ast can be used as a marker for monitoring periodontal diseaseaccording to researchers variation in more than 70 genes can be attributed to periodontal diseases 19 hence salivary genomics represent another fascinating platform for the diagnosis of periodontitis after analysing dna obtained from patients saliva it was recently validated that genetic mutations of the il-6 gene cytokine involved in periodontal tissue destruction are a significant risk factor for chronic periodontitis in caucasians 20 additional research to isolate genetic microbial and host-derived risk factors will elucidate more on potential biomarkers for periodontal diseasesoral cancer and systemic malignanciesalmost in all types of cancer the prerequisite to good prognosis is the early diagnosis salivary constituents such as proteins mrna and dna have been used in the diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma oscc somatic mutations of tumour-specific dna are responsible for the onset and development of malignancy which can be detected in the saliva or other body fluids and can also be used as biomarkers to diagnose oral or other tumours in saliva tumour-specific dna was positive in 100 of patients with oral tumours whereas only 47-70 of patients with other tumours carry tumour-specific dna in the saliva in contrast tumour-specific dna was found in 80 of plasma samples from patients with oral tumours and in 86-100 of patients with tumours in other sites which validates the use of saliva as a potential tool to diagnose oral cancers 21oscc is the most common form of cancer affecting oral cavity researchers have found that salivary levels of specific proteins such as cd44 a cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell-to-cell interaction cyfra 21-1 a fragment of cytokeratin 19 tissue polypeptide antigen tps and cancer antigen 125 ca-125 are increased in patients with oscc and have been suggested as oral cancer biomarkers 22 the use of 7 oscc-associated saliva rnas transcriptomes has shown a prediction accuracy rate of 81 indicating their potential for oral carcinoma detection 23mutations of the tumour suppressor p53 were first described for salivary gland adenomas in 1992 and later in a pilot study of saliva from breast cancer subjects 24 few studies suggest elevated levels of the cancer antigen ca15-3 and the oncogene c-erb2 in woman with breast cancer as compared to controls chen et al identified the tumour marker c125 in saliva of subjects with malignant ovarian tumours 25lung cancermutations identified in the egf receptor egfr are the tumour-specific biomarkers for non-small cell lung carcinoma nsclc a unique core technology known as electric field-induced release and measurement depends on a multiplexible electrochemical sensor that can detect egfr mutations in bodily fluids was shown to be effective for the detection of egfr mutations in the saliva of patients with nsclc 26 this implies that proteomic biomarkers could be the key for the early diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancerprostate cancerprostate specific antigen psa is a useful marker for detecting prostate adenocarcinoma pa monitoring the treatment or assessing its recurrence salivary psa levels correlate with serum psa levels in patients with prostate adenocarcinoma mir-21 and mir-141 are two tumour biomarkers whose levels are significantly elevated in patients with early-stage and advanced-stage prostate cancer respectively the expression of both these tumour markers in the saliva can be detected by nano-graphene oxide which makes it a non-invasive approach to diagnose early-stage prostate cancer 27autoimmune disorderssjogrens syndrome ss is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by reduced secretion of the salivary glands and lacrimal glands and associated endocrine disturbance salivary secretion from individuals affected with sjogrens syndrome demonstrates elevated levels of antibodies and cytokines such as iga igg prostaglandin-e2 and interleukin-6 along with reduction in oral phosphate levels and xerostomia due to reduced salivary flow which may result in causing infections caries difficulty in swallowing and oral pain 28 salivary protein analysis indicates an increased level of lactoferrin beta-2 microglobulin lysozyme c and cystatin c and decreased levels of salivary amylase and carbonic anhydrase 29cystic fibrosis cf is an inherited disorder which is caused due to a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr gene the cftr protein is expressed in the epithelial cells of the parotid gland inflicting its involvement cf is most frequently seen in caucasians usually results in early death from respiratory complications saliva of cf patients has elevated levels of calcium and phosphate which may explain higher incidence of calculus observed in such individuals these patients also possess higher salivary levels of cathepsin-d chloride potassium and sodium ions with a lower salivary volume and ph compared to healthy individuals in addition saliva samples in younger cf patients have been found to have higher levels of proteins antioxidants and uric acid compared to their normal counterparts 29diabetesdiabetes is a metabolic disease caused by lack of insulin secretion insulin action or insulin resistance which impairs the bodys ability to process blood glucose a positive association found between -2-macroglobulin and hba1c demonstrated that levels of -2-macroglobulin in the saliva could reflect the glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 30 type 1 diabetic hyperglycemia requires measuring exhaled methyl nitrate 31 investigations indicated an association between blood glucose levels and exhaled methyl nitrate presumptively because of interaction of superoxide dismutase with nitric oxide as a byproduct of elevated oxidative reactions use of gingival crevicular blood as a measure of blood glucose was proposed by strauss et al in a study of 54 subjects blood collected from gcf was compared to blood obtained with a finger-stick results showed good correlation between samples collected from the two sites 32cardiovascular diseasecardiovascular disease cvd is the group of disorders of heart and blood vessels and includes diseases such as atherosclerosis myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease the research done by kosaka et al revealed significantly elevated levels of salivary inflammatory cytokines including il-1 il-6 tnf- and prostaglandin e2 in both atherosclerosis and periodontal diseases these cytokines can be potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of periodontal disease and atherosclerosis 33 salivary markers of cardiovascular diseases include c-reactive protein crp myoglobin myo creatinine kinase myocardial band ckmb cardiac troponins ctn and myeloperoxidase when used in combination with an ecg shows a positive association with myocardial infarct patients as compared to healthy controls 29crp protein is an inflammatory mediator that is released in response to acute injury or infection it can lead to atherogenesis significantly salivary crp levels were found to correlate with plasma crp levels obtained from blood samples of a population at risk for cardiovascular complications 34 cardiac troponin ctn a biomarker for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction can be detected in saliva which is released in response to cardiac cell necrosis 35 salivary ctn levels were shown to be a sensitive diagnostic tool in patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction 36 more clinical studies are needed to validate salivary biomarkers for cardiovascular diseasesviral infectionsdiagnosis of viral infections presently depends on salivary biomarkers such as viral dna and rna antigens and antibodies there are saliva-based antibody tests to detect several viruses the raffaele scientific institute in milan used a salivary test named oraquick hepatitis c virus rapid antibody test to detect the hepatitis c virus 37 the dengue virus denv rna and non-structural protein 1 antigens are detectable from saliva which might provide an effective way to diagnose dengue salivary levels of anti-dengue igm and igg revealed sensitivity of 92 and specificity of 100 in the diagnosis of infection nefzi et al found that saliva seems to be more sensitive than the blood in the detection of hhv-6 or human cytomegalovirus 38 salivary tests using polymerase chain reaction for the detection of human papilloma virus have been establishedcovid-19coronavirus disease covid-19 is a kind of viral pneumonia with its epicentre in wuhan china it is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the unfolding of sars-cov-2 has been recognised as the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in the twenty-first century 39 similar to sars-cov covid-19 can be efficiently transmitted between humans via droplets and fomites during close unprotected contact between infector and infecteecoronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive sense single-stranded rna genome 26-32 kb 40 four coronavirus genera     have been identified so far with human coronaviruses hcovs detected in the  coronavirus hcov-229e and nl63 and  coronavirus mers-cov sars-cov hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 genera 41 coronavirus s protein has been reported as a significant determinant of virus entry into host cells the envelope spike glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptor ace2 for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 cd209l a c-type lectin also called l-sign for sars-cov dpp4 for mers-covvirus genome sequencing of patients with pneumonia hospitalized in the month of december 2019 disclosed the presence of a formerly unknown -cov strain in all of them 42 this isolated novel -cov shows 88 identity to the sequence of two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndromes sars-like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 and about 50 identity to the sequence of mers-cov 42 the novel -cov was named sars-cov-2 by the international virus classification commissionpatients with covid-19 show clinical symptoms including fever nonproductive cough dyspnea myalgia fatigue normal or decreased leukocyte counts and radiographic evidence of pneumonia one of the important mechanisms for ards is the cytokine storm the deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response ensuing from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn-a ifn-g il-1b il-6 il-12 il-18 il-33 tnf-a tgf-b etc and chemokines ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 cxcl8 cxcl9 cxcl10 etcrapid and accurate detection of covid-19 is crucial in controlling the outbreak within the community and in hospitals nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the suggested upper respiratory tract specimen types for covid-19 diagnosis the collection of these specimen types requires close contact between healthcare workers and patients which jeopardize a risk of transmission of the virus to the healthcare workers furthermore the collection of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens causes discomfort and may cause bleeding especially in patients with condition such as thrombocytopenia 43some virus strains have been detected in saliva as long as 29 days after infection indicating that a non-invasive platform to rapidly differentiate the biomarkers using saliva may enhance disease detection 44 the sputum of a lower respiratory tract was produced by only 28 of covid-19 patients which indicates a strong limitation as specimen for diagnostic evaluation 45 it has been previously demonstrated that saliva has a high consistency rate of greater than 90 with nasopharyngeal specimens in the detection of respiratory viruses including coronaviruses 46in hong kong covid-19 testing was performed by public health laboratory services branch for patients who fulfilled the enhanced surveillance criteria 47 a patient is considered to have confirmed infection if covid-19 was detected in their nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens saliva was collected and subjected to nucleic acid extraction and real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction for covid-19 rt-qpcr is the gold standard for detecting pathogenic viruses in respiratory secretions and blood a total of 12 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection in hong kong were included saliva specimens were collected at a median of two days after hospitalization range 0-7 days covid-19 was detected in the initial saliva specimens of 11 patients 917 in 33 patients whose nasopharyngeal specimens tested negative for covid-19 all the saliva specimens also tested negativerecently researchers from rucdr infinite biologics at rutgers university have successfully validated saliva as being a viable biosample source for covid-19 detection when compared to nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs according to them the utilisation of saliva to extract viral rna was in fact a robust source for covid-19 detection and equals in performance to the approved swab-based collection samples saliva testing will help with the global shortage of swabs for sampling and increase testing of patients and it will eliminate the requirement of health care professionals to collect samples 48the use of saliva will permit specimen collection outside the hospitals where airborne-infection isolation rooms are not available such as in outpatient clinics or in the community sars-cov has been shown to infect epithelial cells in salivary gland ducts in rhesus macaques the presence of covid-19 in patients saliva suggests the likelihood of salivary gland infection however it should be noted that saliva specimens not only contain saliva secreted from major or minor salivary glands but also contain secretions coming down from the nasopharynx or coming up from the lung via the action of cilia lining the airway more studies are needed to delineate the sources of covid-19 in salivain the setting where huge number of individuals require screening saliva would constitute a practical noninvasive specimen type since healthcare workers are not required to collect saliva specimens the use of saliva specimens will eliminate the waiting time and therefore the results would be available much sooner this is vital in busy clinical settings covid-19 may be transmitted via saliva directly or indirectly even among patients without coughing or other respiratory symptoms saliva specimens have high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of respiratory viruses by an automated multiplex clinical laboratory improvement amendments-waived point-of-care molecular assay when compared with those of nasopharyngeal aspirate the use of saliva also reduces the time and cost associated with the collection of specimen 47 further studies are needed to evaluate the potential diagnostic of covid-19 in saliva and its impact on transmission of this virus which is pivotal to develop rapid diagnostic tests and effective strategies for preventionsaliva offers many benefits as a diagnostic fluid as it is easy to collect store and contains extremely good quality dna thus saliva can be an ideal alternative for blood the research in the field of salivaomics has a key role in identifying biomarkers and exploring the role of saliva in diagnosis of diseases it is anticipated that the development of precise salivary diagnostic tools will make salivary diagnostics a reality in the future saliva can be provided by patients without any invasive procedures the use of saliva specimens will decrease the risk of nosocomial transmission of covid-19 and is ideal for situations in which oro- or nasopharyngeal specimen collection may be contraindicated it can also reduce or eliminate the need for health care professionals for collecting samples recent research suggests that saliva can be used as a viable biosample for the detection of covid-19 further studies are required to validate the same salivary diagnostics may play a pivotal role in detection of covid-19 and can offer mass screening of the populationup to mar 29 2020 there were 665361 82342 in china and 583019 outside of china confirmed cases of novel coronavirus covid-2019 infection reported worldwide causing 30864 deaths httpwwwnhcgovcn the target of covid-2019 angiotensin converting enzyme 2ace2 is expressed in the heart esophagus kidney bladder and ileum as well as the alveoli1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov has many similarities to covid-2019 and has been shown in an animal model to mediate myocardial inflammation and damage through down-regulation of myocardial ace2 direct effects of sars-cov on the myocardium may have been responsible for adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with sars2 and the myocardium may be directly affected by covid-20191 recently two case reports from china3 and italy4 have found that covid-2019 could cause fulminant myocarditis even without symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia but whether acute cardiac injury is common and whether it is associated with death is still unclear we thus undertook a systemic search of the literature for evidence of cardiac injury among individuals infected with covid-2019the systematic review is reported following the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology moose guidelines5 no language restrictions were imposed on the search we searched the electronic databases pubmed and embase from dec 12019 to mar 272020 using the keywords coronavirus pneumonia ncov hcov sars-cov-2 covid ncp alone and in combinations as well as medrxiv httpswwwmedrxivorg ssrn httpswwwssrncom and the reference lists of all studies identified eligible studies were those that reported cardiac specific biomarkers troponin creatine kinasemb fraction myoglobin or nt-probnp or acute cardiac injury any studies reporting cardiac specific biomarkers or acute cardiac injury according to severity of covid-19 or mortality according to cardiac injury were included studies of the same hospital with period within range of other studies or with data that could not be reliably extracted were excludedth and jl scrutinized the titles and abstracts of the 2961 reports identified and excluded clearly irrelevant studies two authors th and jl then did independent review of the full reports for the remaining 553 studies and extracted data independently from the 28 with relevant information efig 1 in supplementary material any disagreements were resolved by a third author yc when estimates were only presented graphically we used the software g3data version 151 wwwfrantzfisoftwareg3dataphp to extract estimatesfor analysis of cardiac injury biomarkers first standard mean differences smd were calculated for all biomarkers using mean sd values and group size and pooled using random effects models then separate meta-analysis was carried out with smd using for troponin troponin i and t or high sensitivity troponin i and t and weighted mean differences wmd for other biomarkers summary relative risks rrs with 95 cis were estimated for the association between acute cardiac injury and death the degree of heterogeneity was assessed using the i2-index an i2 statistic was considered to reflect low likelihood 025 moderate likelihood 2675 and high likelihood 76100 of differences beyond chance as was a p value from a q test of heterogeneity of less than or equal to 0056 if the results were homogeneous i2  50 and p  005 fixed effects models were utilized whereas if these results were heterogeneous i2  50 or p  005 then random effect models were used if only median and interquartile range q25 q75 were reported then we assumed the median was equal to the mean and that the standard deviation sd was q75-q252 we also conducted meta-regression to assess whether severity differences in cardiac injury biomarkers were modified by patient characteristics age sex smoking diabetes hypertension history of cardiovascular diseases coronary heart disease cerebrovascular diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases chronic kidney disease and severity definitions of covid-19 in this meta-regression analysis cardiac injury biomarkers are selected with priority troponinck-mb  myogloblinnt-probnp for each study for example if one study reported troponin and ck-mb we used troponin as the outcome and used the standard mean difference model to combine the results evidence of publication bias was examined using eggers regression test for funnel asymmetry in addition to visual inspection of the funnel plots combined means of hstroponin i and nt-probnp were calculated as the sum over studies of the mean value of the biomarker and n is the number of participants data were summarised using inverse variance weighted meta-analysis and a 2-sided p value of less than or equal to 005 was deemed significant statistical analysis was performed with stata

in this systematic review and meta-analysis we found that there is an increased risk of acute cardiac injury associated with more severe covid-2019 infection and this acute cardiac injury is associated with death patients with a history of hypertension seem to suffer more from cardiac damageour results are in line with a previous meta-analysis of covid-19 on cardiac troponin i which found troponin i significantly increased in covid-19 patients with severe disease compared to those with milder infection38 increases in troponin i ck-mb and nt-probnp are indicators of possible cardiac damage during covid infection and three published case reports have found fulminant myocarditis3

4 and cardiac tamponade39 after covid infection assessments of the dynamic change in hstni and nt-probnp show that cardiac injury biomarkers rise above normal by the midpoint of hospitalization and spike immediately before death which seems to be most seen in severe cases this pattern of elevation suggests that cardiac damage may already exist before multiple organ dysfunction syndromein a large report containing 44672 confirmed cases from china approximately 81 of covid-19 infections were mild cases which did not require hospitalization with case-fatality rates of 49 in critical cases and 0 in mild ones40 in our analysis more severe infection with covid-19 is associated with 14 times higher mortality risk compared to mild infection and acute cardiac injury mostly indicated by abnormal cardiac biomarker levels is associated with 4 times higher mortality risk in one of the included studies abnormal troponin i was associated with an 80 times higher risk of in-hospital death although the sample size was small20 it is possible that direct cardiac damage or cardiac shock partially explain deathbased on these results we are in support of previous suggestions that longitudinal measurement of cardiac damage biomarkers is needed during hospitalization stay for sars-cov-2 infection which may help to identify a subset of patients with cardiac injury and thereby predict the progression of covid-19 towards an unfavorable outcome38 moreover studies shall also be planned to determine whether or not cardiac supportive measures such as echocardiographic testing and heart failure treatments such as mechanical ventilation inotropic agents and vasopressors are beneficial in patients with significant elevation of cardiac injury biomarkersour meta-analysis has several potential limitations firstly there was obvious heterogeneity among studies regarding definitions of severity of covid-19 acute cardiac injury and biomarkers to detect cardiac injury although no significant publication bias were observed efig 6 secondly this meta-analysis was conducted for studies that failed to describe all relevant characteristics of individual patients and it was hard to adjust for potentially confounding factors such as age gender and use of treatments such as renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors finally all included studies were retrospective and there are risk of bias in the data collectedthe severity of covid-19 is associated with acute cardiac injury and the latter is associated with death patients with a history of hypertension seem to suffer more from this kind cardiac damage future studies are needed identify whether cardiac supportive measures and heart failure treatments are beneficial in severe patients infected with covid-19the following are the supplementary data related to this article

 however none of them approaches towards the development of non-invasive biosensor which can be user friendly and cheaperrapid and early diagnosis of any diseases is always a major concern for any country currently the situation related to covid-19 is enormous as we do not have any rapid system for early and fast detection of this virus several countries are trying to develop a rapid kit based on antibodies or gene for detection there are other techniques which can resolve out this problem with a more manageable approach and detect the virus rapidly one of these techniques is biomarker based on sensors terming biosensors there are several reported biosensor based on biomarkers which accurately detect particular diseases such as non-invasive biosensor develop by kumar et al for oral cancer detection which used cyfra-21 as a specific biomarker for oral cancer 6 same like these specific biomarkers for covid-19 can also be used and biosensor can be madefurthermore the other issue with this virus detection is human to human transmission while detecting professional working for the diagnosis are in a major threat to get into the contact of this virus and get affected and to subdue this approach this biomarkers based biosensor can be integrated with microfluidics system which will restrict the sample amount as well as the chance of virus transmission such as singh et al has tried to develop a microfluidics-based biosensor for influenza detection 7 in this review article we have listed out the significant biomarkers which were reported in various paper after the clinical studies in covid-19 patients in china biomarkers such as serum amyloid a saa which secreted in a more substantial amount in covid-19 patient as compared to a healthy patient serum ferritin is also a considerable biomarkers from these studies which also shows a potential to detect specifically covid-19 as there is difference between secretion range and cut off the range furthermore biosensor based on this approach will be non-invasive that can be user friendly in use so that the need of highly qualified professional limit can be overcome apart this others biomarkers which can also be considered are listed in table 2
with the secretion range in healthy patient and covid-19 infected patient 5 lastly there are some more studies which report some more biomarkers such as il-10 il-6 and il-1beta 4considering the urgent need for rapid detection of covid-19 the biomarkers based sensor can plays a pivotal role as it will reduce the time to detect will be cost-effective and also reduce the chance of virus transmission while diagnosis we can look forward to the integration of biosensor with microfluidics systemthrough clinical studies of covid-19 patient biomarkers such as serum ferritin interleukin-2r are found to shows considerable difference in their secretion range of healthy patients and affected patients with covid-19 diseases further to develop biomarkers based biosensor such biomarkers can be used and to investigate more specific biomarkers further proteomics analysis can be done we can also look forward with the integration of microfluidics system with this biosensor so that a minimal amount of sample is used and the chance of virus transmission remains insignificantthe schematic representation of this review is prepared in fig 1

urgent need for reliable biomarkers related to coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 disease progression in order to stratify high risk patients the rapid disease spread necessitates the immediate categorization of patients into risk groups following diagnosis to ensure optimal resource allocation novel biomarkers are needed to identify patients who will suffer rapid disease progression to severe complications and death the identification of novel biomarkers is strictly related to the understanding of viral pathogenetic mechanisms as well as cellular and organ damage effective biomarkers would be helpful for screening clinical management and prevention of serious complicationspreliminary studies describe vasculitic processes underlying organ damage in seriously ill patients induced by the activation of inflammatory cascades complement activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines ie interleukin il-6 12 vasculitic damage causes edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome

of cardiovascular damage in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 patients with ischemic heart disease and hypertension among the most frequent preexisting comorbidities associated with sars-cov-2 mortality 56 current clinical practice suggests determining il-6 d-dimer lactate dehydrogenase ldh and transaminases in addition to routine laboratory tests in order to identify patients at risk of fatal complications and those who will potentially benefit from anti-il6 immunotherapies with tocilizumab 7 however as costly cytokine analysis is not routinely performed in most laboratories surrogate markers of infection ferritin c-reactive protein crp correlated to il-6 will be of increasing interest for prognostic value beyond d-dimer prothrombin time pt and fibrin degradation product fdp 1 there are no specific predictive parameters of severe ischemic and thrombo-embolic disease for this reason it is not easy to cluster patients in risk categories for an appropriate early anticoagulant or fibrinolytic therapyaccording to the most recently published diagnosis and treatment program of 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia trial version seven 8 covid-19 patients are divided into mild moderate severe and critical classifications some hematological parameters including white blood cell wbc lymphopenia crp and some biochemical parameters such as ldh creatine kinase ck and troponin were reported to be associated with covid-19 severity 910concerning new predictive parameters of specific cardiovascular risk very recent data report that homocysteine hcy together with age monocytelymphocyte ratio mlr and period from disease onset to hospital admission may be a specific cardiovascular risk predictive parameter for severe pneumonia observed at chest computed tomography ct during the first week of covid-19 infection however these observations did not report any additional organ involvement 11 the aim of this review is to report the current state of knowledge regarding known biomarkers for covid-19 infection focusing on those potentially predictive of organ damage in patients with severe complications and deaththe knowledge of molecular mechanisms related to virus damage on human cells is necessary to define efficacious pharmacologic strategies and to identify novel biomarkers predictive of severe cardiovascular damage or fatalitythe main mechanism for sars-cov-2 infection is the binding of the virus to membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and the internalization of complex by the host cellace2 a glycoprotein and metalloprotease exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms 12 the membrane-bound form contains a transmembrane domain which anchors its extracellular domain to the plasma membrane whereas in its soluble form it is cleaved and secreted as the n-terminal ectodomain is barely measurable in circulationthe significance of circulating ace2 is unclear although levels may be increased in chronic diseases such as diabetes chronic kidney disease ckd and hypertension 1314 ace2 has kinins apelin neurotensin dynorphin ghrelin amyloid and angiotensin as substrates the main function of ace2 is to physiologically counterbalance ace and regulate angiotensin ii ang ii by converting ang i into ang-1-9 and by converting ang ii into ang-1-7 which is tissue-protective 15recently it has been demonstrated that the receptor-binding domain in the novel coronavirus spike s protein binds strongly to ace2 receptors 16 sars-cov-2 uses ace2 and the serine protease tmprss2 for s protein priming ace2 and tmprss2 are not only expressed in lung but also in the small intestinal epithelia in the upper esophagus liver colon 17 in organs involved in blood pressure regulation blood vessels heart kidneys as well as in the ovaries and testes 15 this wide distribution of the covid-19 receptor could provoke systemic failure due to direct organ injury 18an additional sars-cov-2 mechanism of action was suggested by wenzhong and hualan who demonstrated that the open reading frame orf8 and surface glycoprotein may both bind to the porphyrin at the same time orf1ab orf10 and orf3a proteins are presumed to coordinate an attack on the heme of the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin to dissociate the iron forming the porphyrin and reducing the capacity of hemoglobin to carry oxygen and carbon dioxide 19 not peer-reviewed this mechanism of the virus inhibits the normal metabolic pathway of heme and provokes disease symptomatologygreater consensus exists on the pathogenetic mechanisms triggered by covid-19 after entering the human body inflammatory cascades cytokine storms and the activation of coagulation cascades these are common in systemic vasculitis pulmonary renal and cerebral and lead to severe and even fatal complications such as sepsis disseminated intravascular coagulation dic and acute cardiovascular eventsdic has been identified in the majority of sars-cov-2 infected deceased patients patients with viral infection may develop sepsis associated with organ dysfunction dic most commonly caused by sepsis develops when monocytes and endothelial cells are activated and following injury cytokines are released with the expression of tissue factor and the secretion of von willebrand factor free thrombin uncontrolled by natural anticoagulants can activate platelets and stimulate fibrinolysis at late stages of novel coronavirus pneumonia ncp fibrin-related markers d-dimer and fdp were reported to be moderately or markedly elevated in all sars-cov-2 deaths suggesting a common coagulation activation and secondary hyperfibrinolysis in these patients 1hematologic biomarkers used to stratify covid-19 patients include wbc count lymphocyte count neutrophil count neutrophillymphocyte ratio nlr platelet count eosinophil count and hemoglobinyang et al 20 reported lymphopenia in 80 of critically ill adult covid-19 patients whereas chen et al 4 reported a rate of only 25 of patients with mild covid-19 infection these observations suggest that lymphopenia may correlate with infection severity qin et al analyzed markers related to dysregulation of immune response in a cohort of 450 covid-19 positive patients reporting that severe cases tended to have lower lymphocyte- higher leukocyte-counts and higher nlr as well as lower percentages of monocytes eosinophils and basophils compared to mild cases 21 similarly henry et al also concluded in a meta-analysis on 21 studies including 3377 covid-19 positive patients that patients with severe and fatal disease had significantly increased wbc and decreased lymphocyte and platelet counts compared to non-severe disease and survivors 22in covid-19 patients both helper t cells and suppressor t cells were below normal levels with the lowest helper t cells levels associated with severe cases further in severe cases the percentage of nave helper t cells were reportedly increased and memory helper t cells were reportedly decreased patients with covid-19 also have lower level of regulatory t cells which are more obviously damaged in severe cases 2123 cytotoxic lymphocytes such as cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls and natural killer nk cells are necessary for the control of viral infection and the functional exhaustion of cytotoxic lymphocytes is correlated with disease progression 24 on confirmed covid-19 cases laboratory testing showed that mean lymphocyte counts were below normal 32527 changes in lymphocyte populations in patients severely affected by covid19 indicate a low t cells count an increase in nave helper t cells and a decrease in memory helper t cells 23 the total number of nk t cells and b cells was decreased markedly in patients with sars-cov-2 infection 212829 lower cd8 t cells count tended to be an independent predictor for covid-19 severity and treatment efficacy 29 xu et al reported that a decrease of specific t lymphocyte subsets is related to in-hospital death and severe illness lower counts of t lymphocyte subsets lymphocyte 500l cd3  t-cell 200l cd4 t-cell 100l cd8 t-cell 100l and b-cell 50l were associated with higher risks of in-hospital death of covid-19 the warning values to predict in-hospital death of lymphocyte cd3 t-cell cd4 t-cell cd8 t-cell and b-cell were 559l 235l 104l 85l and 82l respectively 30in a study of 32 covid-19 patients decreased eosinophil count was registered in 66 31 eosinophil counts have been positively correlated to lymphocyte count r  0305 p  001 32 in another study of 140 covid-19 patients eosinopenia was reported in 529 002  109l and the eosinophil count was positively associated with lymphocyte count in mild r  0449 p001 and severe r  0486 p001 cases of covid-19 33 du et al reported very low eosinophil counts in 812 patients at admission which may indicate poor prognosis 9 liu et al also reported low eosinophil values on initial hospitalization which reportedly returned to normal before discharge concluding that increasing eosinophils may be an indicator of clinical covid-19 improvement 34 however results from a systematic literature review concluded that eosinopenia may not be associated with unfavorable progression of covid-19 35 therefore the diagnostic value of eosinopenia in covid-19 requires further investigation with larger patient cohorts to establish the sensitivity and specificity of the eosinophil countthe nlr calculated simply by the ratio of neutrophils countlymphocytes count is an inflammatory marker that can predict the probability of death in patients with various cardiovascular diseases 3637 moreover nlr has been identified in a meta-analysis as a prognostic biomarker for patients with sepsis 38 for covid-19 patients nlr has been shown to be an independent risk factor for severe disease 3941 fifty 758 patients with disease progression during hospitalization had a nlr 2973 42 which may indicate covid-19 infection severity 43 binary logistic analysis identified elevated nlr hazard risk hr 246 95 confidence interval ci 198457 as an independent factor for poor covid-19 clinical outcome 44 which was confirmed by a meta-analysis which reported that nlr values were significantly increased in severe covid19 patients 45 nlr elevation may be due to dysregulated expression of inflammatory cytokines aberrant increase of pathological low-density neutrophil and the upregulation of genes involved in lymphocyte cell death pathway caused by the mechanism of sars-cov-2 infection 46lymphopenia excessive activation of the inflammatory cascade and cardiac involvement are all crucial features of covid-19 disease and have high prognostic value however the understanding of the underlying mechanisms is still limited 47 based on the observations derived from clinical practice it has also been postulated that coronaviruses may directly infect bone marrow precursors resulting in abnormal hematopoiesis or trigger an auto-immune response against blood cells 4849as platelet count is a simple cheap and easily available biomarker and has been independently associated with disease severity and mortality risk in intensive care unit icu 5052 it has been rapidly adopted as a potential biomarker for covid-19 patients the number of platelets was reported to be significantly reduced in covid-19 patients 1153 and was lower in non-survivor patients compared to survivors 54 low platelet count has been associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality for covid-19 patients and can serve as an indicator of clinical disease worsening during hospitalization 55 another research group found that patients with severe pneumonia induced by sars-cov2 had higher platelet count than those induced by non-sars-cov2 56 the patients with significantly elevated platelets and higher platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio plr during treatment had longer average hospitalization days 57 damaged lung tissue and pulmonary endothelial cells may activate platelets in the lungs resulting in the aggregation and formation of microthrombi thereby increasing platelet consumption 58in severe disease wbcs show lymphocytopenia affecting both cd4 and cd8 cells as well as a decrease in monocytes and eosinophils and a clear increase in neutrophils and nlr these simple parameters can be used for early diagnosis and identification of critically ill patients 5960the main laboratory changes in severe or fatal covid-19 patients were recently explored in a meta-analysis including three large studies comparing survivors to non-survivors a significant increase in total bilirubin and ck together with serum ferritin wbc count and il-6 was registered in non-survivors compared to survivors 202661 further given the strong association between thrombo-embolism and covid 19 and to a lesser extent myocardial injury d-dimer and cardiac markers are crucial in covid-19 patient monitoringmarkers of muscular and in particular cardiac injury were elevated in patients with both severe and fatal covid-19 at presentation non-survivors had significantly higher cardiac troponin levels weighted mean difference wmd 327 ngl which is probably due to both viral myocarditis and cardiac injury from disease progression to multiple organ failure mof in mof significant elevation in liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase alt and aspartate aminotransferase ast is associated with critical changes in renal function parameters blood urea nitrogen creatinine and coagulation markers 60chen et al observed in a cohort of 799 patients 113 non-survivors and 161 recovered markedly higher concentrations of alt ast creatinine ck ldh cardiac troponin i n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and d-dimer in non-survivors compared to recovered patients 62 du et al in a prospective study of 179 patients with covid-19 pneumonia including 21 non-survivors identified cardiac troponin i  005 ngml as among the four risk factors predictive of mortality age 65 years preexisting concurrent cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases cd3  cd8 t cells  75 celll 9liver function has also been identified as an important predictor for covid-19 patient mortality a recent study suggested that sars-cov-2 may directly bind to ace2-positive cholangiocytes and therefore liver abnormalities in covid-19 patients may be due to cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug-induced and systemic inflammatory response-induced liver injuries 63 regarding the specific and dynamic pattern of liver injury parameters lei et al in a wide retrospective multicenter study involving a covid-19 cohort-derived data set of 5771 patients reported that ast is strongly associated with mortality risk compared to other parameters reflecting liver injury 64 this evidence is in contrast with the evidence of alt elevation in other hepatitis-induced liver injurypct a glycoprotein is the pro-peptide of calcitonin devoid of hormonal activity under normal circumstances it is produced in the c-cells of the thyroid gland in healthy humans pct levels are undetectable   01 ngml during severe infection bacterial parasitic and fungal with systemic manifestations pct levels may rise to over 100 ngml produced mostly by extra-thyroid tissue 69 although its biological action is largely unknown the sequence homologies between pct and other human cytokines such as tnf- family il-6 etc support the hypothesis that pct is a mediator of inflammation 70the synthesis of pct can be increased as a result of endotoxins andor cytokines eg il-6 tnf- and il-1b the extra-thyroid synthesis of pct has been found to occur in the liver pancreas kidney lung intestine and within leukocytes however the synthesis of pct has been shown to be suppressed within these tissues in the absence of bacterial infection in contrast cytokines such as interferon inf- which are released following viral infection lead to down-regulation of pct thus highlighting another advantage of pct assays 71 pct levels are either unmodified or only moderately increased in systemic inflammatory response to viral or to noninfectious stimuli non-viral infections therefore pct values were more discriminative than wbc count and crp in distinguishing a bacterial infection from another inflammatory process 72 as for covid-19 patients more severe cases showed a more marked increase of pct compared with non-severe cases 337376 a slight increase much less than 05 ngml in pct levels is an important indicator to distinguish between sars-cov-2-positive and sars-cov-2-negative patients 77 and increased pct values have been associated with a nearly fivefold higher risk of severe sars-cov-2 infection odds ratio or 476 95 ci 274829 pct value remains within reference ranges in patients with non-complicated sars-cov-2 infection any substantial increase reflects bacterial co-infection and the development of a severe form of disease and a more complicated clinical picture 78 pct elevation has also been found in pediatric cases with lower respiratory tract infection reflecting bacterial co-infection 79although initial pct value may be helpful in the determination of illness severity it may not always be a reliable prognostic indicator as pct values may be influenced by preexisting comorbid conditions such as ckd and congestive heart failure baseline values may be high however pct can provide invaluable information if considered within the clinical context 80abnormal coagulation parameters are associated with poor prognosis specifically markedly elevated d-dimer and fdp are common in covid-19 non-survivor patients 1d-dimer appears to be frequently increased in patients with covid-19 3643 81 and may be related to severe complications and death however currently the interpretation of d-dimer during disease monitoring is unclear as it may not be directly related to disease severity similarities may exist with troponins 8 whose range does not always correspond to acute cardiac ischemia not all increases in cardiac troponin require invasive assessments in the absence of clinical symptoms 8283 however in some large-scale studies pt has been shown to be correlated to disease severity in a retrospective study involving 296 covid-19 patients with 17 non-survivors the non-survivor group had higher d-dimer and thrombin time and lower aptt than the survivor group 84 in a retrospective multicenter cohort study including 191 covid-19 patients who had either been discharged or had died factors associated with non-survival were pt high-sensitive cardiac troponin i ck and d-dimer 61 wang et al showed that 58 of patients with covid-19 had prolonged pt 68 tang et al investigated 207 non-survivor covid-19 patients and revealed that non-survivors had remarkably higher d-dimer and fdp levels and longer pt at admission compared with survivors 1the activation of coagulation processes reaches its peak in the dic which appeared to occur before most of the covid-19 positive patients death in fact such patients may evolve to sepsis which is one of the most common causes of dic dic is the result of activation of monocytes and endothelial cells to release cytokines following injury with expression of tissue factor and secretion of von willebrand factor circulation of free thrombin uncontrolled by natural anticoagulants can activate platelets and stimulate fibrinolysis at the late stages of ncp levels of fibrin-related markers d-dimer and fdp are moderately or markedly elevated in all deaths suggestive of a common coagulation activation and secondary hyperfibrinolysis conditionthis evidence could explain the rapid disease progression to death and the limited efficacy of mechanical ventilation in the treatment of covid-19 patients ards mechanical ventilation protocols are not always of significant benefit and may even cause additional lung damage conversely the rapid and positive response of some patients to full anti coagulation therapy can be explainedterpos et al showed that blood hypercoagulability is common among hospitalized covid-19 patients they reported that coagulation abnormalities in pt aptt fdp and d-dimer along with severe thrombocytopenia are associated with life-threatening dic which necessitates continuous vigilance and prompt intervention 85 in large scale studies d-dimer and pt have been found to be associated with severe disease and death 6186hcy has been under a lot of speculation since its discovery in 1932 the heating of the amino acid methionine with sulfuric acid led to this amino acid of interest 87high plasma levels of hcy significantly increase the incidence of vascular damage in both small and large vessels 8889 concentrations above the 90th percentile are associated with increased risk of degenerative and atherosclerotic processes 90 in the coronary cerebral and peripheral circulatory systems although hcy is an effective cardiovascular risk biomarker and the cardiovascular complications are critical in hospitalized covid-19 patients this parameter has not been adopted and studied in this clinical setting and in neither of the published prospective studies focused on laboratory markers useful for clinical evaluation of covid-19the definition of hyperhomocysteinemia differs between studies 91 hyperhomocysteinemia is defined as a medical condition characterized by an abnormally high level 15 moll of hcy in the blood 92 total concentration of hcy in plasma of healthy humans fasting is low between 50 and 150 moll when assessed with the use of high-performance liquid chromatography hplc or 50120 moll when immunoassay methods are used 93 when the level is between 16 and 30 moll it is classified as moderate 31100 moll is considered as intermediate and a value 100 moll is classified as severe hyperhomocysteinemia 8794 recent observations related hyperhomocysteinemia to cardiovascular disease diabetes ckd and fatty liver disease 919294very recent data demonstrated a predictive value of hcy together with age mlr and period from disease onset to hospital admission for severe pneumonia on chest ct at first week from covid-19 patients but did not report on additional organ involvement 11 in the same study the authors reported that mlr was significantly higher in imaging progression patients compared to that in imaging progression-free ones p  001ace2 functions as a regulator of the reninangiotensin system ras modulating endogenous levels of ang i and ang ii ang ii levels were found to be significantly increased in the kidneys hearts and plasma of ace2 null mice 95 the level of ang ii was also significantly increased in the avian influenza a infected patients indicating that ang ii is a biomarker for lethality in flu infections 9697 a strong correlation has been found between increases in il-6 and vascular macrophage accumulation and the degree of endothelial dysfunction produced by ang ii 98in an animal model ace2 and ang-1-7 infusion were shown to be protective via downregulation of rhoarho kinase rock pathway this pathway is deeply involved in changes of vascular tone and structure leading to hypertension and cardiovascular-renal remodeling and it has a relevant role in the induction of lung fibrosis 99ace2 converts ang ii to ang-1-7 and ang i to ang-1-9 ang-1-7 and ang-1-9 produce biological effects through the mas receptor masr and at2 receptor at2r respectively ang-1-7 induces regional and systemic vasodilation diuresis and natriuresis ang-1-9 increases nitric oxide no bioavailability by stimulating bradykinin bk release 100 activation of these pathways mediates anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects leading to cardiovascular renal-protective actions and acute lung injury protection 101102alamandine is generated by the catalytic action of ace2 on ang a or through a decarboxylation reaction on ang-1-7 in the n-terminal aspartate amino acid residue alamandine produces the same effects as ang-1-7 such as vasodilation and antifibrosis 103 it modulates peripheral and central blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular remodeling 104mechanistic evidence from related coronaviruses suggests that sars-cov-2 infection may downregulate ace2 leading to toxic over-accumulation of ang ii that induces ards and fulminant myocarditis 105 the ang ii level in the plasma samples from sars-cov-2 infected patients was markedly elevated and linearly associated to viral load and lung injury 106up to date there are no data regarding ang-1-7 ang-1-9 and alamandine plasma levels in covid-19 patients following the loss of ace2 function due to the role of ace2 as the viral binding site by sars-cov-2 we expect elevated level of ang ii and lower levels of ang-1-7 ang-1-9 and alamandine in severely infected patients than in mild onesa large proportion of the primary research is based on asian patients therefore further verification is needed in populations in other areas some biomarkers such as hcy have been evaluated in a few scientific reports and further analysis is needed in a large cohort of covid-19 patients there appears to be geographic variability in the percentage of patients with lymphopenia as shown in a retrospective study 107 further investigations should be done to assess this geographic variability this is a review of the current scientific literature with no statistical outcome measures therefore these results may not be generalizable to all populations finally with covid-19 being a very novel disease many clinical studies are still ongoing or undergoing publicationsince the emergency pandemic situation began it is of high scientific significance to analyze the discriminative ability of hematologic biochemical inflammatory and immunologic biomarkers in patients with and without the severe or fatal forms of covid-19 it is necessary to determine risk categories following covid-19 diagnosis to ensure an optimal resource allocation and to improve clinical management and prevention of serious complicationsto sum up we can conclude from the analysis of published studies that hematological lymphocyte count neutrophil count and nlr inflammatory crp esr il-6 and especially biochemical d-dimer troponins ck parameters correlate with severe prognosis or exitus in covid-19 patients and can therefore be used as predictive biomarkers coagulation and liver parameters might play a crucial role in identifying severe cases of covid-19understanding the weight of the pathophysiological processes of systemic cardiovascular damage vasculitis dic myocardial infarction and metabolic processes associated to the critical course of the infection also thanks to autopsy cohorts 68108110 sets new light on biochemical biomarkers related to coagulation disorders these are in fact not only predictive of disease severity but are also helpful for the therapeutic management based on drugs preventing the activation of coagulation processes a laboratory score taking into account hematological inflammatory biochemical and immunological parameters would help to stratify covid-19 positive patients into risk categories which would be of outmost importance in the clinical setting and therapeutic managementin addition to above discussed laboratory parameters which are currently used in clinical practice novel biomarkers potentially useful for screening clinical management and prevention of serious complications are under investigation these include hcy ang ii ang-1-7 ang-1-9 and alamandine which need to be evaluated in larger case series in order to clearly determine their predictive clinical value as indicators of severe prognosis in covid-19

rna although this treatment stimulated rig-i mimicking rna virus infection analogous sensors for dna viruses trigger many of the same downstream signals 28consistent with previous studies of airway epithelial cells responding to viral infection transcriptional changes were dominated by interferon-stimulated genes isgs figure 1 and supplementary table s1 these include mrnas associated with respiratory virus infection in other sample types andor patient populations including ifit genes oas genes and rsad2viperin 6 8 13 29 figure 1 highlights highly induced transcripts evaluated as potential biomarkers in this study these include multiple chemokines small secreted proteins that function as chemoattractants to recruit cells of the immune system to infected tissues transcripts that encode secreted proteins were of particular interest because they could potentially serve as biomarkers of viral infection at both the rna and protein levels and therefore could be useful for developing both pcr-based and immunoassay-based diagnostic testsnext we investigated whether a transcriptional signature based on 3 of the identified mrnas could predict viral infection in nasopharyngeal swabs we performed rt-qpcr for biomarkers on rna isolated from 68 np swabs sent to the ynhh lab for respiratory virus testing chart review revealed that most patients were older adults

tested positive for known respiratory viruses on the 9-virus ynhh panel table 1 figure 2a the ynhh virus panel does not include coronaviruses cov therefore we tested rna from all patient samples using a previously described multiplex assay for 4 cov genotypes 25 868 specimens were positive for coronavirus oc43 strikingly all 5 of the biomarker-positive virus panel-negative samples were positive for cov-oc43 indicated by asterisks next to bars in virus panel figure 2a and the other cov detections were codetections in samples positive for other virusesas shown in figure 2b the overall diagnostic

conventional and the mrna signature testing figure 2c indicating the great potential for a single host-based test to capture infection by diverse virusesbased on chart review 8 patients had findings indicative of nonviral infection see supplementary table s2 seven were virus negative these 7 patients were also negative for the host mrna signature described in figure 2 in addition 1 patient had radiological evidence of bacterial infection and sputum culture was positive for pseudomonas this patient also tested positive for coronavirus oc43 and for the host signature for viral infection described in figure 2 although this study was not designed to assess nonviral infection these data suggest that the host response signature in figure 2 is specific for viral infection and is not triggered by or inhibited by other infection typesto further evaluate the usefulness of cxcl10 andor cxcl11 proteins in predicting respiratory virus infection we measured levels of both proteins in viral transport medium in a second set of stored samples from december 2016 patients were primarily older adults 72 of patients over the age of 50 and also included young children 15 of patients vs 6 in study 1 supplementary figures s1 and s3 cxcl10 and cxcl11 concentrations correlated highly with viral infection figure 4a samples were initially tested for the 9-virus panel and covs as in study 1 then results were compared to biomarker levels because several virus-negative samples had very high levels of cxcl10 or cxcl11 we further expanded the test panel by testing for parainfluenza virus type 4 piv4 three samples tested positive for piv4 including 2 samples with high levels of cxcl10 and cxcl11 in which no other virus was detected figure 4a shows an expanded view of the 40 samples with the highest levels of cxcl11 detected viruses that were not in the original test panel table 1 are indicated with an asterisk we also observed cxcl11-low samples with viruses detected figure 4a rhinovirus was detected in the 3 virus-positive samples with the lowest concentrations of cxcl11 further analysis of rv-positive samples in study 2 revealed a correlation between cxcl11 and cxcl10 and the level of rv rna detected by rt-qpcr with the chemokine-low samples also having lower levels of rv supplementary figure s4overall 65151 of samples 43 were positive for 10 distinct viruses including influenza a and b and cov-oc43 and cov-229e and either cxcl11 or cxcl10 level was an excellent predictor of virus-positive and virus-negative status cxcl11 area under the curve auc  0889 95 ci

prevalent in study 1 figures 2c and 4c these findings reveal that cxcl10 or cxcl11 concentration can predict infection with diverse viruses
figure 5 shows the cxcl11 protein concentration in 219 samples study 1 plus study 2 sorted from highest to lowest concentration with bars in the virus column indicating virus detections as shown high cxcl11 levels correlated strongly with virus detection and low levels correlated with absence of virus with intermediate levels being indeterminate based on this pattern it is possible to envision developing a rule-inrule-out test using a high cutoff above which samples are predicted to be virus positive and below which samples are predicted to be virus negative dashed grey lines in figure 5 represent cutoffs of 80 pgml for rule-in which in this sample set would have a positive predictive value ppv of 90 or a cutoff of 50 pgml with a ppv of 86 dotted black lines indicate a low cutoff of 10 pgml below which this test has a negative predictive value of 94 for absence of virus infection using cutoffs of 80 pgml and 10 pgml about 13 of the samples 35 fall into the indeterminate zone consistent with the observations from each study figures 3 and 4a we observed a high degree of correlation between cxcl10 and cxcl11 protein concentrations supplementary figure s5 for 219 samples r2

in figure 5 either cxcl11 or cxcl10 measurements could be used to rule inrule out virus infection in sum these results demonstrate how an immunoassay-based test measuring a single host protein could have high diagnostic utility for managing patients with suspected respiratory infectionin this study we tested whether mrnas and proteins associated with np swabs could be used to predict the detection of a respiratory virus in samples sent to our hospital laboratory for conventional virology testing we chose possible biomarkers based on transcripts strongly induced by a virus-like stimulus in primary nasal epithelial cells in vitro the 3 mrnas we selected all showed predictive value for viral infection in np swabs surprisingly we were also able to identify high-performing biomarkers detectable at the protein level by testing chemokines indicated by the in vitro experimentthe mrna and protein biomarkers we identified are all molecules known to be associated with the antiviral interferon response a key host defense response to both rna and dna viruses in which viral recognition leads to interferon secretion and induction of approximately 300 different antiviral effectors 30 while this result is not unexpected interferon-stimulated genes have diverse regulatory mechanisms are differentially expressed in different host tissues and are differentially antagonized by different viruses therefore identifying which ones performed best as pan-viral infection biomarkers in the upper respiratory tract required empirical testinginterestingly although many different chemokines were induced by rig-i stimulation in vitro only 1 family of chemokines correlated highly with viral infection in np swab samples the cxcr3 ligands cxcl9 cxcl10 and cxcl11 these ligands mediate chemotaxis of t cells to sites of viral infection 31 the consistent correlation of these chemokines with presence of diverse respiratory viruses in np swabs suggests a particularly robust and conserved role for these chemokines in local antiviral defense of the upper respiratory tractwe were able to identify accurate mrna and protein-based tests we defined an mrna signature with very high diagnostic accuracy by combining the information from 3 biomarkers figure 2 accuracy of 97 95 ci 90100 sensitivity 91 specificity 100 this test compares favorably with a recently reported mrna-based index correlating viperin mrna levels to viral infection 13 technologies to support practical tests based on measuring host transcripts are under active development 32 importantly our findings showed that np swab-associated cxcl10 or cxcl11 protein concentrations can also serve as biomarkers of viral infection immunoassays are already widely used in diagnostic testing and these findings open up new possibilities for developing practical tests for diverse patient care settings including point-of-carenotably we did observe some discordant samples biomarker-negative virus-positive samples could represent infections that are not currently part of an active disease process recent studies show that while host antiviral responses can be detected in the respiratory tract of asymptomatic virus-infected subjects the magnitude of transcriptional response and possibly the presence of a response at the protein level is greater in symptomatic than asymptomatic subjects 13 3335 consistently analysis of rhinovirus-positive samples in study 2 showed a clear correlation between low cxcl11 and low viral load supplementary figure s4 biomarker-positive virus-negative samples could represent infections with untested viruses applying technologies such as deep sequencing for viral identification could provide greater estimates of biomarker accuracy in future studies 36 it will also be important to rule out nonviral biological processes leading to biomarker elevation for example elevated cxcr3 chemokines have been reported in chronic respiratory diseases 37 encouragingly our initial results indicate specificity of the biomarker test for virus infection in this population in study 1 1668 235 of patients had copd or asthma and 11 of these patients were virus negative these patients also tested virus negative by the host mrna biomarker signature figure 2in future studies it will be important to explore the performance of these biomarkers in different patient populations and clinical settings this study focused on the patients undergoing respiratory virus testing in our health care system largely older adults and some young children in this patient population biomarker-based testing could provide a simple cost-effective method to rule inrule out of viral infection as the cause of symptoms andor determine which patients require additional virology testing if these biomarkers perform well in outpatients with acute upper respiratory infection it is possible to imagine transformative new tests to aid in rapid diagnosis of these common illnesses and promote antimicrobial stewardship for example a pan-viral biomarker could potentially be paired with an analogous biomarker of bacterial respiratory infection to distinguish among viral infection bacterial infection and viralbacterial coinfection in study 1 we observed that nonviral infections did not trigger the virus host response signature supplementary table s2 indicating the potential feasibility of this approachin addition biomarker-based tests offer other advantages over traditional virology panels this includes identifying patients infected with unexpected viruses for example in this study biomarkers identified samples positive for viruses that were not in the original 9-virus test panel see figures 2 and 4 bars indicated by asterisks in virus column this illustrates how biomarker tests could be employed for surveillance for unexpected viruses including emerging respiratory viruses also biomarker-based tests offer promise for distinguishing incidental virus detections from active viral infection an issue coming into focus as incidental respiratory virus detections are increasingly recognized to be highly prevalent in asymptomatic subjects 13 33 35 38 39in sum our results show that biomarkers of the antiviral response are robustly detected using nasopharyngeal swabs including protein biomarkers detected with immunoassay and that even single biomarkers detected using this minimally invasive sample type offer high diagnostic accuracy these results compel further study of using nasopharyngeal biomarkers for improving our understanding of hostvirus interactions and for improving the diagnosis and management of patients with respiratory illnessa new strain of coronavirus cov caused a pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in china hong kong singapore toronto and taiwan from 2002 to 2003 resulting in 8098 individuals being infected and 774 deaths 1 as compared to other upper viral respiratory infections 2 sars-cov can rapidly induce pneumonia the accompanying adult respiratory distress syndrome can quickly progress resulting in rapid death of the patients 34 the most commonly used laboratory diagnostic tests for sars-cov-infection are reverse transcription rt-pcr and anti-sars-cov antibody serological tests 57 but their roles in monitoring the extent of pneumonia are rather limited although serial chest radiography is helpful for monitoring the progress of disease 89 it is also limited by its subjectivity and variability in the interpretation of the imaging results and occasionally suboptimal quality of portable films taken in isolation ward to avoid the spread of the disease in a recent article the discovery of 12 up-or downregulated serum biomarkers were reported in sars patients by a novel protein chip array profiling approach 1014 with one biomarker appears to be useful in monitoring the extent of pneumonia 15 in this chapter how this protein chip array profiling technique is carried out is described the technique involves four steps with the first step being serum fractionation in ceramic ion exchange sorbent beads this step separates serum proteins into several fractions aiming at reducing their complexity before protein chip profiling is performed the second step involves the binding of serum protein biomarkers onto protein chip array surfaces the third step is desorption of bound serum biomarkers by laser shots in the mass spectrometer generating a time of flight spectrum for each sample the fourth step concerns with data acquisition data processing and statistical analyses of the spectra in sars patients in comparison with the control groups these procedures will be described in full details in the following chapter and summarized in the flow chart diagram as in fig 1

in early december 2019 the coronavirus disease covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 first emerged in wuhan china 1 on january 31st 2020 the world health organisation declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern and on march 11th 2020 it was finally characterised as a pandemic 2 as of may 10th 2020 a total of over 4 million covid-19 cases and 280000 deaths have been reported globally reflecting the raised infectivity and severity of this virus yet the lack of widespread testing availability means these figures are likely even higher than reported 3 it is therefore important to predict the risk of morbidity and mortality especially in vulnerable patientssars-cov-2 is an enveloped non-segmented single-stranded positive-sense rna virus belonging to the coronaviridae family 4 sars-cov-2 is a zoonotic virus not too dissimilar to the sars-cov outbreak of 2002 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus of 2012 5678 this novel coronavirus enters cells via binding of the viral surface spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace 2 protein 9 ace2 is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells providing the route of entry for the virus 10 in addition ace2 is also widely present in the myocardium which has raised concerns due to the possibility of direct viral infection of the cardiovascular system 10although covid-19 patients present primarily with symptoms of respiratory disease and therefore follow a pneumonia-like treatment plan it is essential that the cardiovascular system is not ignored and to recognise those presenting with early signs of acute myocardial injury of the patients hospitalised for covid-19 thus far the prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities has been staggering based on early reports patients with cardiovascular disease cvd may represent 25 of those in an intensive care unit icu plus those with hypertension accounting for 58 of patients 11 additionally zhou et al found that myocardial injury defined by raised serum cardiac troponin i ctni levels in covid-19 patients was associated with over 50 mortality rate 12 furthermore heart failure was prevalent in 23 of patients presenting with covid-19 which was also more prevalent amongst patients who died compared to those who survived 519 vs 117 12 this demonstrates how essential it is to recognise those presenting with early signs of acute myocardial injury and to initiate a more intensive treatment planbased on these observations several theories surrounding the interplay between the pathophysiology of covid-19 and the cardiovascular system have been postulated 1314 namely covid-19 may exacerbate cardiovascular risk factors and preexisting cvd or may increase susceptibility for the development of new cardiovascular complications alternatively cvd or myocardial injury may predispose to worse outcomes in covid-19 patients which is reflected by a number of studies whereby established cvd is associated with more severe covid-19 leading to higher morbidity and mortality with such staggering mortality rates reported it is fundamental during this time-sensitive covid-19 outbreak to identify patients with an increased risk of adverse cvd outcomes andor myocardial injury one may achieve this through laboratory investigations of biomarkers such as ctni brain natriuretic peptide bnp d-dimers and fibrinogenall of which reflect cardiovascular function and are used as diagnostic tools in addition to assessing the risk of cvd in patients 15161718 while these biomarkers are recognised for cvd there is an emerging prospect that they may aid prognosis in covid-19 especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or risk factors that predispose to worse outcomes this is crucial as the speed of deterioration of many covid-19 patients means any early biomarkers indicative of severe morbidity or mortality may then help prevent this rapid deterioration consequently the aim of this review is to identify cardiovascular prognostic factors associated with morbidity and mortality in covid-19 and to highlight considerations by summarising the evidence for utilising laboratory testing of biomarkers of cardiovascular performance in covid-19 to optimise outcomescovid-19 patients at risk of serious illness and icu admission tend to be older and to present with similar comorbidities including heart failure hypertension and coronary artery disease 121920 in a meta-analysis of 8 studies 46248 covid-19 patients in total cvd was reported as the third most prevalent comorbidity in covid-19 patients 5 95 ci 47 and patients with severe covid-19 symptoms had a higher risk of cvd or 342 95 ci 188622 21 whilst these results were limited by significant heterogeneity due to variations in the severity of covid-19 patients and follow-up period a similarly high prevalence of cvd in covid-19 patients 15 was observed in the study by huang and colleagues 121 notably yang and jin state that covid-19 patients with established cvd are susceptible to more adverse complicationsthese patients are therefore also at a greater risk of myocardial injury which mainly manifests as elevated serum ctni levels 22 ctni is a gold-standard necrotic biomarker for myocardial risk assessment worldwide 15 it is released virtually exclusively in the myocardium in the presence of myocardial injury irrespective of the mechanism of insult 15 other biomarkers of myocardial injury that are of diagnostic value include creatine kinase-myocardial band ck-mb and bnp which may provide insight into the severity of symptoms in covid-19 although they are already established for cvd results from emerging studies as discussed below elucidate the potential role of these biomarkers particularly ctni and cardiac troponin t ctnt as predictors of prognosis in covid-19 patients as shown in table 1the predictive potential of troponin proteins for severe morbidity in covid-19 patients has been demonstrated for instance huang et al reported a substantial elevation of ctni 28 phml in 5 out of 41 12 covid-19 patients 1 all 5 then developed acute myocardial injury and 4 out of the 5 were admitted into an icuthis allows the conceptualisation of ctni as a prognostic tool in other diseases such as covid-19 1 in addition a meta-analysis of 4 studies with 341 covid-19 patients reported a significantly higher ctni mean difference in patients with more severe covid-19 symptoms compared with patients with non-severe covid-19 presentation 256 ngl 95 ci 68445 ngl although heterogeneity was relatively high posing a limitation similar to the previously mentioned meta-analysis 23 nevertheless shi et al also identified that 82 out of 416 197 covid-19 patients presented with myocardial injury diagnosed by significantly raised serum ctni levels 19 amongst these patients there was a significantly higher mortality rate of 512 compared to a 45 mortality rate in those with normal ctni levels and no myocardial injury signifying the serious nature of myocardial injury in covid-19 patients 19 importantly it demonstrates the potential value of ctni in foreshadowing the outcomes of covid-19 patients the possible role of ctnt in covid-19 prognosis is also exemplified by guo et al who reported the elevation of ctnt levels in 52 out of 187 278 hospitalised covid-19 patients all of whom developed myocardial injury 20 in those 52 patients mortality was a staggering 596 compared to 89 in those patients with normal serum ctnt levels 20 whilst covid-19 patients with raised ctnt levels and established cvd had an alarming mortality rate of 694 those with raised serum ctnt levels but no history of cvd still had a relatively high mortality rate of 375 20 this indicates the prognostic value of detecting elevated ctnt levels in all covid-19 patients irrespective of the presence of underlying cvd conversely patients with normal serum ctnt levels and established cvd had a much lower mortality rate of 133 compared to the 596 rate in patients with elevated ctnt levels 20 interestingly guo et al also observed a significant positive linear correlation between serum ctnt and plasma c-reactive protein p  0001 suggesting a link between the severity of inflammation observed in covid-19 and myocardial injury 20 indeed several myocarditis autopsy findings of inflammatory mononuclear infiltrate in myocardial tissue have been reported in patients with high viral loadthese studies also further explore the changes in cardiac inflammatory markers during covid-19 manifestation 242526 it is therefore plausible that through these inflammatory changes there is an increased risk of myocardial injury which manifests as elevated serum ctnt levels and consequently leads to more severe symptoms whilst ctni and ctnt have demonstrated remarkable potential in predicting covid-19 outcomes bnp too has shown some prospect in the prognosis of covid-19 guo and colleagues found that raised ctnt levels were significantly associated with elevated serum bnp levels p  0001 20 they reported that alongside the gradual elevation of serum ctnt levels bnp levels likewise progressively increased in covid-19 patients whose health deteriorated contrasting the low and stable serum bnp levels in successfully discharged patients 20 similarly a case report presented the cardiac involvement in deterioration of a covid-19 patient without preexisting cvd whereby serum levels of bnp 5647 pgml ctnt 024 ngml and ck-mb 203 ngml were all elevatedthis patient was then admitted to the icu with myocarditis 27 moreover shi et al report significantly raised bnp levels in covid-19 patients with myocardial injury compared to those without 1689 pgml vs 139 pgml p  0001these patients consequently also had a high mortality rate of 512 19 as such the aforementioned findings in these studies are groundbreaking as they reflect the prospect of routinely measuring serum bnp levels in covid-19 patients at admission to reduce mortality and to prevent deterioration where possible in addition to ctni and bnp ck-mb may similarly hold prognostic value in covid-19 in the study by wang et al 36 out of 138 261 covid-19 patients were admitted to the icu with severe symptoms all of whom had significantly elevated serum ctni and ck-mb levels p  0004 and p  0001 respectively compared to non-icu patients 11 perhaps this implies that patients with more severe covid-19 symptoms have adverse outcomes of acute myocardial injuryreflected by the elevation in ck-mb and ctni levels likewise this study provides insight into the value of ck-mb along with ctni in categorising covid-19 patients with an increased risk of adverse outcomes and admission to icu for health deterioration the value of ck-mb and ctni in covid-19 is also exemplified in the study by zhou et al whereby a significant association between elevated ck-mb and ctni levels and in-hospital death was illustrated p  0043 and p  00001 respectively 12 similarly wan et al found that creatine kinase was significantly higher in covid-19 patients with severe symptoms compared to those with mild symptoms p  00016 28 these studies demonstrate the benefit of utilising ck-mb in determining the patients that require urgent interventionalthough bnp and ck-mb have evidently demonstrated some prognostic value in covid-19 it is important to highlight that in all studies measuring bnp or ck-mb ctni was also measured and it provided the same if not a clearer link between myocardial injury and covid-19 outcomes additionally contrasting findings are reported between studies regarding creatine kinase levels and severe covid-19 presentation for instance whilst wan et al found creatine kinase to be significantly elevated in covid-19 patients with severe symptoms huang et al found no significant difference in serum creatine kinase levels between icu and non-icu patients p  031 128 therefore more studies that clearly illustrate a conclusive link between ck-mb and bnp and covid-19 outcomes will provide a better understanding of their prognostic role it is through the lack of evidence in the literature that one therefore postulates ctni may be a preferred option compared to ck-mb and bnp mainly due to its high sensitivity in detecting worsening prognosis and myocardial injury in covid-19 patientsit is worth noting that raised serum ctni levels are similarly associated with a higher risk of mortality in other diseases such as pneumonia odds ratio  95 sepsis odds ratio  192 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hazard ratio  45 and acute respiratory distress syndrome hazard ratio  16 29303132 hence one may logically also predict a correlation between elevated serum ctni levels and a higher risk of mortality in covid-19 patients studies have clearly illustrated a significant difference in serum ctni levels between covid-19 patients who survived and those who died ctni levels provide novel insight into a multi-faceted prognostic use of ctni in other diseases than cvd as it has proven to be a reliable marker of mortality in the previously discussed studies during a crisis such as the current covid-19 pandemic measuring serum ctni levels may enable healthcare professionals to predict prognosis and to therefore avoid worsening outcomes in vulnerable patients by identifying them at an earlier stage and by providing them with an intensive treatment plan which tackles both the myocardial injury and covid-19 it has been clear from early reports in china that abnormal coagulation is associated with poor prognosis in covid-19 patients tang et al clearly illustrated this by retrospectively analysing the coagulation parameters of 183 hospitalised covid-19 patients 37 strikingly 7014 of non-survivors matched the diagnostic criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation dic in later stages of the disease according to the criteria described by the international society on thrombosis and haematosis 38 this contrasts with only one 06 survivor meeting the criteria hence abnormal coagulation is a principal factor involved in the deterioration and high mortality seen in covid-19 however it is less clear if coagulation parameters as seen in table 2 could be used to stratify patients on admission thus highlighting those more likely to develop severe disease in order to prompt swift intensive treatment thus far d-dimer has demonstrated promise in its ability to hold prognostic value in covid-19 patients wang et al conducted a retrospective single-centre case series including 138 patients with confirmed covid-19 11 those who were eventually admitted to icu had significantly increased d-dimer levels median d-dimer 414 mgl vs 166 mgl p  00001 on admission compared to those who avoided intensive treatment 11 this finding was substantiated by a smaller retrospective cohort study that found d-dimer levels were four times the upper limit of normal in patients subsequently admitted to the icu a level much higher than non-icu patients median d-dimer level 24 mgl vs 05 mgl p  00042 reference range  05 mgl 1 remarkably a multi-centre retrospective cohort study of 191 patients demonstrated that even after multi-variant analysis an increased d-dimer on admission was highly associated with in-hospital death or 1842 p  0003 12 furthermore 81 of those who did not survive had a d-dimer  1 gml on admission compared to just 24 of those who survived 12 this striking evidence greatly supports the prognostic ability of d-dimer however those still hospitalised at the end of the study were excluded thus only those who had died or been discharged during the study period were counted therefore this may have exaggerated the difference between the groups as only those with more severe disease at an earlier stage would be included in the analysis of those who died nonetheless in addition to d-dimer being raised on admission numerous studies from china have demonstrated that in non-survivors d-dimer continues to rise throughout the clinical course of the disease 1137 this is compared to a low and stable d-dimer in those who survived importantly an increased d-dimer was highly associated with acute myocardial injury diagnosed via a raised ctni which as mentioned previously has been correlated with an increased risk of in-hospital death 20 therefore it is reasonable to suggest that d-dimer has prognostic value when taken on admission and could also be used to highlight patients who are deteriorating however the practicalities of such an implementation would need to be considered for example whilst wan et al found that a raised d-dimer was associated with a more severe disease the median d-dimer level in the severe cases was still within the normal range on admission 28 this could present a barrier in confidently triaging patients on their d-dimer level if it is still below the cutoff although in this study of 135 patients there was only one fatality a death rate much lower than previously reported therefore the raised yet normal d-dimer could be explained by a relatively well cohortprothrombin time pt may also hold some predictive value in covid-19 patients contrasting evidence has surfaced concerning the association of an extended pt with admission to icu whilst a smaller retrospective cohort study found that those who were admitted to icu had a significantly longer pt on admission median pt 122 s vs 107 s p  0012 wang et al reported no significant difference 111 although of the 138 patients included in wang et als analysis a large proportion was still hospitalised and not discharged 616 11 therefore patients who were not admitted to icu may have deteriorated and subsequently required intensive care thus comparing patients by icu admission may be unreliable in this cohort nevertheless there is good evidence to support that a prolonged pt is associated with in-hospital death a large multi-centre retrospective cohort study found that a pt over 16 s was greatly associated with in-hospital death or 462 p  0019 whilst tang et al found that pt time was significantly increased in non-survivors median pt 155 s vs 136 s p  0001 12 tang et al also demonstrated that from admission pt continued to rise in those who did not survive supporting its association with in-hospital death 37 like d-dimer an increased pt was also associated with acute cardiac injury implying that abnormal coagulation parameters on admission are associated with myocardial injury 20 however as previously discussed the pathology of this injury whether infarction or myocarditis is still unclearsimilar trends have also been noted in platelet counts there was no difference in the platelet counts on admission of those admitted to icu 111 however a reduced platelet count was associated with in-hospital death and cardiac injury zhou et al reported a much lower platelet count in those who died median platelet count 1655  109l vs 2200  109l p  0001 with 20 of non-survivors having a platelet count less than 100  109l on admission compared to just 1 of those who survived 12 in addition those with raised ctni on admission had a significantly lower platelet count compared to those without cardiac injury median platelet count 172  103l vs 216  103l p  0001 this further illustrates that abnormal coagulation is associated with cardiac injury in hospitalised covid-19 patients 19 lastly a study of 183 patients found that fibrinogen degradation products fdp were also significantly raised on admission in patients that did not survive median fdp 76 gml vs 40 gml p  0001 37 whilst fibrinogen levels showed no significant difference on admission it was significantly lower in non-survivors in late hospitalisation 37 this suggests that a decreasing fibrinogen level is associated with the progression of the disease thus it may aid in the identification of deteriorating patients in light of the striking rate of dic in patients who did not survive it has been suggested that the use of heparin in covid-19 may be beneficial therefore tang et al conducted a retrospective analysis of covid-19 patients and found that the use of low molecular weight heparin was associated with improved prognosis in severe covid-19 cases with a markedly elevated d-dimer 39 this further supports the pivotal role that abnormal coagulation plays in the deterioration of covid-19 patients and how coagulation parameters may help in determining the prognosis of patients furthermore it demonstrates that a raised d-dimer may also aid treatment optimisation in severe cases of covid-19evidently coagulation parameters have demonstrated their prognostic potential in covid-19 patients however in all studies that demonstrated an association between covid-19 and coagulation markers d-dimer consistently provided the clearest link to icu admission and in-hospital death additionally as seen in table 2 it has been the most widely studied biomarker and thus may be the most reliable in predicting the outcome in covid-19 patientsas previously mentioned sars-cov-2 uses the ace2 receptor for entry into target cells found commonly in the lungs heart and vessels 10 ace converts angiotensin i to angiotensin ii which can then activate the angiotensin ii receptor type 1 40 angiotensin ii has profound effects not limited to the cardiovascular system including vasoconstriction the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 as well as pro-oxidative effects 414243 numerous studies have demonstrated that the use of ace inhibitors aceis and angiotensin ii receptor i blockers arbs lead to an increase in expression of the ace 2 receptor 40 this has sparked debate surrounding the use of aceiarbs due to potentially enhancing the risk of infection by increasing the entry way ace2interestingly it has been revealed recently that the plasma levels of angiotensin ii were raised in infected patients compared to that of healthy controls 26 this may be in part explained by the reduction of ace2 due to the binding and internalisation of the enzyme caused by the virus moreover the level of angiotensin ii in covid-19 patients was strongly associated with viral load and lung injury suggesting that covid-19 was causing an imbalance in the reninangiotensin system 26 this implies that angiotensin ii may be a mediator of the disease leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory or oxidative organ damage therefore it would be not unreasonable to suggest that the use of an acei or arb may be beneficial in the treatment of covid-19 whilst there have been no other studies to date to our knowledge this suggests that angiotensin ii could be used as a biomarker to stratify patients as those with higher angiotensin ii would have increased risk of organ failure thus requiring more intensive treatment furthermore this could provide an explanation for the increased risk of myocardial injury whilst hospitalised with covid-19 the powerful vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin ii may increase the demand on the heart whilst potentially inducing oxidative damage this risk of myocardial injury may then be further increased by the coagulative state mentioned previously however further studies are essential to support these findings especially when considering the small sample size of patients in the studybiomarkers of acute myocardial injury have evidently revealed their potential in predicting worsening prognosis for covid-19 patients with and without myocardial injury ctni provides remarkable prognostic value for patients at increased risk of worsening outcomes and in-hospital mortality though studies have also shown the association of raised ck-mb and bnp levels with more severe symptoms of covid-19 raised serum ctnt and ctni levels show a clear correlation with deteriorating health and increased mortality in patients with established cvd or cardiovascular risk factors and even in those presenting without a history of cvd as a result detecting elevated serum ctnt or ctni levels on admission as a routine procedure may be invaluable to reduce mortality and severe covid-19 patients during a time when icus are operating at maximum capacity additionally it may allow healthcare professionals to initiate intensive treatment in those vulnerable patients before covid-19 symptoms worsen collectively the evidence presented suggests a common coagulation activation in patients that die from covid-19 d-dimer has demonstrated predictive value for both icu treatment and in-hospital death when taken on admission furthermore fdp pt and platelets when taken on admission may also highlight those more likely to die in hospital therefore the measurement of coagulation parameters on admission may help in the assignment of scarce icu beds the continued activation of coagulation throughout the clinical course of non-survivors evidenced by an increasing d-dimer level and pt plus a decreasing fibrinogen level may help identify deteriorating patients that require extra support or palliative care furthermore plasma levels of angiotensin ii may offer a novel method of predicting disease severity also the pathogenic role of angiotensin ii in covid-19 and the potential use of acearbs needs to be more clearly elucidated nonetheless when considering the prognostic potential of these biomarkers it is poignant to contemplate whether they are causative in the deterioration of covid-19 or simply a consequence of disease progression additionally the mechanism concerning the abnormal biomarker levels should be elucidated for instance many of the markers of coagulation are raised in inflammatory or hepatic diseases and thus are nonspecific table 2 hence whilst it is clear that the body is in a pro-coagulative phase the cause of this is unclear further investigation into the role of these biomarkers may permit insight into the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 similarly the exact pathology of myocardial injury in covid-19 is unknown although this review has highlighted possible mechanisms to be explored firstly the high association with abnormal coagulation may suggest a causative link alternatively a common trigger such as angiotensin ii might instigate both coagulation activation and myocardial injury nevertheless more studies are required to elucidate the specific mechanism of myocardial injury and its association with severe inflammation in covid-19 along with the subsequent detrimental symptoms that often lead to mortality in vulnerable patientswhen reviewing the literature published thus far on covid-19 the requirement for multi-centre studies with larger cohorts and clinical power is abundantly clear furthermore due to the high demand for research to published numerous papers included in the review comprise of patients still not discharged from hospital consequently the data has incomplete endpoints thus reducing the potential clinical translation of their findings moreover the evidence presented only concerns patients presenting to hospital and further studies in outpatient primary care or community settings are required to get a full overview of the clinical severity and cardiovascular impactwhilst these cardiovascular biomarkers present excellent prognostic potential the implementation of their use should be considered these are routine blood tests done for many well-resourced hospitals hence minimal change in practice would be necessary to swiftly implement their use however for countries or hospitals with less clinical resources implementation may be challenging furthermore those less equipped are those most likely to benefit from a prognostic test that would aid in the assignment of scarce resources therefore the development of a rapid tests which could quickly determine an increase in prominent biomarkers may be extremely beneficial if this was distributed to countries or hospitals less equipped to treat covid-19 it could greatly support the global battle against this pandemictraditional technologies for the analysis of dna mrna and proteins can analyze only 1 parameter at a time and therefore are limited in throughput when a large number of parameters need to be identified the implementation of dna and protein microarrays has led to a tremendous acceleration in biomarker discovery the ultimate goal is to identify sets of disease-specific biomarkers and then to combine them with a robust screening technology this approach will allow clinicians to screen patients before prescribing a particular drug in order to exclude potential adverse effects or determine the most suitable dose besides making improvements to this new technology researchers must also identify and validate appropriate sets of biomarkers and subsequently integrate them into healthcare services fig 3 summarizes the work flow of biomarker discovery with protein microarrays and the anticipated application of protein microarraybased assays for personalized medicineprotein microarrays have recently demonstrated their huge potential in the field of biomarker discovery rppms have been used to identify biomarker candidates in cancer patients that show changes in concentration that correlate with the state and progression of disease 151617181920 sandwich immunoassays have proved to be an excellent method for accurately quantifying biomarker candidates multiplexing can easily be achieved with bead-based technologies high-throughput multiplexed immunoassays are perfectly suited for screening cancer biomarkers in a large cohort of clinical samples 2122 and provide insights into the details of the production of plasma or tissue proteins thereby furnishing detailed information about a patients physiological and pathologic condition the use of sophisticated bioinformatics tools allows the identification of biomarker patterns that can then be used for diagnostic purposes data sets generated with multiplexed immunoassays can be integrated into multivariate diagnostic models with such algorithms as k-nearest neighbor and logistic regression such analyses can markedly improve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of cancer diagnostics compared with what was previously possible with single-parameter analysis 232425 recently visintin et al used a 6-plex multiplexed sandwich immunoassay leptin prolactin osteopontin insulin-like growth factor ii macrophage inhibitory factor and cancer antigen 125 ca-125 to screen plasma from patients with ovarian cancer use of this 6-plex panel to screen samples from 362 healthy controls and 156 patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer screened achieved a 953 diagnostic sensitivity and a 994 diagnostic specificity 23 amonkar et al identified an 11-plex panel ca-125 ca 19-9 soluble epidermal growth factor receptor egfr c-reactive protein myoglobin apolipoprotein a1 apo a1 apo ciii macrophage inhibitory protein 1 mip-1 interleukin-6 il-6 il-18 and tenascin c and used it to distinguish plasma samples from patients with ovarian cancer from samples from patients with benign conditions the screening of 176 patients and 187 controls revealed that the 11-plex achieved a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity as high as 90 2425 in contrast a single parameter ca-125 currently achieves a diagnostic sensitivity of 60 in early stages of the disease 23 these candidate biomarker panels require further validation with larger patient cohorts however before they can reliably be used in routine clinical diagnostics the increasing list of biomarker candidates shows that protein microarrays have a huge potential to contribute to the development of individualized medical therapies the knowledge generated with such protein microarrays not only will help clinicians adapt therapies to individual patient requirements but also will help minimize the risk of adverse effects caused by an incorrectly chosen drug or drug dosethe data-driven approach involves a proteome-wide analysis to identify a correlation between protein concentrations and a particular disease state this approach is unbiased in that no assumptions are made about the proteins that might be involved in the disease process however the protein microarray approaches developed for global analysis of protein concentrations are still in their infancy combining the current antibody arrays with a direct sample-labeling strategy allows the analysis of only a limited number of parameters despite all the efforts made in recombinant antibody technology and classic antibody generation high-quality antibodies directed against every single protein of interest are still not available 2728nevertheless high-throughput techniques for protein analysis have been used to generate whole-proteome arrays consisting of thousands of recombinant proteins 29303132 high-density protein microarrays are a data-driven approach that enables the identification of new autoantibodies that are specific for a variety of diseases 733 hudson et al used a protein microarray containing 5005 human proteins to identify autoantibody sets capable of recognizing 94 antigens in the sera of patients with ovarian cancer 30 four of these antigens were further confirmed with immunoblot and tissue microarray analyses the researchers found that lamin ac structure-specific recognition protein 1 ssrp1 and ral-binding protein 1 were produced in larger quantities in cancer tissue than in control tissues furthermore the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the combined use of lamin ac and ssrp1 performed better than tumor marker ca-125 alone in identifying ovarian cancerthe same approach was used to assess the immune response to pathogenic proteins zhu et al generated a coronavirus protein microarray containing 82 purified proteins from severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and 5 additional coronaviruses with the aim of monitoring the immune response of patients infected with sars approximately 400 serum samples from the canadian sars outbreak were screened these samples included those from confirmed sars coronavirus cases patients with respiratory illnesses and asymptomatic healthcare workers bioinformatics data analysis allowed classification of the sera with 91 accuracy 90 diagnostic sensitivity and 93 diagnostic specificity 34 this study demonstrated very well that protein microarrays can be used for large-scale identification of virus-specific antibodies in sera schmid et al generated a protein microarray consisting of 251 proteins 92 of the vaccinia virus proteome the screening of the sera obtained from vaccinated individuals n  20 and nonvaccinated individuals n  20 revealed that the primary antibody response to individual vaccinia proteins varied from individual to individual whereas the total number of proteins recognized by antibodies was only slightly altered after the second vaccination 35 these data sets proved that protein microarrays could measure humoral immune responses to vaccines and provide a straightforward approach to evaluating newly developed vaccinesnodular thyroid disease which affects 50 of individuals who are 50 years old is characterized by the presence of single or multiple nodules within the thyroid gland more than 90 of thyroid nodules are not harmful or cancerous but if thyroid cancer is diagnosed treatment should begin as soon as possible fine-needle biopsy is the standard diagnostic method but 30 of results generated with the biopsy approach are not satisfactory linkov et al used the bead-based xmap technology to identify plasma patterns of 19 cytokines chemokines and growth factors that correlate with benign and malignant thyroid conditions 44 univariate analysis revealed that 5 factors epithelial growth factor egf hepatocyte growth factor hgf il-5 il-8 and rantes regulated upon activation normally t-expressed and presumably secreted enabled individuals with thyroid disease to be distinguished from the control group further multivariate analysis revealed a panel of 4 parameters il-8 hgf monocyte-induced  interferon il-12p40 that can discriminate between benign and malignant disease states area under the roc curve 081 95 ci 065090 this result demonstrates that protein arrays that define panels of plasmaserum biomarkers are promising tools to support the diagnosis of nodular thyroid diseasesauer et al used protein arrays to profile fine-needle biopsies from breast cancer patients to identify a panel of biomarkers for specific subgroups of breast cancer patients 45 lysates prepared from large-core needle biopsies of invasive breast carcinomas were analyzed with bead-based immunoassays with the overall aim of evaluating the production of 54 preselected proteins the results revealed that the profiles of 5 proteins in the tumor fibroblast growth factor 2 fas fas ligand tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 and rantes differed considerably between the patient groups with and without axillary lymph node metastasis kim et al used a similar approach to distinguish breast cancer patients from healthy volunteers 46 thirty-five analytes were selected from 4500 previously screened plasma samples obtained from patients with various types of cancer three biomarkers egf soluble cd40 ligand proapo a1 were identified at increased concentrations in plasma samples from the breast cancer group six biomarkers that showed a decreased plasma concentration high molecular weight kininogen apo a1 soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 vcam-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 vitamin dbinding protein and vitronectin were also identified different algorithms were then used to generate diagnostic models which allowed breast cancer patients to be discriminated from the healthy controls with a high level of diagnostic accuracy 918 with random forest analysis 915 with support vector machine analysis and 876 with linear discriminant analysisthere is a huge demand for the identification of sepsis-specific biomarkers that can reflect the state and severity of this inflammatory disease bozza et al used miniaturized sandwich immunoassays to evaluate the predictive values of cytokine production patterns in a sepsis time course 47 they found that some cytokine concentrations increased as the severity of inflammation and organ dysfunction increased with regard to the severity of organ dysfunction the concentrations of 2 the 17 evaluated cytokines il-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp-1 measured on day 1 correlated significantly with the sequential organ failure assessment score increased plasma concentrations of il-6 il-8 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor within the first 24 h correlated with organ dysfunction which failed to recover on day 3 the concentrations of 6 cytokines il-1 il-4 il-6 il-8 mcp-1 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor allowed prediction of early mortalityto identify serum biomarkers of early and late inflammatory bowel disease ibd torrence et al used a mouse model mdr1a mice for ibd triggered by infection with helicobacter bilis 48 the multianalyte profiling data revealed an increase in 5 plasma proteins il-11 il-17 10-kda interferon inducible protein ip-10 lymphotactin mcp-1 and vcam-1 in early-stage ibd eleven proteins il-11 ip-10 haptoglobin matrix metalloproteinase 9 mip-1 fibrinogen iga mip-3 vcam-1 apo a1 and il-18 displayed higher concentrations in a late stage of the disease the concentrations of all these biomarkers except apo a1 correlated with the histopathologic scores appropriate antibiotic treatment improved the clinical signs of ibd and led to decreases in the mean plasma concentrations of many of the biomarkers such ibd animal models seem to be suitable for identifying noninvasive biomarkers for monitoring ibd progression while at the same time increasing our understanding of ibd pathogenesis which is a major prerequisite for the development of new therapies the observations from animal models need to be confirmed with human ibd plasma samples however before definite statements can be made on the suitability of such biomarkerstwenty to forty percent of all rheumatoid arthritis patients do not respond to treatment with tumor necrosis factor blocking agents such as etanercept these inappropriate treatments not only are costly but also have severe side effects in these patients 4950 therefore the identification of biomarkers that can predict a clinical response to an antitumor necrosis factor  treatment would be extremely useful panels of cytokine production in plasma may enable the discrimination of responders from nonresponders fabre et al profiled plasma cytokines in rheumatoid arthritis patients undergoing etanercept therapy 49 the evidence biochip array randox laboratories was used to measure 10 proinflammatory and 2 antiinflammatory cytokines in serum samples collected on days 0 and 90 the researchers found that high plasma concentrations of mcp-1 and egf were associated with a response to etanercept in addition the combination of c-reactive protein and egf proved to be a good way of predicting the effect of etanercept treatment at 3 months diagnostic sensitivity 875 diagnostic specificity 75allen et al observed that the plasma concentrations of nuclear factor bmodulated cytokines and growth factors il-6 il-8 growth-regulated oncogene 1 vascular endothelial growth factor and hgf changed in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who had been treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy plasma parameters were quantitatively analyzed in samples from patients with a diagnosis of stage iiiiv oropharyngeal carcinoma to discover whether the plasma parameters of these proteins correlated with treatment response relapse or survival 51 the patients were treated with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy and the relationship between cytokine plasma concentrations and the survival rate was investigated with cox proportional hazards models and kaplan-meier survival analysis the detailed analysis of the data revealed that the concentrations of these cytokines correlated with both the response to therapy and poorer cause-specific survival a history of nonsmoking and higher vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations also correlated with an increased survival rate this approach is envisioned to be extendable to other cancers with a poor predicted outcome because the monitoring of longitudinal changes in cytokine concentrations can complement the information provided by clinical monitoring and imaging approacheskinases are a very interesting group of molecular targets for cancer treatment because they are involved among other things in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation a systematic analysis of such signaling proteins in samples of individual tumors may reveal multiple causative players during cancer progression 145253 laser capture microdissection can be used to resolve the problem of tissue heterogeneity by enabling the isolation of pure tumor cells from tissue sections 14 wulfkuhle et al used rppms in combination with laser capture microdissection technology to carry out a systematic analysis of cellular signaling in breast cancer tissue and metastatic lesions 20 twenty-five surgical samples of human breast cancers were screened for the presence of 90 signaling molecules it was possible to define subgroups of samples of primary breast tumors and metastatic lesions by their protein production or degree of phosphorylation on the basis of the pathway-specific signaling profiles such as egfr family signaling aktmtor pathway activation c-kitabl growth factor signaling or erk pathway activation the authors proposed that the detailed characterization of signaling activity has a huge potential with respect to the design of patient-tailored therapeutic regimens with a similar approach sheehan et al profiled the signaling activities of epithelial and stromal compartments of colon carcinomas the authors inferred from the production patterns of 60 signaling molecules that a coordinated cross talk exists between epithelium and stroma in cancer suggesting an epithelialmesenchymal transition such cross talk could produce a therapy-resistant tumor epithelium such protein microarraygenerated findings could have therapeutic implications for the treatment of colon cancer 54systems biology is an interdisciplinary research area that focuses on the systematic study of complex interactions in biological systems and the development of mechanistic models for predicting the behavior of the dynamic system compared with reductionist approaches which study smaller spatial scales or organizational units to understand the nature of complex systems the systems biologydriven approach is based on the integration of large genomic and proteomic data sets in combination with a broad biological knowledge and computational techniques the large number of parameters variables and constraints in cellular networks requires the use of numerical and computational techniques the efforts made in systems biology approaches are aimed at gaining detailed insights into all factors in a living cell and the changes that occur during disease progression 55 protein microarrays have proved to be one of the large-scale measurement methods capable of delivering experimental data sets in the quantities required for computational approaches 56 knickerbocker et al analyzed early mortality in patients undergoing kidney dialysis the researchers applied protein microarrays to quantify sets of plasma parameters in patient samples and combined these data sets with such clinical variables as body mass index diastolic blood pressure underlying disease and method of vascular access 57 the authors were able to predict early mortality in patients undergoing kidney dialysis when the molecular markers were combined with the clinical variables a systems biologybased analysis of this kind enables an individualized prognosis and supports clinicians in the choice of treatment regimens best suited for an individual patientwithin the last decade proteomics technologies have led to the identification of a huge number of biomarker candidates however the current limitation is the validation of biomarker candidates only a few of which have been successfully validated these markers include -fetoprotein carcinoembryonic antigen and prostate-specific antigen 5859 numerous aspects of the validation process need to be improved the current high-output technologies used for the discovery of biomarkers are low-throughput methods 6061 therefore novel technologies with a higher throughput and a higher analytical sensitivity are required such technologies must also take into account the fact that only small quantities of sample are typically available particularly in the case of clinical samples 61 protein microarrays have proved to be an excellent approach for biomarker-validation studies over the last few years different automation concepts have been developed for protein arrays one of the most advanced formats is the bead-based systems for which different companies have developed automated systems 62 in addition planar protein microarrays have been adapted to the 96-well microtiter plate format which allows microarrays to be processed with standard pipetting robots or multichannel pipettes 225763 several diagnostics companies have developed other protein technology platforms such as the randox evidence biochip system and the impact professional diagnostics platform roche diagnostics 64the major challenge in biomarker validation is the availability of high-quality capture molecules eg antibodies 22 despite tremendous efforts in the development of new methods to produce high-quality capture molecules such as aptamers or recombinant antibodies 366566 their potential value in biomarker validation still needs to be demonstratedprotein microarrays are excellently suited for diagnostic purposes 1267 several diagnostic protein microarray products have been cleared by the us food and drug administration fda or ce-marked for use in the eu 9 the

growth factors cell adhesion molecules thyroid function or drug abuse the companys drug abuse panel has received fda clearance the other assays are currently being evaluated by the fda 68it can be envisaged that a growing number of biomarkers will be defined and applied to diagnostic tests in the future this goal requires that appropriate quality controls be put in place and that the release of nonrequested test data and the handling of the diagnostic results be implemented and regulated 6970 these biomarker patterns will provide more individualized information which will then provide support to clinicians in the diagnosis and selection of optimal therapiesmultiplex protein assays will become more widely accepted and implemented in different diagnostic areas further advances in protein microarray technology will enable clinicians to use just 1 drop of blood to screen patients for relevant pathologic information in the doctors office before a particular drug is prescribed the fdas critical path initiative and the innovative medicines initiative a partnership between the european community and the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations are strategies for supporting the development of biomarker assays both for traditional diagnostic purposes and to support the drug-development process 7172these publicly supported efforts have been set up to back the collaboration between companies policy makers research institutes and hospitals such activities have the potential to accelerate the development of protein microarrays for diagnostic

coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 has emerged as a rapidly spreading communicable disease affecting practically all countries across the globe the overall death rate of covid-19 is rather low at ca 1423 12 depending on the normalisation and estimations of non-symptomatic patients however several risk groups have been identified as being at higher risk of developing a more severe form of the disease and subsequently have higher mortality in particular cardiovascular diseases hypertension chronic respiratory diseases metabolic syndrome ms and diabetes mellitus dm appear to play an important role in developing a more severe form of the disease with several complications 3 4 5 6 7 8 the prevalence of particular diseases and their impact on the death rate remains to be elucidated because the pre-existing diseases are not isolated adequately and may appear simultaneously dm for example is very often related to cardiovascular disorders and hypertension 3 accompanied by obesity 9 and in several cases also with smoking 6clear evidence has been provided that dm is one of the leading risk factors for covid-19 4 5 6 7 8 a more comprehensive review of the growing body of references reporting more severe disease and higher mortality rate of patients with dm is provided in the supplement see table s1 the international diabetes federation idf according to the who declaration has also published a special note on the risk of individuals with dm 10 it should be noted that despite the covid-19 epidemic at the same time we are facing the epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm according to the who global report on diabetes 11 an estimated 422 million adults worldwide were living with dm in 2014 compared to 108 million in 1980 the idf estimates that in 2019 ca 463 million adults 2079 years were living with dm and by 2045 this will rise to approx 700 million 12 thus the global increase in dm should be considered as a public health crisis that needs to be considered simultaneously in providing prevention services and treatment tools for covid-19besides the clinical evidence that dm is an important risk factor for covid-19 we are still lacking research analyses that would give us better understanding of the physiological processes involved in the interrelation between dm and covid-19 we analysed recent publications focused on covid-19 and dm and make parallels with previous studies analysing the interrelations between dm and the severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus sars-cov infection this is promising because of similarities between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the genetic sequence of sars-cov-2 shares more than 80 of the identity of sars-cov 3 and both viruses use the same receptor the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as the cellular entry point 313 14 15 we have applied data mining analysis of publications in pubmed to investigate the common physiological links between dm sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the results revealed three main pathophysiological pathways linking dm and covid-19 via ace2 liver dysfunction and chronic inflammation accordingly the clinical biomarkers are proposed for predicting better an adverse outcome of covid-19 which might help clinicians for taking appropriate measures we discuss the importance of these findings for patients with dm and those with dysregulated biomarkers due to their metabolic disorders and prediabetic state but not yet being diagnosed for dmwe have developed a python-based framework for publication mining and knowledge graph extraction publication mining on pubmed was performed using the python library entrez 16 we searched pubmed for selected queries which are related to covid-19 and dm overall we acquired 1121078 publications in the time span between 01 and 01-2000 and 17-4-2020 from those publications we extracted query-specific knowledge graphs the latter are graph-based abstractions of a specific knowledge embedded in the medium from which we extracted them 17 we have identified 14 topics which are important either from the perspective of dm or covid-19 these topics are the nodes of the graphs and by applying text mining techniques on the acquired publications we can show which topics are related and how strong their interrelations are lastly we merged the separated knowledge graphs into one single knowledge graph highlighting maximal topic-pair occurrence frequencies when viewed from a different research perspective a detailed description of the method topics and queries is provided in the supplementin the studies investigating cellular and molecular mechanisms that could be responsible for an increased risk of individuals with dm for covid-19 ace2 has appeared as one of the crucial ones 1718 initially ace2 has been identified from human heart failure and lymphoma cdna libraries 1920 and was later shown to serve as the receptor for the sars-cov 21 22 23 24 recently it has been shown that ace2 is also the cellular entry point for the virus sars-cov-2 314 and sars-cov-2 has an even higher affinity than sars-cov for ace2 13 the expression and distribution of the ace2 in the human body may indicate the potential routes of the infection and the organs most targeted by sars-cov-2 ace2 is expressed differently in tissue and organs high ace2 expression was identified in the alveolar cells of the lung oesophagus epithelial cells absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon cholangiocytes myocardial cells kidney proximal tubule cells bladder urothelial cells and epithelial cells of the oral mucosa 14 the high ace2 expression in lungs and kidneys corresponds with the most common acute conditions acute respiratory distress ard and acute renal failure arf in one of the largest studies analysing characteristics of 14860 covid-19 patients dying in italy ard was observed in most of the patients 965 followed by arf 243 25the expression and distribution of ace2 changes with age and is influenced by several diseases in particular in providing a healthy metabolism ace2 should be fine regulated like a label not too little not too much just right 1 in patients with dm the expression of ace2 depends on the progression of the disease in an early phase of dm the ace2 is upregulated 2627 this increased expression of ace2 is likely to be an adaptive response to counter the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace overactivity and the ace2 could truly be seen as good ace 26 several studies have shown that the ace2ang-17mas axis plays an important anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic role for review see refs 28 in later phases of dm the ace2 is downregulated 27 one of the reasons that ace2 expression is reduced in patients with dm could be glycosylation 1 the deficiency of ace2 in the progression of dm causes complications eg diabetic nephropathy 1272930 and may also contribute to enhanced oxidative stress in the pancreas and to decreased glucose tolerance and impaired insulin secretion 2631 therefore the upregulation of ace2 is promising to restore the positive effects of ace2 experimental evidence exists that an increase in ace2 expression can indeed improve pancreatic beta-cell function in dbdb mice 32 to this end several drugs in particular ace inhibitors acei and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs have been developed with the end effect of increasing the ace2in the context of metabolic syndrome and dm the ace2 regulation appears as a double-edged sword 1 on the one hand the ace2ang-17 system plays an important anti-inflammatory and antioxidant role protecting the lungs against acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and ace2 has been shown to be protective against lethal avian influenza a h5n1 infection and others 3334 on the other hand however the expression of ace2 is markedly increased in patients with dm and hypertension being treated with acei or arbs as an adaptive response to counteract the elevated levels of ang-ii and ang-i 1 thus the implementation of ace2-stimulating drugs could facilitate the entry of sars-cov- 2 into pneumocytes and other ace2-rich tissues and consequently it might result in more severe and fatal disease as hypothesised by some researchers 1735 at present this is rather speculative and the question remains open for further studies to clarify this issueto investigate a broader context and get a deeper insight into the interrelation between dm and covid-19 via ace2 we applied data mining analysis of publications in pubmed the analysis is focused on topics which have been found to play a key role in the development and outcome of covid-19 disease the task of our data mining algorithm was to extract the main topics in the acquired publications by counting the pubmed entries with a particular topic and calculating the frequency of co-appearances of topic pairs in the database a detailed description of the data mining procedure and the corresponding analysis are given in the supplement regarding the topic ace2 we have analysed publications separately for the period before 2020 and separately for the year 2020 the results for the period before 2020 are shown in fig 1
a and b the fraction of articles containing a particular topic in the ace2 database is presented in fig 1a fig 1b shows the corresponding interrelation between the extracted topics in the form of a weighted knowledge graph the results of the data mining analysis for 2020 are presented in fig 1c and d in analogy with fig 1a and b fig 1c and d shows the fraction of articles containing a particular topic in the ace2 publication database and the weighted knowledge graph visualises the interrelation between the extracted topics respectivelyin both fig 1b and d the triangle dm-ace2-covid-19 can be well recognised highlighting the interrelation between dm and covid-19 via ace2 ace2 axis importantly our analysis shows that only a weak direct link exists between dm and covid-19 which obscures the actual interrelation between the two diseases therefore data mining can contribute importantly to a deeper insight into the interrelation between the topics they might not always be strongly connected with a direct link but via other neighbouring topics that might not be otherwise recognised as trivial inter-hops our results show that in the context of the interrelated topics in pubmed the ace2 appears as an important link between the topic diabetes and the topic sars in both casesas expected because of the recent epidemic the link between ace2 and sars is much stronger in 2020 compare fig 1b and d and sars has replaced the leading topic hypertension before 2020 the topic hypertension remains among the most related topics with ace2 also in 2020 and plays a crucial role in influencing the triangle dm  ace2  covid-19 this result agrees with the fact that hypertension is the leading comorbidity in covid-19 25 it is a blurred line between hypertension and dm because of the fact that ca 70 of patients with dm have hypertension 3 so hypertension together with dm can be seen as the leading risk factor for complications and fatal outcomes of covid-19 3 4 57artificial intelligence ai analysis 36 revealed that a mildly elevated liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase alt is the most predictive clinical biomarker in newly infected patients with sars-cov-2 for later development of ards the ai model that learned from historical data of patients from two hospitals in wenzhou zhejiang china achieved 7080 accuracy in predicting severe cases of covid-19 36 several other research groups have also found a relationship between covid-19 and liver injury in particular abnormal levels of alt and aspartate aminotransferase ast for review see ref 5 the common observation is that abnormal liver aminotransferase levels are more prevalent in severe cases than in mild cases of covid-19 it appears that a major disease burden might be chronic liver diseases including chronic viral hepatitis non-alcoholic fatty liver disease nafld and other metabolic disorders including ms and dm 537from the physiological point of view it is of interest to understand why these chronic liver disorders and in particular the elevated alt levels are so tightly related to covid-19 it should be noted that liver disorders are in very close relation with ms prediabetes and dm and there is a huge body of evidence supporting this close interrelationship similar to the recent finding of ai 36 that alt is a promising predictor for the severity of covid-19 sattar et al 38 have reported that alt was recognised as a reliable predictor of dm in this clinical study by sattar et al 38 the participants that have developed dm over 5 years of follow-up the alt but not ast levels increased progressively with the increasing number of ms abnormalities and those with alt in the top quartile had an elevated risk for dm versus those in the bottom quartile several other studies have also found this high correlation between elevated alt concentrations and the dm ms and nafld 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 interestingly elevations of alt must not be very high already mild but chronic elevations of transaminases often reflect underlying insulin resistance and dm 45taken together if a chronic liver disease mostly characterised by elevated alt is one of the major concerns for dm and the same is true for covid-19 then covid-19 and dm have a common enemy to understand the physiological role of this common enemy we have applied data mining analysis of publications in pubmed on a broader query list dm covid-19 ace2 inflammation alt and liver  liver disease for details see the supplement the results are shown in fig 2
 the network presentation shows the main nodes and their connections the link between sars and alt via the topic liver  liver disease is the most evident one and hence fully in agreement with the predictions of the ai investigations by jiang et al 36 it should be noted however that our analysis carries different information than that of jiang et al 36 but the results are complementary pointing out the important role of alt in covid-19 according to our analysis this link between alt and covid-19 is not a direct link and therefore intuitively not recognised so easily the nodes alt and sars are connected through the hub liver  liver disease that is also connected with dm and provides the connection between dm-alt-sars see fig 2 we call this connection liver axis linking dm and covid-19 via alt representing a reliable biomarker for liver dysfunctions involved in dm and covid-19the results presented in fig 2 demonstrate a comprehensive view of the relationships between the diseases their pathophysiological pathways and the corresponding biomarkers the basic two diseases considered here are covid-19 and dm we start with the corresponding nodes in the network ie sars and diabetes and highlight them by colouring the corresponding nodes red the link between sars and diabetes is rather weak which means that the two diseases are not very often related in the literature however there exist three very important indirect links between sars and diabetes provided via the three most connected first neighbours of both sars and diabetes ie ace2 liver  liver disease and inflammation marked blue in fig 2 among these first most connected common neighbours we can find the just introduced liver axis and the previously discussed ace2 axis both axes have their clinical biomarkers and to reveal them we look at the next most connected neighbours marked green in the network fig 2 in the liver axis the most connected node among the next neighbours of liver  liver disease is alt indicating that alt is an important clinical biomarker for covid-19 which also corresponds with the previously discussed predictions of the ai investigations by jiang et al 36 in the ace2 axes the next most connected neighbour of ace2 is the node hypertension and hypertension is indeed the most important clinical biomarker indicating the highest risk for covid-19 as discussed in the previous section 25in addition to the liver axis discussed in this section and the ace2 axis discussed in the previous section our analysis also points to the third very important link between dm and covid-19 ie inflammation notably this is not an acute inflammatory state being coevolved with covid-19 but it corresponds to a pre-existing chronic low-grade inflammation the revealed 3rd axis interconnecting dm and covid-19 ie inflammatory axis deserves a separate presentation and is discussed in the next sectioninflammation represents an important link between dm and covid-19 fig 2 reveals that inflammation is one of the most connected first common neighbours of both sars and diabetes marked in blue in fig 2 looking at the next most connected neighbours of the inflammation node marked in green in fig 2 we can recognise three important biomarkers ie fibrosis interleukin-6 il-6 and lymphocytes the serum biomarkers il-6 and the count of lymphocyte are determined routinely and in patients with covid-19 these biomarkers were shown to be considerably dysregulated 418 for example in a group of non-survivors the serum values of il-6 were much higher 25-times in comparison with the values measured in survivors and the lymphocyte count was considerably lower 25-times in the group of non-survivors 4to understand the physiological and clinical background of this inflammatory axis linking dm and covid-19 better we provide a short review of publications a large body of references exists linking dm with chronic inflammation for a recent review see ref 46 and on the other hand several reports for covid-19 show a clear correlation between the severity of the disease and the level of dysregulated biomarkers for systemic inflammation 41847 since the outbreak of covid-19 there has simply not been enough time for extensive research that could explain comprehensively all the physiological mechanisms linking covid-19 with chronic inflammation however indirect evidence exists that might help in understanding the link between dm and covid-19 via chronic inflammation the fact is that both t2dm and the severity of covid-19 are more prevalent in the elderly population the interrelation between ageing and inflammatory processes has been well established and we know that inflammation is an important concomitant cause of many major age-associated pathologies such as cancer neurodegeneration and dm 4849 during the process of ageing the immune system becomes compromised and is associated with an increasing inflammation 50 in particular chronic inflammation the so-called inflammaging and metabolic function are affected strongly by the ageing processes 495152although chronic inflammation is a coevolving process with ageing and in elderly groups associated with several pathologies it is not trivial to understand why and to what extent the inflammatory processes are involved in other diseases and how they influence comorbidity in particular the comorbidity is difficult to assess when attributed to the disease connections on the molecular level such as dysregulated genes proteinprotein interactions and metabolic pathways as potential causes of comorbidity 49 from the perspective of genetics for example a pair of diseases can be connected if they are both associated with the same genes being dysregulated 495354 we are still lacking data for sars-cov-2 however for the previous sars-cov infection it has been shown that the nfkbia gene plays the most important role for comorbidities of this disease 49 remarkably in age-related inflammatory processes leading to chronic inflammatory diseases cids the first genes being dysregulated are nfkbia and akt1 49 thus the link between cids and sars-cov infection can be established at the very early stages of the development of cids the number of shared dysregulated genes between sars-cov infection and cid should be analysed to assess the comorbidity risk of a given cid in a more progressive stage importantly it has been found that t2dm shares the highest number of dysregulated genes with sars-cov infection 49 this gives a solid base for the comorbidity of t2dm for sars-cov infection via inflammation that can at least from the genetical and epigenetical point of view be explained by the same gene dysregulations starting with dysregulations of nfkbia and akt1these results from genetic studies agree with findings indicating that pi3k-akt activation is induced by insulin 55 and any defect in the pi3k-akt signalling pathway is associated with insulin resistance and dm 56 moreover it has been found that not only dm but also obesity is related to imbalances in the pi3k-akt signalling pathway 57 this causes additional concern as in several countries obesity is reaching the characteristics of an epidemic that spread out quickly and even more aggressively than dm therefore we should be concerned about a broad range of metabolic disorders that lead to chronic inflammatory states and in most cases do not evoke enough attention because of their silent ie low-grade appearance in the present covid-19 epidemic all these chronic inflammatory states closely related to metabolic disorders even though not yet treated as dm or any other cids deserve special attention and should be considered seriously as an important risk factor for the severity and mortality of patients infected with sars-cov-2this study has some limitations the number of published articles that have been analysed for this year is relatively small and some interrelations could strengthen in the future in addition it would be beneficial to add other data repositories in the analysis including proteinprotein interaction networks in combination with drug information resources for approved drugs by knowing the therapeutic targets drug metabolism and other molecular interaction network information the knowledge graph could be enriched and expanded to highlight even more complex relationshipsthe motivation for this study comes from the clinical evidence indicating dm as an important risk factor for covid-19 a large body of clinical reports confirms an adverse development and higher mortality of patients with dm see supplement table s1 our analyses based on data mining of publications in pubmed reveal that dm and covid-19 are interrelated via three main axes the ace2 axis liver axis and inflammatory axis all these axes are further interrelated in particular the liver axis and the inflammatory axis with common biomarkers and form a complex network fig 2 we have extracted the most important clinical biomarkers linking dm and covid-19 the hypertension elevated values of alt and il-6 and a decreased count of lymphocytes which is in good agreement with the results of other studies reporting the indicators for higher risk of covid-19 41825we found it rather surprising that dm and covid-19 and even more generally dm and infections with sars-cov and sars-cov-2 do not coappear more frequently in publications the data mining analysis showed that the link between these two topics diabetes and sars is rather weak fig 2 the whole research todate was obviously concentrated on the nearest neighbours of dm and sars separately our analysis revealed the common nearest neighbours of both dm and sars and shows how data mining and network analysis can contribute to better and deeper insight into the interrelation between the diseases moreover we were able to identify the outer neighbours in our case the important biomarkers and when these biomarkers correspond with the clinical data indicating that they are indeed closely related with the diseases as in our case the blood pressure alt il-6 lymphocytes count for example these sophisticated numerical approaches are justifiedthe proposed biomarkers can be applied directly in clinical practice it is recommended that the medical history of newly infected patients with sars-cov-2 should be checked for evidence of pre-existing long-term chronic dysregulations of these biomarkers in general patients with dm and elderly people are at higher risk however not all of them have these dysregulations whereas on the other hand in a world full of stress less time for preparing good food and less physical activity younger populations and people not even being diagnosed for dm can have considerable dysregulations of these biomarkers putting them at higher risk for covid-19 therefore these findings may help in preventing masses of people being unaware of their metabolic disorders and prediabetic state it is true that at present the main concern is covid-19 as the most rapidly spreading epidemic with a readily recognised severe outcome and with a concern of crashing complete national health systems also in developed countries however we should not forget that some of the most persistent silently spreading epidemics with a huge and permanently increasing annual rate of morbidity remain obesity metabolic syndrome and dm it is hard to imagine but for sure we would be less concerned about the covid-19-epidemic if we did not live in the middle of a

after covid-19 outbreaks the risk of thrombosis and bleeding has attracted much attentionit has been reported that abnormal d-dimer levels are associated with poor prognosisd-dimer levels were higher in covid-19 patients and were related with markers of inflammation and after treatments d-dimer levels decreased which was synchronous with hscrp levels in patients with good clinical prognosis also the low correlation between padua vte score and d-dimer levels weakened the role of d-dimer in the prediction of thrombosisthe abnormal changes of d-dimer and inflammatory factors suggest that aggressive anticoagulant therapy might be needed
since december 2019 a novel member of human coronavirus which newly identified in wuhan china is officially named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv 13 sars-cov-2 which belongs to the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage in the phylogenetic tree is a new strain of rna viruses that has not been previously identified in humans 4 recently the disease caused by sars-cov-2 was named as covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 by world health organization who the numbers of infected patients worldwide increase rapidly and has exceeded 100000in previous reports 13 the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients have been investigated specifically covid-19 is usually characterized by lower respiratory tract symptoms with fever dry cough and dyspnea a manifestation similar to those of two other diseases caused by coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 5 6 the reported overall case-fatality rate cfr for covid-19 by now was 23 but cases in those aged 70 to 79 years had an 80 cfr and cases in those aged 80 years and older had a 148 cfr 7 in some patients severe pulmonary and extra-pulmonary complications may lead to respiratory failure and life-threatening events it has been reported that about 50 of the patients had increased d-dimer levels and abnormal d-dimer levels are associated with poor prognosis 8 9 thus in some stable patients with sudden death acute organ and embolism and infarction should take into consideration although the incidence of thrombosis in patients with covid-19 has not been determined the incidence of deep vein thrombosis dvt and pulmonary embolism pe was 205 and 114 respectively in sars cases 10 in addition thromboembolisms formation was seen in pathologic studies based on autopsies or biopsies which greatly resemble those seen in sars and mers coronavirus infection 11 12however conventional anticoagulation may need to be considered carefully as there is an increased risk of bleeding in patients with covid-19 13 therefore in our experience biomarkers which can identify thrombus formation at earlier stages might be used to evaluate the formation of thrombus and response to treatment d-dimers are fibrin degradation products which have been shown to be useful in a clinical decision rule for ruling out pulmonary embolism 14 highlighting its role as a potentially helpful biomarker however the relationship between d-dimer and covid-19 and the level changes during disease development were not fully reported in this study we compared the d-dimer levels of covid-19 patients with that of bacterial pneumonia assessed the use of consecutive d-dimer levels after admission to hospital and explored its association with markers of inflammationthis was a retrospective study done at two centres in china the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the declaration of helsinki and approved by the medical ethics committee of the second xiangya hospital of central south university the requirement for informed patient consent was waived by the ethics committee for this retrospective study that evaluated de-identified data involving no potential risk to patients and no link between the patients and the researchers patients with confirmed covid-19 pneumonia who were admitted to tongji hospital of tongji medical college and patients with confirmed community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in the second xiangya hospital of central south university were retrospectively enrolled tongji hospital is one of the designated hospitals for the hospitalization of patients with covid-19 and one of its hospital wards has been entrusted by the second xiangya hospital of central south university since february 202076 patients with confirmed covid-19 pneumonia enrolled in our department were screened 57 severe cases were included in our study admission date from february 9 to february 15 2020 patients with secondary infection including bacteria and fungus or patients lack of results of pre-treatment laboratory examination were excluded the diagnosis of covid-19 was determined with at least two positive results of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay for sars-cov-2 patients absent of or with negative sars-cov-2 test results were also excluded from this study the covid-19 pneumonia has been classified to four types clinically by guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 infection by the national health commission 15 the classification of the four clinical types is as follow 1 mild symptoms very mild no pneumonia manifestation in ct 2 ordinary fever respiratory tract symptoms and pneumonia manifestation in ct scan 3 severe respiratory distress respiratory rate  30min oxygen saturation  93 at rest and pao2fio2  300 mmhg 4 critical respiratory failure need mechanic ventilation shock and combined multi-organs failure all patients were clinically classified as severe at the time of admission 46 patients with laboratory-identified bacterial pneumonia by pathogenic detection were collected between august 1 2019 and march 1 2020 the padua prediction score is a risk assessment model used to identify medical patients at high risk for venous thromboembolism vte demographic information clinical characteristics including medical history exposure history comorbidities signs and symptoms chest computed tomographic ct scan or x-ray results and laboratory findings of each patient were obtained from the electronic medical record system of these two centres and analyzed by three independent researchersall medical laboratory data including the numbers of leukocytes lymphocytes and eosinophils percentages of lymphocyte and eosinophils concentrations of d-dimer high-sensitivity c-reactive protein hscrp procalcitonin pct and serum creatine kinase were generated by the clinical laboratory of tongji hospital and the second xiangya hospital the samples for laboratory tests were collected on admission and during the hospital stay peripheral venous blood was collected for routine blood test using automatic hematology analyzer the biochemical parameters such as liver and renal function were measured by roche automated clinical chemistry analyzer roche diagnostics mannheim germany serum pct was measured by the luminescence immunoassay and hscrp was measured with a latex particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay roche diagnostics it is worth mentioning that coagulation tests were detected using a sta-r max coagulation analyzer and original reagents diagnostica stago saint-denis france in both hospitals the laboratory data for some patients were missing due to the absence of types of tests or delayed resultscontinuous measurements were expressed as mean  sd if they are normally distributed or median iqr if they are not and their differences were compared by the students t-test or mannwhitney u-test or kruskalwallis test or wilcoxon signed rank test besides categorical variables were expressed as count  and compared by 2 test or fishers exact test the relationship among biomarkers were assessed using spearmans correlations analysis we used spss version 250 and graph pad prism version 70 for all analyses two-tailed p values  005 were considered statistically significantthe study population included 57 hospitalized patients with covid-19 and 46 hospitalized patients with community acquired pneumonia cap for covid-19 patients the median age was 65 years iqr 5472 and 44 were men for cap patients the median age was 64 years iqr 6070 and 59 were men table 1 both of the covid-19 patients and cap patients had 1 or more coexisting medical conditions and compared with covid-19 patients cap patients were more likely to have coexisting medical conditions including cardiovascular disease covid-19 patients vs cap patients 4 7 vs 10 22 pulmonary disease 1 2 vs 16 35 and smoking 1 2 vs 22 48 table 1on admission no matter in covid-19 patients or cap patients most patients had fever cough shortness of breath myalgia chest distress diarrhea inappetence and fatigue besides there were numerous differences in laboratory findings table 2 compared with covid-19 patients cap patients were more likely to have higher white blood cell wbc and neutrophil counts n as well as higher procalcitonin pct erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and fibrinogen fib conversely lower activated partial thromboplastin time aptt and there were no significant differences in other biomarkers levels between two groupsto investigate whether d-dimer levels is associated with levels of inflammatory factors we performed spearmans correlations analysis between d-dimer levels and infection-related biomarkers levels in covid-19 patients and cap patients as shown in table 3 for covid-19 patients d-dimer levels were positively correlated with infection-related biomarkers levels including hscrp pct and esr before treatments r  0426 0349 0345 respectively p  005 and d-dimer levels also had great correlations with inflammatory cells levels before treatments such as wbc n l r  0402 0464  0426 respectively p  001 and coagulation function-related factors levels such as pt inr r  0368 0386 respectively p  001 in addition for cap patients there were also positive correlations between d-dimer levels and infection-related biomarkers levels before treatments including hscrp pct r  0300 0391 respectively p  005 table 4 and d-dimer levels were also related with other biomarkers levels before treatments like pt aptt inr and ck r  0374 0383 0398  0464 respectively p  005 table 4 at the same time we also analyzed the correlations between these indicators after treatments in covid-19 patients and found that there were still great correlations between d-dimer and the same biomarkers as above their correlation coefficients r  03 p  005 however due to the absence of following-up data we couldnt analyze these relationships between post-treatment biomarkers levels in cap patientsmore importantly we found that in covid-19 patients the correlation between d-dimer levels and hscrp levels before treatments was related to the levels of hscrp while the levels of hscrp exceed 10 mgl the correlation between d-dimer and hscrp was stronger hscrp  10 mgl vs hscrp  10 mgl r    0212 vs 0448 table 5to explore the difference of d-dimer levels between covid-19 patients and cap patients we divided the levels of untreated hscrp into two groups both in covid-19 patients and cap patients one group for hscrp levels  30 mgl and another group for hscrp  30 mgl according to the median hscrp level in 103 patients we found that no matter in covid-19 patients or cap patients the higher hscrp levels the higher d-dimer levels figs 1a 2a besides this trend also existed in other biomarkers levels including pct fib and inr figs 1bf 2bf as shown in table 2 hscrp levels were 156 38400 mgl in covid-19 patients and 828 1231278 mgl in cap patients thus we also grouped covid-19 patients or cap patients at their median level of hscrp respectively and found that all the trends remained unchanged figs s2 s3interestingly it was worth mentioning that compared with covid-19 patients the levels of hscrp were higher in cap patients whereas the levels of d-dimer were lower in cap patients fig 3a bas previous described d-dimer levels were truly related with biomarkers of inflammation especially with hscrp we then analyzed the specific relationship between d-dimer levels and hscrp levels in covid-19 patients and found that both hscrp levels and d-dimer levels decreased after treatments fig 4a b moreover we analyzed their relationship before and after treatments stratified by untreated hscrp quartiles as expected after therapy hscrp levels were significantly decreased in the 2nd 3rd and 4th quartiles of untreated hscrp fig s1ad and there were also a downward trend in d-dimer levels at different quartiles fig s1ehhowever considering that the values stratified by untreated hscrp quartiles might be higher or lower cutoff values which could bias the results and as previously described hscrp levels were significantly decreased in the 2nd quartile we then divided all patients into two groups based on the cutoff value 10 mgl of untreated hscrp levels hscrp  10 mgl  10 mgl obviously after treatments the decrease of d-dimer levels was synchronous with the decrease of hscrp levels fig 4cfin addition its worth mentioning that there were 53 patients were cured or turned into mild cases whereas 4 patients were died in our study more important we found that in deceased patients both the untreated hscrp or d-dimer levels and treated hscrp or d-dimer levels were still abnormally high table s1 conversely both hscrp and d-dimer levels significantly decreased in patients with a good clinical prognosis after therapyas we know d-dimer is one of the markers for thrombosis however the synchronous decline of d-dimer and hscrp suggests that the elevated d-dimer levels in covid-19 patients is related to inflammation which limits its role in the prediction of thrombosis further analysis showing low correlation between padua vte score and d-dimer levels spearmans r  0264 p  005 weakened the role of d-dimer in the prediction of thrombosis subsequently in order to investigate whether the levels of d-dimer also decreased significantly in those patients with a significant decrease in hscrp levels we then analyzed the relationship between the extent of decline in hscrp and d-dimer levels after treatments interestingly it was worth mentioning that some patients had a significant decrease in hscrp levels whereas their d-dimer levels were increased fig 5 highlighting the possibility for aggressive coagulation therapy therefore for these patients the anticoagulant therapy was strengthened and the low molecular weight heparin was changed from the preventive dose to the therapeutic dosein this analysis of our enrolled patients with covid-19 and bacterial pneumonia we demonstrated that covid-19 patients with significantly higher d-dimer levels which highlighting the possibility of more obvious activation of the coagulation system although d-dimer levels correlated with inflammatory markers and tended to normalize in convalescent stage in most of the patients the anomalous rise might be an indicator of active anticoagulant therapy although it has been reported that d-dimer is significantly increased in patients with covid-19 and is related to prognosis 16 17 this is the first report about the relationship between d-dimer levels and the markers of inflammation in covid-19 as well as the variation during disease progressionelevated d-dimer levels have been reported in a limited number of studies involved in both sars and cap patients 1821 as demonstrated in our study similar to sars and cap patients the d-dimer levels of covid-19 patients was also elevated the reasons responsible for the elevated d-dimer levels are only partially explained it is well known that d-dimer are produced during fibrin breakdown and serve as a marker of fibrinolytic activity a relationship between proinflammatory cytokines and markers of activation of the coagulation cascade including d-dimer has been demonstrated in critical patients or patients with sepsis 22 23 there is also evidence that under inflammatory conditions the alveolar haemostatic balance is shifted towards a predominance of prothrombotic activity 24 in addition pro-inflammatory cytokines may be involved in endothelial injury and may activate coagulation and inhibit fibrinolysis in patients with severe sepsis 25 in this paper the relationship between d-dimer levels and the markers of inflammation were also analysed in both covid and cap patients although we lost the post-treatment data for cap patients all the data reported in our analysis showed that d-dimer levels were significantly correlated with inflammation and tended to normalize as the inflammation subsided in most of the patients highlighting the point that inflammation is one of the causes of coagulation activation in patients with both covid and bacterial pneumoniahowever one problem that could not be ignored is that patients with covid-19 have higher levels of d-dimer when their crp levels are lower than that of cap patients this highly suggests that there are other factors besides inflammation that responsible for activation of the coagulation system in patients with covid-19 in a previous study 26 gralinski et al investigated viral pathogenesis and identify a novel host pathway involved in sars progression their data suggest that dysregulation of the urokinase pathway during sars-coronavirus infection contributes to more severe lung pathology and profound alterations in the systemic haemostatic balancein the treatment of patients with covid-19 the prevention and treatment of thrombus should be noted it has been reported that reactive thrombocytosis occurred in 4 of patients which may be related to the increased risk of thrombus 8 in addition considering that patients with covid-19 might have increased blood viscosity due to high fever and excessive sweating hypercoagulable state because of activation of coagulation system 9 together with the risk factors such as long-term bedridden obesity and old age the risk of thrombus is further increased the diagnostic value of d-dimer levels for thrombus formation in covid-19 patients is unclear whether higher d-dimer levels in patients with covid-19 suggest the need for more aggressive anticoagulant therapy deserves further discussion previous studies demonstrated high d-dimer levels in patients with cap similar to patients with pulmonary embolism that decreased the reliability of the test for the differential diagnosis of cap and pulmonary embolism 19 as shown in our study levels of d-dimer decreased with the disappearance of inflammation and the improvement of the disease which indicates that it is not reasonable to judge whether anticoagulation is needed only according to d-dimer levels also the low correlation between padua vte score and d-dimer levels weakened the role of d-dimer in the prediction of thrombosis this raises the question of what indicators are used to guide prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in patients with covid-19 interestingly not all patients d-dimer levels decreased with the decrease of inflammatory factors suggesting the possibility of thrombosis thus it should be noted that if levels of d-dimer are not synchronized with the regression of inflammation anticoagulation therapy is needed in addition vte risk assessment should also be considered in clinical decision-making because the mortality of covid-19 increases with age and elderly patients are more likely to have bleeding events bleeding scores should also be included in clinical decisionsthis study has some several limitations its a retrospective analysis and patients we included in the present analysis were not systematically assessed for the presence of pulmonary embolism and vte because of conditional restriction furthermore although the hscrp and d-dimer levels were examined by the same method the covid-19 patients and cap patients were enrolled in different centres which might reduce the credibility of research resultselevated baseline d-dimer levels are associated with inflammation in covid-19 patients and have limited predictive value for thrombosis in the treatment of covid-19 patients the change of d-dimer levels should be observed dynamically and the abnormal changes of d-dimer and inflammatory factors suggest that anticoagulant therapy might be needed also although the predictive value of vte score need to be further studied in covid-19 patients it might be useful than baseline d-dimer levels for prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in covid-19 patientssevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a highly contagious coronavirus that causes pneumonia-like deaths and spreads fast through human-to-human contact 13 since the first suspected cases were documented in early december 2019 the increasing number of sars-cov-2 cases has reached more than six millions including 350000 deaths worldwide by june 1th 2020it has been hypothesized that older people are more vulnerable to sars-cov-2 an early study reported a high prevalence of sars-cov-2 in older males with comorbidities 4 subsequent studies confirmed that sars-cov-2 was often observed in older patients with comorbidities 5 and severe disease progression 6 7 a study of 138 hospitalized patients reported a higher rate of icu admission in older patients compared with younger patients 8 another study revealed a high risk of mortality in older patients with comorbidities and acute respiratory distress syndrome 9 the overall case-fatality rate was 138 in china but this rate increased to 399 in older patients between 60 and 69 years 861 in older patients between 70 and 79 years and 134 in 80 patients 10 however few studies have revealed clinical differences between older and younger groupsour study aims to characterize the clinical features of sars-cov-2 in younger and older groups based on a large cohort of 239 patients in changsha - a neighboring city of wuhan moreover we assessed clinical symptoms laboratory findings comorbidities and hospitalization information to monitor the disease progression of sars-cov-2a total of 239 patients confirmed with sars-cov-2 infections were hospitalized in changsha table 1 summarizes their demographic and clinical characteristics the median age of 239 patients was 45 years interquartile range 34 to 59 years and 58 243 patients had at least 60 years of age figure 1a nearly half of the 239 patients were males the youngest patient was a one-year-old girl discharged on february 18 after a 15-day hospitalization while the eldest patient was an 84-year-old woman who had a 19-day hospitalization from february 6 to february 25 fifty-three 222 patients were categorized into the severe group and severe cases were often observed in the elderly patients figure 1bat hospital admission fever 674 was the most common symptom followed by cough 582 fatigue 339 dyspnea 126 sore throat 113 myalgia 96 diarrhea 84 and others table 1 in addition 72 301 patients had at least one comorbidity such as hypertension 134 diabetes 63 cardiovascular disease 42 hepatitis 29 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 21 cerebral infarction 21 peptic ulcer 17 cardiac arrhythmia 13 and abnormal lipid metabolism 13 furthermore the increased risk of comorbidities was associated with the patient age that elderly patients were more likely to develop comorbidities figure 1b hiv infection was absent in all patientsclinical features of 58 older patients and 181 younger patients were summarized in table 1 the median ages of older and younger patients were 66 and 40 years respectively p0001 the percentage of females was higher in the older group than the younger group 621 versus 470 p0045 compared with younger patients older patients had pronounced key features such as i older patients were more likely to be severe 379 versus 171 p0001 ii older patients harbored more comorbidities such as hypertension 362 versus 61 p0001 diabetes 155 versus 33 p0001 and cardiovascular disease 103 versus 22 p0007 and iii older patients had more cases of dyspnea 207 versus 99 p0032comparisons of ct diagnostics in younger and older patients revealed no difference in the risk of abnormal lungs p0972 two males were severely ill during hospitalization and died thereafter ct images showed the accumulation of ground-glass opacities and pulmonary consolidation during the disease progression figure 2we compared laboratory biomarkers in older and younger patients at baseline table 2 the baseline values of eosinophils c-reactive protein lactic acid were abnormal in older and younger groups while six biomarkers white blood cells neutrophils alanine aminotransferase total bilirubin creatinine lactic acids were similarly expressed in both groups table 2 of interest the decrease of lymphocytes figure 1c and the increase of c-reactive protein figure 1d were observed along with the increasing age when patients were categorized based on their ages in decades 1 to 19 20 to 29 30 to 39 40 to 49 50 to 59 60 to 69 70 yearscompared with younger patients older patients had many abnormal biomarkers at baseline including i higher levels of c-reactive protein 301 mgl versus 121 mgl p0001 ii high levels of aspartate aminotransferase 2790 ul versus 2338 ul p0001 and blood urea nitrogen 47 mmoll versus 41 mmoll p0003 iii lower levels of hemoglobin 123 gl versus 132 gl p0001 and albumin 3556 gl versus 3898 gl p0001 and iv lower levels of lymphocytes 098 versus 125 109 cellsl p0001 the percentage of patients with lymphocytopenia was higher in older patients than younger patients 328 versus 177 p0015 while normal leukocytes range 08 to 4109 cellsl were observed in most patients 185 774we next evaluated laboratory biomarkers of c-reactive protein albumin lymphocytes and blood urea nitrogen on days 0 7 and 14 figure 3 first serum levels of c-reactive protein were higher 3011 mgl in older patients at hospital admission but it dropped sharply after treatment and returned to the normal status 52 mgl on day 14 in contrast the lower level of c-reactive protein was observed in younger patients 121 mgl at baseline and it decreased slowly compared with that in older patients second lymphocytes increased from 114109 cellsl at baseline to 134109 cellsl on day 7 and 146 109 cellsl on day 14 similar increasing patterns were observed for blood urea nitrogen from baseline 422 mmoll to day 14 564 mmoll third serum levels of albumin in older patients continuously decreased from 3556 gl at baseline to 346 gl on day 7 and 336 gl on day 14the median duration from symptom onset to virus clearance was 19 days interquartile range 15 to 28 days this duration was much longer in older patients than younger patients 24 versus 19 days p0014 figure 4a compared with younger patients older patients had longer hospital stays 18 versus 15 days p0047 figure 4b we further analyzed the associations of baseline biomarkers with the short 3 weeks or long 3 weeks hospital stay in older and younger patients supplementary table 1 blood urea nitrogen was significantly lower in older patients with a short hospital stay than older patients with a long hospital stay p-value0037 compared to older patients younger patients with a short hospital stay usually had lower baseline levels of c-reactive protein and aspartate aminotransferase but higher levels of lymphocytes albumin and albuminglobulin at baseline p-values005 supplementary table 1by march 15th 2020 237 992 patients fulfilled the discharge criteria and a 58-year-old male and a 64-year-old male had died after the 14-day hospitalization 129 patients were diagnosed with virus clearance and 101 of them were discharged for 14-day home isolation after hospital discharge the presence of sars-cov-2 was not reported in any discharged patient over a follow-up period of two monthsbased on a cohort of 239 patients our study revealed three major findings i older and younger patients exhibited differences in dyspnea comorbidities and proportions of severe cases ii compared with younger patients older patients exhibited higher levels of c-reactive protein d-dimer aspartate aminotransferase blood urea nitrogen and lower levels of lymphocytes hemoglobin platelet albumin at baseline and iii the disease progression of sars-cov-2 was associated with the dynamics of laboratory biomarkers such as c-reactive protein and lymphocytes supporting their clinical use in disease monitoringsars-cov-2 is a highly pathogenic coronavirus of bat origin 11 that causes upper respiratory tract diseases and pneumonia-like diseases 3 9 increased mortality risk was previously reported in critically ill patients with chronic comorbidities and acute respiratory distress syndrome 9 similar to the prevalence of older patients in wuhan 4 58 243 of 239 patients were 60 years in our study although the cutoff of 60 years was used to categorize older and younger patients key factors such as comorbidities severe cases lymphocytes and c-reactive protein showed increasing or decreasing patterns over seven age groups figure 1 in agreement with previous studies 5 severe cases were often observed in older patients in our study table 1 older patients often have many comorbidities such as diabetes hypertension and cardiovascular disease which potentially cause the difficulty of clinical treatment fever cough and fatigue were common symptoms but there were no differences in older and younger patients indicating that symptoms and signs were not unique features to distinguish the impact of sars-cov-2 in both groups however dyspnea was more common in older patients implying the potential risk of lung lesions after sars-cov-2 infectionin agreement with previous studies 6 12 13 our study revealed key laboratory markers such as white blood cells lymphocytes eosinophils c-reactive protein albumin blood urea nitrogen aspartate aminotransferase and lactic acid these biomarkers are commonly used to monitor disease progression inflammatoryimmune responses andor physiological changes associated with viral infections for instance lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that could play protection roles in defending viral infections 14 lymphocytopenia might be a biomarker to reveal disease severity or antiviral immunity 15 lymphocytopenia was observed in 51 213 patients in our study while this percentage was lower than the national study 832 3 this discordance may be due to the condition of mildly ill patients in our cohort and timely antiviral treatment moreover c-reactive protein was much higher in older patients 3011 mgl versus 1211 mgl indicating that severe inflammatory reactions could be observed in older patients whether these biomarkers could be effective predictors of treatment responses requires further investigationsthis study has several limitations first our study characterized older and younger patients in changsha but the clinical features of older patients should be analyzed from a global perspective including those from different countries second we evaluated the dynamics of laboratory biomarkers in a 14-day period because of data availability but future studies should report the full course of disease progression third only two deaths were observed in our study and future studies should characterize the mortality risk of older patients in larger cohortsoverall our study characterized the clinical features of younger and older patients infected with sars-cov-2 older and younger patients exhibited differences in dyspnea comorbidities and proportions of severe cases higher levels of c-reactive protein aspartate aminotransferase blood urea nitrogen and lower levels of lymphocytes and albumin were observed in older patients furthermore the dynamics of laboratory biomarkers such as lymphocytes and c-reactive protein can be used for monitoring the disease progression in older patientsthis study was conducted at the first hospital of changsha designated as the single hospital to treat all sars-cov-2 cases in changsha patients who were infected with laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 according to the who interim guidance 16 were transferred from local hospitals to the first hospital of changsha between january 23 and march 15 2020 clinical outcomes were monitored up to the hospital discharge of all patients this study was performed following the helsinki declaration and was approved by the ethics committee of the first hospital of changsha in light of the rapid emergence of sars-cov-2 written informed consent was waived for this observational study the corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publicationwe retrieved electronic medical records clinical symptoms or signs laboratory findings comorbidities and hospitalization information of hospitalized patients infected with sars-cov-2 clinical information was retrieved using a customized collection form any missing or uncertain record was clarified by direct communications with doctors and patients to verify data accuracy two study investigators hyx and ccl reviewed the clinical data independentlyto identify the presence of sars-cov-2 throat swab specimens were collected for real-time rt-pcr analyses using the slan-96p real-time pcr system hongshitech shanghai china and sars-cov-2 nucleic acid diagnostic kits pcr-fluorescent probe from sansure biotech changsha china the latter was approved by the china national medical products administration registration number 20203400064 and the european ce approval id cmb 8764-2020 the detection limit of this nucleic acid kit was 200 copiesml sars-cov-2 tests were independently conducted at two medical centers the first hospital of changsha and the changsha municipal center for disease prevention and control a positive case was reported if sars-cov-2 was identified by two medical centers above while a negative case was reported if two medical centers consistently reported an undetectable viral load negative cases were considered from their discharge if they fulfilled three requirements i no respiratory symptoms of fever or cough were observed for three consecutive days ii two consecutive nucleic acid tests were negative three days apart from each test and iii computed tomography images became normal all discharged cases remained on home isolation for another 14 dayscomputed tomography ct diagnostics were performed using the 128-slice somatom go top ct systems from siemens healthineers hematologic assessments of white blood cells hemoglobin lymphocytes neutrophils eosinophils and platelets were proceeded using the mindray bc-6800 automated hematology analyzer biochemical data of albumin alanine aminotransferase albuminglobulin aspartate aminotransferase blood urea nitrogen creatinine c-reactive protein d-dimer and total bilirubin were quantified using the architect c16000 clinical chemistry analyzerbased on the new coronavirus diagnosis and treatment guideline version 7 in china a severe case was classified if a patient had any of the following conditions i respiratory distress with the respiration rate 30 times per minute ii oxygen saturation 93 in the resting state iii the ratio of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen 300 mmhg 1mmhg  0133 kpa and iv the area of the lung affected with pneumonia increased 50 within 24 to 48 hours non-severe cases included mild or moderate patients who had the conditions of fever 375c andor the respiratory tractwe measured median interquartile range of continuous variables as well as counts and percentages of categorical variables normal distribution was examined by shapiro-wilks normality tests to explore differences between patient groups the chi-square and fishers exact tests were conducted for categorical variables two-tailed t-tests were performed for continuous variables following normal distributions the wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for non-normal continuous variables in paired groups mann-whitney u tests were applied for non-normal continuous variables in unpaired groups a common approach called pairwise deletion was applied to handle missing data statistical analyses were conducted using spss 160 differences were considered significant at p005the study and management of lung diseases is of concern to allergistimmunologists and pulmonologists the most common chronic lung disease is asthma but there is an immunological basis for many other lung diseases which span a vast clinical spectrum of lung disorders ranging from infectious lung disease to cancer several significant challenge areas include the diagnosis and treatment of certain specific infectious lung diseases including viral lower respiratory infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus rhinovirus metapneumovirus coronovirus and enterovirus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-coa was responsible for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in the early 2000s that originated in asia and led to significant mortality in those afflicted other viruses such as bird flu and swine flu have the ability to cause respiratory tract disease as well tuberculosis is another primarily respiratory infection that has been resistant to eradication new strains of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis have emerged other challenges involve the genetic diseases cystic fibrosis and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency autoimmune lung diseases lung diseases that are part of a systemic autoimmune disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd the diagnosis and treatment of hypersensitivity pneumonitis still poses problems to clinicians biomarkers are continually being developed in lung and other cancers but more research is needed 1 the genetics of cystic fibrosis are now well elucidated but the development of a successful gene therapy has been unexpectedly slow table 1
for many of these conditions it was and still is expected that the ongoing development of new waves of molecular biology techniques coupled with computerized automated analysis that can provide transcription signatures will help identify differences between patients with these diseases and spur on the development of relevant and effective treatments the subsequent discussion takes on some of the more interesting and challenging issues in respiratory disease over the past two decades with a focus on what to expect in the future as wellasthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide the who estimates that there are over 300 million asthmatics worldwide and 250000 deaths per year in the usa there are 22 million asthmatics 65 million of whom are children until recently the mortality rates from asthma had been steadily increasing it is only in the past 510 years that the mortality rates have begun to stabilize and are perhaps even on a declinethe increasing incidence of asthma has been attributed to various theories perhaps the most popular of which is the hygiene hypothesis 2 this attributes the rise in incidence to the reduced rate of infectious diseases cleaner living environments and in general those features that accompany a higher standard of living but conversely the annual death rates per 100000 asthmatics tend to be higher in the economically poorer countries this emphasizes the most significant global concern regarding asthma care which is access to care and medications in developed countries this problem is less prevalent and in countries such as the usa we are primarily focused on asthma education and compliance issues in both situations severe asthma is still a problem in that it impacts quality of life and still contributes to considerable morbidity and mortalityone of the problems of severe asthma is related to defining the disease asthma is inherently very heterogeneous and many phenotypes of severe asthma have been described it is increasingly clear that there is no single medication that works for all patients with severe asthma while patient compliance is an issue we frequently fall into the trap of believing the problem is always patient compliance when in fact it may be that patients are not taking their medications because they perceive that they do not work nevertheless the explosive growth in the availability of new pharmaceutical interventions provides us with an arsenal of controller medications at least in the developed world more medications are being developed every day including the newer class of biological modulators against cytokines and chemokines 3 such as anti-il5 4 5 and anti-il4r 6 7 the next challenge will involve the identification of suitable patients for these new and existing treatmentsbut how will this be done researchers over the years have attempted to define asthma phenotypes trying to categorize asthma patients based on demographic and clinical characteristics in an attempt to define certain patient groups for certain preferential treatments 816 in general this has led to more confusion as the different research groups do not necessarily come up with the same classifications moreover asthma in children is also significantly different from that in adults and the response to medications varies based on multiple and not a single factor the choice and exclusion of confounding variables has been a thorn in the side of those attempting to define a specific asthma phenotype it has also not been found that specific childhood asthma phenotype will develop into a specific adult asthma phenotypethe concept of asthma endotypes has now been the subject of much research because endotypes address the underlying mechanism of a disease 1720 however this is also confusing because of the highly redundant inflammatory pathways that can lead to disease the use of biomarkers to identify those patients who are at high risk for severe life-threatening exacerbations has not been entirely fruitful the recent commercial introduction of fractional exhaled nitric oxide feno to identify patients with eosinophilic inflammation is a potentially useful tool but more is needed to guide treatmentthe identification of a gene for asthma has revealed that this is more complex than one might have expected there are now over 100 genes that have been attributed to asthma some of the more likely candidates include adam33 ormdl3 dennd1b filaggrin chi3l1 and il-33 moreover the existence of shared genes between asthma and other comorbid conditions such as obesity has also been demonstrated 21ultimately asthma like many other diseases is a heterogeneous disease with many phenotypes and endotypes 17 18 not one single treatment will fit all and the art of medicine may be to find the right peg for the corresponding hole 22 the twenty-first century has ushered the concept of personalized or genomic medicine which utilizes advancements in molecular biology such as proteomics metabolomics and genomics to identify the optimal therapy for each individual patientit has now been 24 years since the identification of the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis cf 2329 the initial study describing the gene named cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor cftr was first published in the late 1980s by tsui et al 26 2936 this discovery led to a localization of the gene to chromosome 7 leading to widespread belief that a cure for cf utilizing gene therapy was right around the corner the landmark development of a molecular biology technique which became known as genetic targeting in mice pioneered by capecchi 3740 evans 41 42 and smithies 4347 promised gene replacement in humans in a similar way to that performed in mice twenty-four years later there are new advancements in the management of cystic fibrosis with regard to pharmacological and supportive respiratory treatment but still no cure these advancements have prolonged the longevity of patients with cf but their life expectancy still only averages to be about 35 years so what happened to gene therapy what happened to all that promise that buoyed the cystic fibrosis community back in the 1980sthe idea behind gene therapy is to introduce a missing of malfunctioning gene into the cells of a patient using a harmless virus that can be manufactured to carry a normal copy of the diseased gene this technique can either target cells globally or be restricted to a certain group or location of cells but gene therapy has not progressed as smoothly or as quickly as anticipated previously unrecognized barriers became apparent 48 these included the fact that studies were initially focused on molecular or biochemical outcomes and not on clinical efficacy moreover the administration of the gene would need to be repeated due to epithelial turnover repeated administration leads to host recognition which may inhibit gene expression questions on which cells to target in order to achieve efficacy has slowed research the use of viral material including viral dna and liposomes could potentially lead to inflammatory responses the point is that unexpected consequences were discovered as research proceeded and this has had an impact on the progress of gene researchin 2012 a group of british investigators began large-scale trials of gene therapy delivered by encompassing the gene in fat globules and delivering the gene by nebulization future methodologies will utilize a viral delivery strategy but this is still several years into the future gene therapy for cystic fibrosis is not dead but certainly moving at a far slower pace than originally expectedcurrent treatments are not curative for cystic fibrosis gene therapy and stem cell transplants are two techniques that are still under investigation and it may turn out that only certain mutations may be candidates for gene therapy mutations in the cf gene have in fact been subclassified into six classes 49 each with its own pathogenic or physiologic characteristics for example the common f508del mutation results in reduced amounts of cftr channel expression which leads to exacerbation of the disease 50respiratory syncytial virus is an infection of the lower respiratory tract that causes significant morbidity and mortality in infants and young children 51 globally there are over 30 million new lower respiratory tract infections per year and approximately 200000 deaths per year in children fewer than 5 years of age the majority of these deaths occur in low-income countries where access to care may be limited the search for a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus rsv has been ongoing for many years but like the previous case of gene therapy in cystic fibrosis this also has been a challenge to achieve in the absence of a vaccine researchers have developed passive immunization to the virus in the form of a monoclonal antibody to rsv named palivizumab the current global strategies for the development of an rsv vaccine now target four areas infants 6 months of age infants 6 months of age and young children pregnant women for whom passive immunization can be implemented and the elderly in whom rsv can also have significant morbidity 5254the main challenges that have prevented the development of an effective vaccine so far revolve around the fact that even natural infection to rsv does not provide long-term protection from reinfection an earlier study actually found that the vaccine may actually accentuate the disease especially in young infants who may not have a fully mature immune system and may be unable to effectively engage in somatic mutation leading to a suboptimal b cell repertoire 55 56 this may also apply to older infants or young children who may still be rsv-naive the issues in adults are just the opposite as most adults have been exposed to rsv and thus have rsv antibodies the effectiveness of passively immunizing pregnant women in order to deliver igg across the placenta to the fetus must be weighed against possible adverse effects of such a vaccine on the fetus in the elderly the challenge has been the ability to boost immunity through active immunization in an individual who is becoming immunosenescentthere are now several vaccine development programs that pursue a variety of vaccine strategies a live virus vaccine trial has shown that a particular vaccine candidate medi-559 is safe although effectiveness has not been proven 57 other strategies include subunit rsv vaccines the use of dna-conjugate vaccines to boost antigen presentation and further development of passive antibody prophylaxis that is focused on f or g proteins 52 5872 an additional challenge with all of these strategies is that effective vaccine studies in animals have not been translated into successful human trialstuberculosis is a global health problem tuberculosis is an infection caused by the bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis which primarily affects the lung but can also affect other tissues including bone and the nervous system tuberculosis is believed to be one of the oldest infections to reportedly affect mankind with archeological and anthropological studies showing evidence of infection in humans over 4000 years ago it continues to top the charts of mortality and morbidity in developing nations it is estimated that in 2007 there were 927 million new cases of tb as well as a prevalence of 137 million the 132 million deaths in 2007 from tb in patients without hiv and 450000 deaths in patients with hiv is a shocking statistic that shows how far we have come yet how far we still are from effectively eradicating the disease 73two very effective drugs have been developed to treat tuberculosis isoniazid inh and rifampin however tuberculosis continues to be a global health problem tuberculosis is second to hivaids as the infection with the highest mortality globally more recently an increase in multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis mdr-tb has been observed with most cases from india china and russia there were 450000 reported cases of mdr-tb in the world in 2012 of these it is estimated that 96  fall into the category of xdr-tb which is an even more resistant form thus drug resistance is a significant challenge in the treatment of tb in the twenty-first century another challenge stems from the fact that about one third of patients with hivaids are infected with tb although many may not yet be symptomatic the who defines six core functions and six strategic approaches to combat tb table 1overall 80  of tb cases occur in just 22 countries and 60  of cases occur in china however as overall healthcare accessibility and technology improves there have been significant declines in the rate of tb in some of the asian countries including cambodia and china there is no dispute that the dots and stop tb strategy as outlined in table 1 have contributed to significant progress in the control of tb but significant challenges remain one of the areas that are being focused on now has to do with the identification of biomarkers biomarkers can play several roles in the improvement of treatment of tb in the world the main areas of focus for research in biomarkers are to identify those that can perform the following functions 1 prediction of a curative state 2 prediction of reactivation of tb and 3 prediction of immunity to tb in the past biomarkers for tb would normally involve culturing for the organism but the development of molecular biology techniques has afforded us the use of non-culture biomarkersthe types of approaches as described by wallis et al in 2013 74 categorize biomarker development into functional categories table 2 non-culture biomarkers include cytokine levels quantifiable genetic measures of the presence of tb other serological tests imaging techniques gene transcription profiles and micro-rna profiles the development of a vaccine has been an ongoing challenge in the quest for a cure for tb and limitations in these studies include the lack of valid biomarkers to assess protection in clinical trials
the cytokines interferon- and il-18 have been studied as biomarkers for latent tb infection a tuberculosis-stimulated interferon- release assay can detect sensitization to tb antigens but unfortunately cannot differentiate between resolved and persistent latent infection interleukin-18 is a marker of innate immunity elevated levels of plasma interleukin levels seen in tb patients indicate increased activation of innate immunity which was not observed in controls a chemokine that was observed to be elevated in tb were ccr7 75 while the levels of the apoptosis inhibitor bcl2 expression were reduced 76 77 il-18 levels actually correlated with the radiographic extent of the disease 78 79 hiv appears also to modify cytokine production in patients with tb 80 other cytokines and chemokines have been profiled as potential biomarkers for tb disease activity 8186 although to this date none has been shown to be useful for widespread clinical applicationfifty years ago it was the introduction of pyrazinamide and rifampicin that reduced the duration of therapy from 18 months to 6 months the value of biomarkers may be reflected in the implications of being able to predict cure and latency of infection as well as active infection from a therapeutic standpoint this may mean the difference between the current regimen of 6 months of treatment versus a possible reduction in the duration of therapy for certain patient groups but this depends on the biomarker being significantly accurate as to not lead to inadequate treatment of affected individualsthough a half century has passed since the development of effective treatment for drug-susceptible tb the period of treatment is still at least 6 months of standard therapy ie rifampicin and isoniazid for 6 months and pyrazinamde and ethambutol during the initial 2 months of treatment efforts to reduce the length of treatment are dependent on the discovery of more effective treatment as well as being able to monitor the treatment at the same time more and more patients with tb are demonstrating multiple drug resistance forms including mdr or xdr tb the addition of second-line drugs for the treatment of these more difficult to treat patients is plagued by longer periods of treatment higher cost and reduced efficacy the drugs often used for second-line treatment include aminoglycosides terizidone protionamide capreomycin fluroquinolones cycloserine and ethionamide the mortality of mdr and xdr tb in hiv patients is particularly high and researchers have focused on novel approaches to combat this global health issue including revamping of efforts to develop a vaccine for tb 8792 treatment of latent infection to reduce reservoir pools of infection and the development of predictive biomarkers one should not forget that for years we have had a vaccine for tb the bcg vaccine named after albert calmette and camille guerin while this vaccine has been used primarily in underdeveloped countries and has been administered to over 4 billion people worldwide the limitations include an inability to protect against adult tb and adverse effects when used in hiv-positive tb patients further research is ongoing to develop an improved replacement or enhancement vaccine for bcg 91 93100therefore as we develop new biomarkers and new treatment strategies one should remember that the infective landscape of tb is not a static target either the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains as mentioned above means that the disease may become more difficult to treat and that the development of biomarkers must take new medication use into consideration moreover the development of biomarkers requires the availability of large patient samples such as those that can be found in biobanks of large high-volume treatment centers the willingness of patients to contribute to research and the regulatory landscape for the collection of samples for research could potentially negatively impact the ability to conduct large-scale studies on biomarkers for a comprehensive review of biomarkers diagnostics drug treatment and vaccine development the reader is referred to an excellent series of articles published in lancet in 2010 74 89 101the incidence of pertussis appears to be increasing over the past 30 years this trend flies in the face of an availability of first the killed whole organism pertussis vaccine dtwp and subsequently the acellular vaccine dpap the acellular vaccine was less reactogenic because it incorporated a step during manufacturing that removed endotoxin which was a major reason for the adverse side effect profile it was clear that vaccination against pertussis afforded much improved prevention of the disease as illustrated by the 157-fold decreased rate for pertussis between the 1930s and 1940s dtwp vaccines were used until the 1990s when technological development in the 1970s and 1980s led to the introduction of commercially available acellular pertussis vaccines 102the continuing increase in pertussis cases leads to an obvious question is this a failure of an immunization program earlier we discussed several examples that illustrate the difficulty of bringing an effective vaccine to market tb and rsv the problems associated with pertussis are clearly different there are several reasons that may explain why we have not eradicated the disease it is well documented that the dtap vaccine is not as immunogenic as the whole organism dtwp vaccines studies have indicated that the overall efficacy of dtap vaccines is below 70  we do not normally test for pertussis titers following vaccination except in studies but there are those who suggest that the increase in pertussis cases is mainly due to the increased ability to diagnose the disease and to an increased awareness yet another challenge may be that pertussis has mutated over the years rendering the vaccine less effective because our current vaccine is 70  effective the ability of mutant strains to evade destruction would lead to their preferential survivalit has been shown that pertussis vaccine which contains more antigens such as the five-component vaccine that contains pertussis toxin pt filamentous hemagglutinin fha pertactin prn and fimbriae fim 23 is superior to those containing fewer antigens it has also become apparent that the balance of antigens in the vaccine may play a role in determining efficacy for example a whole-cell pertussis vaccine with antigenic components pt fha and fim was compared to an acellular pertussis vaccine in children the whole-cell vaccine produced high levels of antibodies to prn and fim but low levels to pt and fha in contrast to the acellular pertussis vaccine which produced high levels of antibody to pt and fha more than one study has suggested that the vaccine components may antagonize each other it has been found that the antibody levels to fha do not correlate with the efficacy of the vaccine furthermore it has been suggested that adding fha to a vaccine may actually suppress efficacylinked epitope suppression is another concept to explain the failure of pertussis vaccines while one would expect that the presence of antigens that do not deliver a brisk vaccine response should not affect the response to other vaccine antigens this may not be the case if there were a linkage suppression between two epitopes on the pertussis vaccine then this could be a significant consideration in vaccine design as one would then need to exclude certain antigens from the vaccine component mix suffice to say that vaccine development is a very complex topic and it involves various techniques including the use of classical adjuvants such as aluminum salts emulsions or liposomes or novel adjuvants such as toll-like-receptor agonists saponins or immune stimulating complexes 103one cannot discuss challenges in pertussis without commenting on the fear of immunizations held by many families even in developed countries such as the usa the refusal of many parents to immunize their children for whatever reason they may have plays a significant role in our inability to eradicate several diseases including pertussis measles rubella and so on this phenomenon is not limited to the uneducated population as many highly educated individuals appear to choose not to subject their children to the relatively miniscule real or imagined risks of immunizations certainly one has an astronomically higher risk of being killed in a car accident than dying from a vaccination and yet people who refuse to vaccinate their children do not stop driving or riding in carsthe problem with all this is that achieving herd immunity is important in total eradication this means that if only a very small portion of the population do not immunize their children there is still a possibility of eradicating a disease but as more people choose to remain unimmunized the likelihood of successful eradication becomes less and less unfortunately people who choose to remain unimmunized fail to understand that in order that everyone not have to get immunized in the future as in the case of smallpox everyone must be immunized in the present 104severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars was an infection that reached epidemic proportions during the early part of the 2000s it originated in china and rapidly spread to neighboring countries and eventually it was reported in many other distant nations including europe and the usa although the number of cases was far fewer by several orders of magnitude than the common flu it caught the attention of healthcare professionals and public health officers because of its high mortality with 8000 cases and 774 deaths reported between 2002 and 2003 for a mortality rate of 96  sars was later identified to be caused by a coronavirus and was named sars-coa travel histories of infected people were instrumental in tracing the origin of the disease 105but where did this virus come from and how did it suddenly cause so much havoc initially in may of 2003 the virus was traced to civets a cat-like mammal that is occasionally consumed as food by the chinese however these creatures were eventually dismissed as the original source because of the lack of appearance of further infected civets in 2005 reservoirs of sars-like viruses were found in chinese horseshoe bats these were often brought to market and it was thought that the virus was passed to humans at that time phylogenetic studies further provided evidence that genetically it was likely that the sars coronavirus evolved from viruses that infected the horseshoe bats 105112so can sars happen again in fact smaller outbreaks that do not attract as much attention may already be occurring in a manner that mimics sars a middle east respiratory syndrome or mers has been reported to also be caused by a coronavirus the mortality in this case is high as well 38 of 64 cases or 50  112122 mers is also thought to have originated in bats interestingly many other viruses are thought to be transmitted by bats including ebola hendra and rabies the cellular receptor for mers is cd26 or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 123lessons learned from the 2003 sars epidemic included the fact that transmission can often be facilitated by the very medical workers who are trying to save patients 109 110 strict infection control measures are critical in limiting the spread of the disease including the use of negative pressure rooms n95 masks and gowns the optimal dosing of antiviral medications and the timing of supportive measures of respiratory care are still unknown but previous experience should guide us to be more vigilant if this ever occurs in a large-scale fashion in the futureanti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody anca was discovered in 1982 124 125 the antigenic targets of anca include myeloperoxidase or proteinase-3 and the antibodies against these antigens were for a long time referred to as p-anca and c-anca respectively the p and c indicating their cellular staining pattern perinuclear or cytoplasmic this latter nomenclature has since been discouraged and the antibodies should be referred to in the context of their specific antigenic target 126 127an understanding of the pathogenesis of anca-associated vasculitis aav would help in the development of more effective drugs to treat this group of diseases 125 which include granulomatosis with polyangiitis formerly wegeners granulomatosis eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis egpa or churgstrauss disease and microscopic polyangiitis 128for toxin-mediated aav a meta-analysis has shown a link between crystalline silica and aav 129 silica is an inflammasome activator and is believed to trigger the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to the disease other triggers include drugs most commonly hydralazine propylthiouracil and penicillamine all of which are known to stimulate b lymphocyte activation and infectious trigger such as staphylococcus aureus avoidance of exposure may prove to be a useful methodology to prevent disease but as of this time the triggers of aav are too diverse and too controversial to recommend any particular avoidance strategyanother disease state that affects millions perhaps billions of people worldwide is allergies allergies that affect the respiratory tract can take the form of allergic asthma or simply allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis the hygiene hypothesis would indicate that because of our cleaner living environments we are developing higher rates of sensitivities to common allergens both indoor and outdoor as well as higher rates of autoimmune diseases 130136 one of the main avenues of treatment has always been avoidance but we have not really been able to define what exactly constitutes effective avoidance many of the studies done on dust mite and animal dander avoidance have not been able to identify a single avoidance measure that can make a significant impact on outcome although perhaps a comprehensive avoidance plan may provide some relief studies are needed to 1 determine whether indeed effective avoidance is possible in the face of indoor and outdoor exposures to allergens and 2 the extent to which avoidance of allergens if possible provides a significant benefit to patientsthe diagnosis and management of respiratory diseases is plagued by numerous unmet needs affecting both common diseases such as asthma to uncommon occurrences such as sars some of the problems are common and ultimately involve improving our understanding of the mechanisms of disease only then can we develop tools to help us manage these patients the advent of molecular biology has allowed us to develop genetic analyses of patients and this has led to a realization that these diseases are frequently not one disease but many 137 thus the genomic and personalized medicine acts of 2006 and 2010 are important legislatures that will hopefully divert increased funding into studies that will help us identify which treatment should optimally be used on which patient 138 139 understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases is another significant unmet need which requires commitment of funding and resources 140 the respective contributory roles of genes epigenetics and the environment in the pathogenesis of lung diseases must be better elucidated 141148 with better understanding of disease comes better diagnostic markers and better treatmentother unmet needs circle around the availability of biomarkers to both diagnose disease and vaccines and other novel treatments to manage disease new techniques for vaccination which will hopefully alleviate concerns of vaccines among vaccine-apprehensive patients may help lead to the eradication of infectious respiratory disease such as tb pertussis and rsv there is much work yet to be done and it is important to remember that diseases are not static either especially in the context of pathogen-related diseases as pathogens are also very adept at evading our efforts to destroy themthe challenges outlined in this article are far from comprehensive and specific unmet needs exist for a variety of other respiratory diseases including alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency hypersensitivity pneumonitis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease lung cancer pulmonary hypertension in the newborn and others while each disease state may have its own unique set of challenges in general one can categorize these into three major areas of need namely diagnosis treatment and prevention fig 1 more specifically these would include the identification of biomarkers to provide less invasive methods for the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease as well as determining prognosis the development of new drugs and treatment modalities and also the development of vaccines or other environmental controls to reduce the incidence of the disease
community-acquired pneumonia cap is a frequently seen disease with high morbidity and mortality accounting for 600000 hospitalizations each year it represents the seventh leading cause of death in the usa 1 cap prognosis depends on the rapidity of specific treatment which should ideally be initiated within four hours and no later than eight hours after diagnosis 2 3 cap diagnosis is based on the clustering of non-specific pulmonary and general symptoms 4 5 an increase in biomarkers reflecting systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs and the presence of new parenchymal infiltrates on chest x-ray however cap diagnosis remains uncertain in many cases with alternative diagnoses such as cardiac failure acute bronchitis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd exacerbations pulmonary embolism neoplasia and sepsis 6 7part of the uncertainty of cap diagnosis may be due to the high rate of chest x-ray misdiagnosis 8 9 over diagnosis of cap is frequent when infiltrates of non-infectious origin coexist with pulmonary or general symptoms and the diagnosis of cap is often ignored when the lung infiltrates are at the limit of visibility or are hidden due to superposition 10 we recently published a study in which thoracic ct scan was systematically performed in a population of clinically suspected cap patients visiting the emergency department for cap the escaped study 11 we showed that cap diagnosis based on chest x-ray led to a false cap diagnosis in many patients among cap suspected patients with radiological pulmonary infiltrate cap diagnosis was excluded in around 30  of patients based on ct scan results on the contrary among patients without radiological pulmonary infiltrate one-third had a pulmonary infiltrate on thoracic ct-scan we also reported the isolation of viruses in one-third of patients 11 12several attempts have been made to improve cap diagnosis based on biomarkers such as c-reactive protein crp and procalcitonin pct however there are conflicting data on their reliability 1317 this could be due to the consideration of cap diagnosis based on chest x-ray as establishing pulmonary infection in the present study we aimed to analyze crp and pct values in the population of the escaped study reported above for whom cap diagnosis was established by an adjudication committee which founded its judgment on all usual available data systematic multidetector thoracic ct scan performed at inclusion and results from a day-28 follow-up we also analyzed whether the viral etiology of definite cap based on polymerase chain reaction pcr multiplex naso-pharyngeal swab interfered with the accuracy of the biomarkersescaped was a multicenter prospective interventional study entitled early thoracic ct-scan for community-acquired pneumonia at the emergency department escaped 11 conducted from november 2011 to january 2013 in four emergency departments eds of four tertiary teaching hospitals in paris france designed to measure the impact of thoracic ct scan on clinical decision the study was sponsored and monitored by the paris public health hospitals and funded by the french ministry of health the french health authorities agence nationale de scurit des medicaments et produits de sant ansm and the institutional review board for the protection of human subjects approved the study protocol and patient informed consent procedures all enrolled patients provided written informed consent for inclusion the protocol was registered in the clinicaltrialgov website under the pacscan acronym the french translation of the english escaped acronym nct01574066 the ethics committee of ile de france comit de protection des personnes paris n 2011-oct-12749 approved the study protocolthe primary objective was to compare crp and pct values in the four different categories of cap level of certainty using the day-28 adjudication committee classification the four categories were 1 absence of cap hereafter referred to as excluded cap diagnosis 2 possible cap 3 probable cap and 4 definite cap the secondary objectives were to assess whether crp and pct were associated with cap diagnosis using sensitivity analyses in three successive subgroups chosen a priori 1 when specifically considering patients classified as having excluded cap diagnosis and definite cap ie the patients for whom the level of certainty was the highest 2 when patients with excluded cap diagnosis and diagnosed extra-pulmonary infectious disease which may increase biomarker values were not taken into account in the excluded cap group and 3 when patients classified as viral cap were not taken into account in the definite cap group as pct has been reported to be lower in viral infections as compared to bacterial infections 18consecutive adults 18 years of age and above visiting the participating eds were enrolled if the attending emergency physician clinically suspected cap clinical suspicion of cap was based on the investigators own judgment and had to fulfill the following criteria new onset of systemic features at least one among sweat chills aches and pain temperature 38 c or 36 c and symptoms of an acute lower respiratory tract illness at least one among cough sputum production dyspnea chest pain altered breathing sounds at auscultation pregnant women patients in palliative care or with anticipated barriers to completing follow-up data collection patients classified 3 according to the crb65 score and those requiring intensive care for any purpose due to specific management of critically ill cap patients were not eligible this study examined patients from the escaped study for whom the crp and pct values and the multiplex pcr results were all availablepatient management was based on local practices in the emergency departments no recommendation was given concerning the performance of crp and pct dosage as no dosages are recommended in french cap guidelines recorded baseline data consisted of demographic data age gender coexisting illnesses symptoms clinical findings and laboratory tests for each individual crb65 and pneumonia severity index psi were calculated 19multidetector thoracic ct-scan was performed after chest x-ray ideally within the four hours following inclusion chest x-ray and thoracic ct-scan were performed using a standardized protocol the four levels of cap probability according to ct scan were defined as definite systematic alveolar condensation alveolar condensation with peripheral and localized ground glass opacities bronchiolar focal or multifocal micronodules probable peripheral alveolar condensation retractile systematic alveolar condensation or diffuse ground glass opacities possible pulmonary infarct or excluded pulmonary mass other abnormalities or normal images scan views were recorded on a dvdbased on data collected from baseline standardized case report forms dvd recorded pictures of x-ray and ct-scan and blinded to local interpretations an adjudication committee consisting of three independent senior experts in infectious diseases pneumology and radiology retrospectively assigned the probability of cap diagnosis using the same 4-level likert scale with all available data including patients discharge summary and follow-up data obtained by assistant investigators who contacted by phone either the patient relatives or general practitioners at day 28 for this study the gold standard of cap was the diagnosis assessed by this adjudication committee alternative diagnoses were established for excluded cap and classified as non-cap pulmonary diseases and extra-pulmonary infectious diseases and othersblood samples were collected at inclusion in sodium heparin-treated tubes centrifuged and stored at 40 c until completion of the study crp

described by means and standard deviations sd or by median and interquartile range iqr for continuous variables normally distributed or with skewed distribution respectively and by percentages for categorical variables for the total study population and for the study groups we performed chi-square or fisher exact tests when appropriate for qualitative variables and the student or mannwhitney tests for continuous variables with skewed distributions to compare baseline patient characteristics and study outcomes between study groupsthe distribution values of the biomarkers were determined in the different populations of patients using boxplots the performances of crp and pct in predicting definite cap were evaluated by sensitivity analysis definite cap vs excluded cap crp was evaluated at several cut-off points of 20 mgl 30 mgl 50 mgl 70 mgl and 100 mgl values used in previous studies 15 20 21 several cut-off points for pct were chosen at the level of 010 gl 18 and at the two levels

study is novel as patients prospectively benefited from extensive investigation to determine the diagnosis of cap in the ed including both early multidetector thoracic ct-scan and day-28 adjudication committee this led to the correction of cap diagnosis previously based on chest x-ray in a high number of patients in these extensively characterized patients both crp and pct lacked operational precision to allow the decision-making process to rule out or confirm diagnosis of cap even in selected subgroupsthe clinical characteristics of the patients included in this sub-study are consistent with those in the current literature as previously reported patients frequently had a history of respiratory disorders cancer and congestive heart failure 21 22 the design of the escaped study required exclusion of patients within the highest crb 65 categories which limited the inclusion of patients older than 65 this may explain why the mean age of our patients 64 years falls within the lower values of those reported elsewhere 19 data to identify the microbial agent responsible for the disease were collected by the usual techniques and multiplex pcr viral identification using naso-pharyngeal pcr that revealed viral respiratory infection in approximately one-third of cases was concordant with values reported in the literature 23 therefore we believe that our results can be extrapolated to most emergency patients suffering from capin the present study patients were recruited on the basis of initial clinical assessment for the diagnosis of cap therefore we believe that the characteristics of the patients closely correspond to those that lead practitioners to consider a possible diagnosis of cap in these patients the design of our study allowed us to confirm or refute cap diagnosis with a high level of certainty results confirmed the poor predictive value of clinical symptoms new onset of systemic features and symptoms of an acute lower respiratory tract illness in identifying cap patients 21 indeed clinical presentation of excluded cap patients was similar to that of definite cap patients except for fever and cough that were more frequent in definite cap patients furthermore the design also revealed that the combination of clinical symptoms and chest x-ray results led to cap misdiagnosis in a high number of patients including the 98 whose cap diagnosis was excluded by the adjudication committee and who would have been considered as possible probable or definite cap without the use of the ct scan this low specificity of clinical-standard radiological evaluation led to the consideration of either non-infectious pulmonary diseases such as cardiac failure pulmonary embolism pulmonary neoplasia or bronchitis or extra-pulmonary infectious diseases as cap of note some of these diseases are also associated with increased biomarker values this raises concerns about previous evaluations of biomarkers in cap-suspected patients which used clinical and standard radiological chest x-ray evaluations as the gold standard for cap diagnosis 15the use of biomarkers has been advocated to improve diagnosis and management of patients with lower respiratory tract infections 14 however this issue is still unresolved 24 with conflicting positions 14 15 25 26 in our study while median values of both biomarkers did increase with level of certainty for cap diagnosis we were unable to establish discriminating values for pct recent data suggested that crp could be of more help in assisting in the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections lrti 15 27 28 in our study although crp seems more discriminating than pct neither the experimental exclusion of extra-pulmonary bacterial infections from the excluded cap group nor the exclusion of viral cap from the definite cap patients group made possible the determination of a discriminant cutoff the combination of crp and pct was not more discriminating than each biomarker separately an operational algorithm has been released to assist physicians in prescribing antimicrobial therapy 14 26 29 according to this strategy a pct concentration higher than 025 gl should prompt administration of antibiotics to patients with suspected lrti in our study this value was associated with poor performance additionally mean pct levels remained above this threshold both in excluded cap patients without infectious disorders and in definite cap presumably related to virus therefore the gold standard for the diagnosis of cap may influence the performance and utility of pct in this settingthis study has some limitations first the adjudication committee was not blinded to the value of biomarkers measured at bedside in some patients 70 for crp and 131 for pct and its cap classification could thus have been influenced by these results however the lack of statistically significant differences in the mean crp and pct values in the definite cap cases whether or not these biomarkers were available for the adjudication committee argues against a major impact of these results on adjudication committee classification second another critical point is the prescription of antibiotic therapy 34  previous to inclusion we cannot exclude that these previously-treated cap patients may have altered biomarker performance and reduced the yield of bacterial cultures although such a population reflects the usual emergency department practice third multiplex pcr was performed on naso-pharyngeal sampling and not on lower respiratory tract samples which does not allow definite confirmation of the viral origin of cap however a recent large study on cap patients which reported a viral etiology of cap at a comparable rate did not find upper respiratory tract shedding in a control population without cap explored during the same year and season 30 finally even if multidetector thoracic ct scan is a better imaging examination than x-ray to explore the chest only invasive local microbiological samples would have provided a diagnosis with certaintygiven the diversity of the clinical and radiological cap presentations cap diagnosis is often uncertain in our population of patients treated in the emergency room with clinical symptoms evoking cap neither crp nor pct cut-off values carried sufficient weight to confirm or refute cap diagnosis at bedside this underlines that these biomarkers are telltales of the host inflammatory response to the intrusion of microorganisms independent of the site of infection these results based on a systematic thoracic ct scan evaluation of cap-suspected patients do not argue for the use of crp and pct in routine care to diagnose cap with certainty in patients visiting the ed for suspected capthe predictive value of clinical symptoms in identifying cap patients is poorno crp or pct cut-off value is sufficiently discriminating to confirm or refute cap diagnosis with a high level of certaintythe diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers was not improved when cap cases considered as viral were excluded from analysisa coronavirus designated by the world health organization as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and by the coronavirus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has been spreading worldwide producing the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 although its mechanism of infection is still not known it has affinity for and replicates in cells located in the lower airways the most characteristic clinical sign is the production of a respiratory distress syndrome that can range from mild malaise to death having worse prognosis in elderly patients with comorbidities 1 in addition one of the symptoms referred by many patients is the loss of sensory acuity including smell and taste 2 on the 18th of april the number of cases worldwide was 2261034 with 154726 deathssaliva has been increasingly used over the last few decades for evaluating human health it is an integrated mixture of secretions of the different salivary glands desquamated oral epithelial cells gingival crevicular fluid and different microorganisms 3 it also contains a large number of proteins such as immunoglobulins mucins and enzymes as well as metabolites hormones and electrolytes this composition allows the detection of pathogens in saliva and also the quantification of biomarkers that can provide information about the immunological inflammatory endocrine and metabolic status of the individual in some cases its value to detect physiological changes is similar or superior to serum such as for the detection of acute stress by alpha-amylase or cortisol 4 overall saliva appears to be a fluid of enormous potential in health assessment especially due to the clinical information that it can provide and the non-invasive nature of its collection which can be performed by individuals without particular training and with no major requirements in terms of equipment or facilitiescurrently naso and oropharyngeal swabs are the two main recommended upper respiratory tract specimen types for covid-19 diagnostic testing although the use of saliva for the diagnosis of the disease has been recently suggested 56 furthermore in recent days a test for assessing the rna in saliva samples was approved by the us food and drug administration 7the objective of this report is to provide updated information about the use of saliva as a sample for laboratory analysis in covid-19 investigations for this purpose the advantages of the use of this biofluid are described and the scientific evidence is presented which supports the concept that the analysis of saliva in patients with covid-19 could allow for the detection of the virus and antibodies produced against it as well as the assessment of the non-specific innate immune response finally the possibility of the use of saliva for finding new biomarkers in this disease and some general recommendations that could contribute to a more appropriate use of this sample will be highlightedthe use of naso and oropharyngeal swabs have several limitations such as the discomfort for the patient and the need for the intervention of a healthcare worker in a disease with a high risk of nosocomial transmission 8 these collection systems can also induce coughing and sneezing generating aerosol which can transmit the virus in addition in cases of thrombocytopenia or any other coagulation disorder this procedure can cause bleeding these drawbacks can limit the use of swabs especially in serial monitoring or mass test programs sputum has been also proposed as a non-invasive lower respiratory tract specimen but 72 of covid-19 patients were not able to produce it for collection 9 the difficulty of obtaining sputum also has been described in sars-cov a virus with many similarities with the covid-2019 especially at early stages of infection when no cough or only dry cough is present 10 the use of saliva could improve these drawbacks as it has the following advantages
-it can be collected by the patient even at home minimizing the exposure of health care workers to nosocomial infections this also reduces the need for health care personnel and waiting times for sample collection resulting in easier crowd control regulations in clinical settings and thus avoiding further virus transmission-it is easily accepted by the patients since it is non-painful and non-stressful therefore it can be used for serial samplings and in large scale or epidemiological studies being especially advantageous in certain populations such as children 11-it is easy fast and cheap to collect allowing widespread testingin the particular case of sars-cov-2 saliva could be used for evaluating different aspects of the disease as shown in figure 1 the evidence for which will be described in the following sectionscurrently there are publications from three different research groups that have used saliva for sars-cov-2 detection
-the group of dr to published two reports using saliva collected by asking the patient to cough out saliva from their throat into a sterile container and adding a viral transport medium to the sample 1213 these samples in addition to salivary gland secretions contained material from the posterior oropharynx that could have come from respiratory secretions swept up from the trachealbronchial tree and also secretions coming down from the nasopharynx in these reports the rna of the virus was identified in the saliva of 20 out of 23 patients who had previously been confirmed as infected by the detection of sars-cov-2 rna in their nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens giving an overall diagnostic sensitivity of 87 in addition saliva tested negative in 33 patients from whom nasopharyngeal specimens were negative for sars-cov-2 the detection of the virus was by a real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr and the range of values was from 99  102 copiesml to 12  108 copiesml -azzi et al 14 collected saliva through passive drool in cases of patients who were undergoing endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation the collection was performed intraorally by a physician with the use of a pipette these specimens possibly also contained respiratory secretions in these conditions sars-cov-2 was detected in all saliva samples collected from a group of 25 patients with severe to very severe disease who were diagnosed by detection of the virus in pharyngeal or bronchoalveolar swabs an rrt-pcr that detected a trend in viral load without quantification of the viral copies per millimeter was used for virus detectionin this study two patients who were monitored showed positive salivary results on the same days that their pharyngeal or bronchoalveolar swabs were negative this raises the possibility that individuals can be contagious through their saliva even when pharyngeal swabs are negative this could be a point in favor of the use of saliva for the virus detection and would be in line with the description of salivary glands as potential reservoirs for covid-19 in asymptomatic but infected people 15-han et al 16 collected saliva from a 27-day-old neonate diagnosed with covid-19 and reported values in the range of 105 copiesml that were similar to the values obtained with pharyngeal swabs but lower than those from bronchoalveolar swabssars-cov was detected in the saliva of 14 sars patients at high amounts ranging from 708  103 copiesml to 638  108 copiesml 10 in the same study throat wash by gargling 10 ml normal saline was collected in an airborne isolation room from all these patients and the supernatant was analyzed after centrifugation the amount of sars-cov rna in the saliva was greater than in the throat wash with values in the throat wash ranging from 958  102 copiesml to 593  106 copiesml 10 this high detection rate appeared at a median of four days after disease onset and before the appearance of lung lesions in another study lower values 5255  102 copiesml were obtained in the saliva of three patients with sars-cov 17 these divergent results could be influenced by the differences in the methods used and samples collected in an in vivo experiment in rhesus macaques after intranasal inoculations with a pathogenic sars-cov the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor positive epithelial cells lining the salivary gland ducts were target cells being infected at an early stage 18 sars-cov was readily detected in oral swabs in four infected macaques but in only two of them was the virus detected in lungs and it was not detected in blood in any animal this experiment suggests that the virus appears in saliva at an earlier stage of infection than in lungs and could reach saliva due to direct salivary gland infectionthe group of dr to using saliva samples obtained by the expectoration of saliva into a sterile container has reported a high concordance higher than 90 between saliva and nasopharyngeal specimens in the detection of coronavirus and other respiratory viruses and in some patients coronavirus was detected only in saliva but not in nasopharyngeal aspirate in addition they indicated that saliva can be used for the detection of patients who were subclinically infected with respiratory viruses the authors indicated that these collected saliva could be mixed with sputum because it was obtained by expectoration 19 in animals the rna of the coronavirus called porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv can be detected in the saliva of infected pigs by real-time pcr at the same time but at higher concentrations than in serum 2021 in other species of virus such as the flavivirus zika the virus can be detected in the saliva of infected human patients with higher sensitivity than in serum 22 in addition saliva is widely used in the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus infection 23another field where saliva may have a major potential for covid-19 is in screening for immunity there is scientific evidence that specific antibodies against infectious diseases can be detected in saliva 24 salivary igg and igm concentrations are much lower than in serum although it has been suggested that they are in a similar proportion in relation to total protein in saliva as in serum 25 in the particular case of igg plasma and saliva igg profiles are highly similar for a large number of antigens 26 it has been hypothesized that both salivary igg and igm are derived from blood whereas iga is mainly produced by the salivary glands 24the presence of igm and igg in serum against components of the virus such as 2019-ncovid nucleoprotein np and spike protein receptor binding domain rbd has been described in covid-19 patients 10 days or later after symptom onset 12 although to the authors knowledge there are presently no studies regarding antibodies in saliva in covid-19 in animal species there is evidence that saliva can be used for the assessment of antibody responses to coronavirus infections for example saliva igg and iga can be used to track levels of immunity against pedv disease over time 20 in addition saliva has been used in several viral diseases of humans for the detection of specific immunoglobulins to pathogens such as hepatitis a b and c human immunodeficiency virus and rubella virus 242728the detection of antibodies in saliva could be potentially used for the control of covid-19 as occurred with other infectious diseases for example for infection with rubella oral fluid testing has been offered by the public health laboratory service in the uk for cases notified to the office for national statistics ons in this program saliva samples are collected between two and six weeks after the onset of symptoms and tested for virus specific igm the assays used have been shown to be greater than 90 sensitive and specific 25 it could be expected that saliva will have similar value in covid-19 diagnosis and monitoring this is particularly interesting for two main reasons 1 as long as there is no effective treatment or vaccine and person-to-person transmission has to be minimized the possibility of identifying immune individuals will be invaluable in defining who and how particular individuals can be relieved from confinement and limited social contact 2 there is a lot to establish and understand about immunity dynamics during the disease and how long it remains after the individual has recovered 29in patients with covid-19 serum concentrations of acute phase proteins apps such as c-reactive protein crp and ferritin are increased in the cases that develop more severe disease their concentrations have been shown to correlate with the severity of the process 3031 in inflammatory conditions apps can increase before the appearance of clinical signs being very early biomarkers 32 in addition increases in serum of several interleukins il such as il-6 and il-10 have been described in covid-19 patients 33 and these cytokines are known to be mediators of the apps responsein humans and in animal models a high correlation in crp between serum and saliva has been demonstrated 1134 additionally other apps such as ferritin haptoglobin serum amyloid a different interleukins and other analytes related to the immune response such as adenosine deaminase ada can be measured in saliva 113536these analytes can potentially be used as salivary biomarkers to assess the severity of the process and also to predict the development of more severe cases in covid-19the use of proteomic techniques allows the identification of multiple proteins in saliva 37 by comparing these proteins between healthy individuals and those with disease it is possible to assess the differences which can result from changes in the circulating levels of proteins andor from changes in the salivary gland secretion associated with a disease these differences are valuable to understand the pathophysiological processes associated with the disease and identify biomarkers that may allow an early and easy diagnosis and have been studied in other viral diseases 38in covid-19 proteomic studies could allow for the discovery of new biomarkers for the disease and help to elucidate the loss of smell and taste by some patients 39 it is known that the saliva proteome is related to taste sensitivity 40 in this context potential changes in the saliva proteome in this disease may be associated with the reduced taste perceptionalthough saliva is a sample easy to collect general recommendations should be followed for its use some of which are particularly focused in the application to this disease as shown in table 11 the use of a standardized method of collectiondifferent methods can be used for saliva collection such as passive drool different absorbent materials or stimulation with citrate these methods may have in some cases interference with selected analytes in the particular case of the covid-19 two aspects should be addressed regarding the method of collection-the possible differences between saliva obtained by passive drool or absorbent materials and by clearing the throat should be evaluated in addition some patients might not be able to clear the throat effectively to cough out saliva from deep in the throat and therefore this could decrease test sensitivity with this collection method which should be explored although there are no studies comparing the use of saliva with throat wash in covid-19 in the previous sars-cov epidemic similar results were obtained when throat wash with 10 ml of saline and saliva were compared 10 -instead of direct spitting the use of a straw or any device that avoids the creation and expansion of drops should be encouraged the saliva of infected patients can contain viruses that may allow airborne transmission and also by oral droplets and therefore should be handled with care 14 in sars-cov it has been hypothesized that very small particles of the virus can be spread in the air 10 therefore special care should be taken during all the processes of sample collection management and analysis to eliminate this potential risk of transmission via contact with saliva droplets or aerosoltaking these facts into consideration preliminary tests should ideally be made to establish the optimal method of collection which may be different depending on the analyte to be measured for example in covid-19 it would be of interest to evaluate if the saliva obtained by clearing the throat could be more convenient for the detection of the virus whereas the whole saliva obtained directly by drool could be more suitable for the quantification of antibodies or acute phase proteinsin addition ideally the salivary flow should be controlled by establishing a fixed amount of time during which saliva is collected eg one minute it is worthwhile to indicate that the report of results should be standardized since in some cases such as for selected interleukins or alpha-amylase the way of expressing the values can influence their interpretation 4 furthermore the need for saliva sample centrifugation and the effect of this centrifugation on the analyte of interest should be assessed avoiding centrifugation can speed the sample processing allowing the use of rapid point of care tests however centrifugation helps to eliminate components that can interfere with subsequent assays 2 use of appropriate conditions for sample preservation it is known that the degradation of saliva components can occur under certain storage conditions 41 as such it is important to know the best storage conditions for samples that allow the maximum preservation of the analytes to be analyzed nevertheless while such data are lacking it is recommended to keep samples refrigerated until arrival at the lab to be analyzed and use 80 c temperatures if the samples are stored3 use of appropriate assays ideally the assays used should be sensitive enough for detecting low amounts of the analyte that can appear in saliva in this line highly sensitive immunoassays such as those based on time-resolved fluorescence or similar technologies would be recommended for immunoglobulins and acute phase proteins quantification 25 in the case of qrt-pcr it would be of importance to select an appropriate housekeeping gene and explore if the virus detected in saliva is cell-free or cell-associated overall assays should be fully validated in order to avoid analytical errors due to assay technical limitations4 increase the knowledge base on clinical applications further studies should be made to evaluate and refine the interpretation and clinical application in covid-19 of the different analytes that can be measured in saliva these studies should be focused on their use in different clinical aspects such as in diagnosis evaluation of disease severity and in monitoring the response to treatment and predict relapses as an example studies on the kinetics of antibodies in saliva compared to serum could be undertaken in some diseases a delay in the appearance of antibodies in saliva compared to serum exists and should be taken in consideration for an appropriate interpretation of the test 42saliva can have potential applications in the context of covid-19 by direct detection of the virus quantification of the specific immunoglobulins produced against it and for the evaluation of the non-specific innate immune response of the patient moreover a deeper knowledge about potential changes in the saliva proteome may allow for the identification of new diagnostic biomarkers or help to understand the mechanisms associated with the disease with the development of appropriate sample collection and processing methods and the use of adequate assays saliva can provide useful clinical information about the disease and could be potentially included in guidelines for sample collection for the diagnosis disease management and control of covid-19 antibody immunisation has been performed since the 20th century to prevent andor treat infectious diseases throughout the years its lifesaving ability has been proven in many critical cases 1 convalescent blood products cbps are obtained by collecting plasma from a patient who has recovered from a viral or bacterial infection and has developed immunity against the pathogen that caused the disease 2 when transfused cbps can neutralise viruses and bacteria thus suppressing them in the blood 3 this method was used to treat influenza a h1n1 virus and was effective in reducing h1n1 load and decreasing the mortality rate 4 ebola virus is a recent example of the successful application of cbp for patients in areas with high mortality rate 5 6similarly the use of antibodies from patients who recovered from coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 can be the main approach for the prevention and treatment of the extremely rapidly spreading virus 7 for plasma protein therapies general safety measures have been established regarding plasma collection from donors sars-cov-2 is a large virus approximately 120 nm in diameter its relatively large size and lipid envelope make it highly susceptible to viral inactivation and removal capacity steps during manufacturing processes such as solventdetergent processing 8 low-ph incubation caprylate incubation pasteurisation 9 dry-heat treatment 10 nanofiltration and fractionation 11 plasma or immunoglobulins collected from patients who recovered from a viral infection such as covid-19 have been used as a last resort to improve the survival rate of patients with the novel coronavirus whose conditions have continued to deteriorate despite treatment with pulsed methylprednisolone 12 patients treated with convalescent plasma cp demonstrate shorter hospital stay and lower mortality compared with those not treated with cp work is ongoing to test this theory on patients with covid-19 12 13 people who have recently recovered from covid-19 have antibodies to the coronavirus circulating in their blood transferring those antibodies into deteriorating patients could theoretically help boost their immunity 14 15 cp administration to patients with covid-19 improves their clinical conditions and decreases lung lesions 16 given scarce information on the biology and mode of infection of covid-19 and the virus ability to reproduce itself via mutation plasma collected from recovered patients that meet clinical criteria may offer a valuable treatment option 17 however the low number of recovered covid-19 cases and their ability and eligibility for plasma donation make the implementation of this strategy difficultthe cp of eligible donors in areas where an epidemic disease has broken out can offer specific artificially obtained passive immunity against the local infectious agent 18 plasma protein levels can readily be affected by bacterial and viral infections 19 identifying specific viral protein biomarkers is a possible strategy to identify sources and types of infection 20 regular donor screening procedures should be performed to prevent individuals that show disease symptoms generally associated with coronavirus infection including covid-19 from donating their plasma in general age gender and weight must be considered for plasma donor selection 21 specifically pooled plasma from recovered covid-19 donors for anti-covid-19 antibody therapy may undergo several general tests that can be divided into two challenging stagesthe first stage involves general plasma requirements plasma first undergoes polymerase chain reaction pcr testing to detect viral genomes covid-19 hiv hbv and hcv which should be negative 22 23 depending on the result the plasma sample could undergo viral inactivation treatments such as solventdetergent incubation which is the most commonly used method 24 25 the second stage is the evaluation of plasma suitabilityefficacy by using protein biomarkers that indicate the safetysuitability of plasma these biomarkers include serum protein and albumin concentrations of 60 and 3550 gl respectively furthermore igm and igg levels should be at least 05 gl and within 520 gl respectively 22 23 26 other infection-related proteins in plasma such as peroxiredoxin ii 27 28 and cytokines and chemokines il2 il7 il10 gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf should be at normal levels 29 30 the level of plasma c-reactive protein has been used as a marker to differentiate between severe and non-severe cases of covid-19 31 32 the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fractional inspired oxygen pao2fio2 is used to determine the level of respiratory distress 200300 for mild 100200 for moderate and below 100 as severe in patients with covid-19 33 34finding and selecting eligible donors with a sufficient amount of plasma for efficient utilisation can be challenging as convalescent subjects must meet the donor selection and general plasma requirements in the first stage furthermore the selection of the best cp to the most critical patients with covid-19 is challenging because the requirements in the second stage should be followed whilst considering blood types this process is considered a problem of multi-criteria decision-making mcdm which complies with national health requirements and known standard routine procedures 35 moreover intelligent computing issues should be investigated to propose a fully automated intelligent computing framework to solve these complex challengesa fully automated intelligent computing solution framework for the abovementioned challenges can be established by following critical reviews related to intelligent computing issues on the basis of two directions namely classification of blood types and prioritisation in the medical sectorfirstly blood type classification is crucial for medical procedures such as blood transfusions before conducting medical procedures a wide range of compatibility tests called pre-transfusion tests must be conducted 36 however time is often limited in case of emergencies preventing these experiments to be performed using commercial systems available in laboratories this scenario might result in transfusion reactions which may worsen the condition of patients or lead to death 37 other manual alternatives allow blood type determination however these procedures require a laboratory technician to intervene and are susceptible to human error during either testing or reading and interpreting findings which are not acceptable in crucial cases 38 in these cases pre-transfusion tests are often appropriate even in emergency situations and compatible blood should be administered to eradicate blood incompatibilities furthermore the universal blood type for donors is not too infrequent research efforts on classifying blood types in these cases are scarcethe author of 38 developed a prototype for the rapid determination of blood pre-transfusion tests in emergency situations this prototype is portable effective and affordable can be used even in remote locations and undeveloped countries it has been used in remote areas ambulances far-off accident sites and areas struck by natural disasters eg tornados earthquakes tsunamis and wars another author 39 discussed the importance of classifying blood type by presenting an image processing-based methodology that allows the rapid ie 2 min and safe determination of a patients blood type for use in emergency cases they effectively utilised their methodology and verified its capability to safely and rapidly identify blood types for use in emergencies 40 the blood types can be determined using their techniques by plate tests and the analysis can be carried out automatically furthermore they discussed that image processing methods can enable automatic identification with fast and accurate blood type results the use of such approach would eliminate errors committed by technicians in blood typing leading to safe blood transfusions and reducing the loss of human lives 41authors 42 introduced a prototype for pre-transfusion testing that was designed exclusively for use in emergencies the prototype is unique in its portability effectiveness and timely results the latest version of the prototype introduced significant improvements concerning various factors such as size optimised plate test high autonomy light weight and reduced execution time for procedures these research efforts clearly indicate that blood type determination is not a new topic and should be performed rapidly and efficiently without producing errors in dangerous situations given the recent spread of covid-19 hospitals are filled with numerous patients who are either improving from the viral infection or getting worse dying however plasma from those who recovered can be used to assist those who have not recovered depending on their severity in this case blood type classification should be performed with maximum speed and efficiency to save as many lives as possible the role of intelligent technologies such as machine learning ml methods eg naive bayes nearest neighbour support vector machines and decision trees and deep learning methods eg deep artificial convolutional and recurrent neural networks would help the classification process the management of such patients and in deciding donor plasma prioritisationsecondly patient prioritisation in the medical sector is conducted to provide health careservices for each patient in due course on the basis of the severity of patient condition rescuers determine and provide suitable healthcare services depending on patient priority 43 in an emergency the highest and lowest priorities should be given to patients with the most and least emergent case respectively compared with other patients in the healthcare system improper patient prioritisation can lead to incorrect strategic decisions that can endanger patients lives 44 several medical informatics studies have presented a prioritisation solution for patients with single 45 46 47 48 and multiple chronic heart diseases 49 50 51furthermore the healthcare sector is affected by numerous patients with covid-19 and needs an urgent solution to avert the risk of deteriorating patients in terms of their prioritisation according to their critical health conditions a study 52 proposed a methodology to select situations with risky health conditions and prioritise patients depending on laboratory examination results this process is highly complex especially when a decision rule based on multi-biological requirements is followed thereby introducing another challenge 53 the exact situation for all infected patients should be understood on the basis of all criteria in this case patients infected with covid-19 should be prioritised in order to administer appropriate treatments from critical to mild situations 54 this process enables infectious disease specialists to differentiate patient levels and detect optimal asymptomatic carriers amongst other critical patients 55 56no study has presented a distinct and successive prioritisation solution for patients with covid-19 and cp recipients nor provided an appropriate health caretreatment based on their priority situation three specific issues of the prioritisation of patients with covid-19 and cps are described as follows firstly the prioritisation is dependent on important attributes thus patient and cp selection based on multiple criteria is a multi-attribute decision matrix 57 58 59 60 61 secondly different values of importance are often given for each attribute which further increases the complexity of the task 63 64 65 66 67 finally a prioritisation process requires synchronised consideration of the inverse relationship amongst the mentioned criteria thus a trade-off is created 49 68 122 in this context decision-making methods are essential to overcome the abovementioned challenges by prioritising infected patients with covid-19 and cpsmcdm is an extension of decision theory covering any multi-objective decision and can solve this problem by constructing a decision matrix based on an intersection between the evaluation criteria used and patients with covid-19 andor a list of tested cps in general the main target of mcdm is to rankprioritise a set of alternatives on the basis of different evaluation criteria 63 69 70 71 72 73 74to the best of our knowledge no study has covered the challenges and issues in terms of biological requirements and intelligent computing on automation framework thus a transfusion framework should be proposed to help doctors hasten treatments the framework should include general plasma requirements a minimum of two viral reduction steps and the use of protein biomarkers to indicate the safety and suitability of plasma furthermore the framework should include a process for selecting patients with the most critical emergency condition and the best cp on the basis of biomarker criteria whilst utilising mcdm methods these methods should be used to weigh the evaluation criteria and prioritise covid-19 plasma on the basis of blood types in such case transfusion can be achieved from donor to patient on the basis of patients critical health conditions and priorityplasma protein levels can readily be affected by bacterial and viral infections 19 however specific viral protein biomarkers can be used to identify the source and type of infections 20 standard donor screening procedures should be followed to avoid plasma donations from people that display clinical symptoms typically linked to coronavirus infection including covid-19 in general pooled plasma from recovered covid-19 donors for anti-covid-19 antibody therapy should undergo a two-stage abo compatibility test figure 1 pre-transfusion testing is essential before blood transfusion from donors to patients the detection of agglutination in blood samples and the correct determination of blood type through ml methods are effective patient classification at this phase can be performed using several approaches based on image acquisition processing and ml methods through these different classifiers accurate blood type results can be achieved this classifier will manage donors at the start of the process figure 1 and classify them on the basis of their blood types the list of donors who had their plasma tested for blood typing and who were successful in the test stages and collected in repository 1 should be determined and show beneficial results on further steps figure 2 practical steps will be explained in detail in the development phasethe first stage explains the general plasma requirements and the following viral reduction steps 1 pcr is used to detect viral genomes eg covid-19 hiv hbv hcv which should be negative alternatively other methods approved by local medical authorities can be used 22 23 2 viral inactivationfractionation treatments such as solventdetergent incubation are used 3 viral heat deactivation or filtration is also usedthe second stage involves the use of the following protein biomarkers to indicate the safety and suitability of plasma 1 total serum protein concentration of 60 gl 2 albumin concentration within 3550 gl 3 minimum igm and igg level of 05 and within 520 gl respectively 22 23 26 4 normal plasma peroxiredoxin ii level relative to that of a non-infected individual given that a high 28 or low 27 level may indicate that a plasma is unsuitable for donationtherapy 5 normal plasma level of cytokines and chemokines elevated levels of il2 il7 il10 gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf indicate severe lung inflammation 29 30 and 6 plasma c-reactive protein can differentiate severe from non-severe cases the c-reactive protein is highly elevated in severe covid-19 cases 31 32the outcome of stage 1 is that either a patient is registered in repository 2 due to positive hcv test or referred to stage 2 due to negative hcv test stage 2 begins by testing for anti-covid-19 antibodiesbiomarkers the outcome of stage 2 involves two repositories repository 3 is considered for non-eligible donors the most important repository is 1 wherein a donor has passed the tests related to this stage this repository will involve a useful cp that can be used for further processing figure 2in this step the test results of collected blood samples will be converted into images for use in the next stage which is preprocessing 78 80 81 a persons blood type is determined by applying antigens a b and d to the persons blood samples these antigens may or may not match with red blood cell antibodies to a particular blood group the technician detects clumps of blood cells after antigens are applied to the blood samples for example if clumps in samples with antigens a and d are detected then the blood group is defined as a if the clumps are only found in samples applied with antigen a then the group is marked as a likewise if clumps are produced in blood samples applied with antigens b and d then the group is known as b if no clumping occurs in blood samples added with any of the antigens then the group is known as o 42in this step the collected sample images must be aligned to one image containing three centred blood tests to preprocess the dataset and prepare it for ml the image is a 30  90-pixel rectangle afterwards the label should be changed from categorical to numerical the dataset will be loaded to python the data arrays are reshaped to provide a single-colour display and the collected images should be converted from rgb to greyscale eight groups are defined as specific integer groups one hot encoding is performed to convert the integers into eight binary vector elements with 1 for a class value index and 0 for all other classes accordingly for ml to understand our dataset the pixel values of each image in the dataset should be prepared as unsigned integers in the range between black and white or 0 and 255 the pixel values of greyscale images are then normalised eg rescale them to the range 01 this step first involves the conversion of the data form to floats from unsigned integers and then the division of the pixel values by a maximum value of 255 moreover the dataset will be divided into three sets namely training set with 70 of the total size validation set with 15 of the total size and test set with 15 of the total size the training set will be used to train via ml the validation set will be used to validate the training in every epoch lastly the test set will be used to evaluate the model after being trained the next step will involve using these sets to train via mlthis step includes building learning methods as previously explained the dataset is loaded into python and then separated into training testing and validation sets which will be used for learning training validation of the model and evaluation of learning respectively 82 after training and testing the learning will be used to classify new blood test samples a good result will then be obtained by the ml classifier in image processing thus each of the tests will establish whether or not sample agglutination has occurredthis step uses the trained saved model in step three and then preprocesses the new image samples as in phase two except for labelling which will be predicted using our trained ml method to classify the new blood test results on new images the trained learning method will be used as a classifier method which assumes that new images are greyscale and arranged in a manner wherein one picture contains three oriented blood tests antigens a b and d the picture is a 30  90-pixel rectanglea set of alternatives ie patients with covid-19 can be prioritised to transfuse cp to the most severe patients who cannot safely wait at this stage the patients will be prioritised on the basis of six serologicalprotein biomarkers and pao2fio2 criteria ie albumin igmigg cytokinechemokines peroxiredoxin ii c-reactive protein pao2fio2 in this case the patient decision matrix is constructed on the basis of an intersection between serologicalprotein biomarker and pao2fio2 criteria and patients with covid-19 table 1
as shown in figure 2 patient side the proposed patient decision matrix can be used to prioritise all patients with covid-19 and identify the most critical patients that immediately require a compatible cp from donors before proceeding with a detailed explanation of cp transfusion to prioritised covid-19 patients we should explain the process of cpblood donation from a medical perspective 38 cpblood donation can be performed as follows1volunteer class a can donate cpblood to patient class a or b2volunteer class b can donate cpblood to patient class b or ab3volunteer class ab can donate cpblood only to patient class ab4volunteer class o can donate cpblood to all patients classes ie a b ab o
on this basis the most critical patient with covid-19 has been prioritised and the results from the mentioned patient decision matrix should also be classified for blood type identification moreover as shown in figure 2 donor side the donors are classified into the four blood types now we assume that we have obtained five cps of class o five patients with covid-19 of class a and five patients of class b the patient decision matrix is used and prioritises patients on the basis of their emergency conditions for example if patient 1 under class a is considered as the most critical and severe patient with covid-19 then heshe immediately requires a suitable cp an important question is who is the most appropriate volunteer five cps under class o that can donate cp for this critical patient patient class a a cp decision matrix table 2
 should be provided to prioritise and identify the most suitable volunteer that can provide an appropriate cp for the patient under class ain line with the patient decision matrix the cp decision matrix is constructed on the basis of an intersection between the serologicalprotein biomarker criteria and the list of cps tested an overall evaluation criterion can be recognised under two categories namely benefit and cost the benefit criterion implies that a high value is better but the cost criterion implies the opposite 49 83 84 85 in this study from a medical perspective albumin igmigg and pao2fio2 levels are considered the benefit criteria whereas cytokinechemokine peroxiredoxin ii and c-reactive protein levels are considered the cost criteria in summary the mentioned decision matrices ie patients and cp decision matrices have been proposed to identify the most suitable cp within each class donor side for corresponding prioritised patients with covid-19 patient side however on the basis of the constructed decision matrices three prioritisation issues have been generated ie multi-criteria important criteria and trade-off amongst the criteria the prioritisation of patients with covid-19 andor cps regarding multi-criteria ie serologicalprotein biomarker andor pao2fio2 criteria is challenging because of the following issuesfirstly the patients should be prioritised on the basis of the severity of covid-19 and the suitability of each cp should be evaluated on the basis of their value within each criterion secondly different weights can be assigned for the mentioned criteria by decision-makers ie specialists andor based on objective calculations which further increases the complexity of the task thirdly three criteria of serologicalprotein biomarkers andor pao2fio2 are considered benefit criteria whereas the rest are considered cost criteria thus the inverse relationship between serologicalprotein biomarker andor pao2fio2 criteria produces a trade-off the prioritisation of patients with covid-19 andor cps is a complex mcdm problem the development of decision-making methods is important to preclude the prioritisation problem complexity 86 87 88 89this section proposes an mcdm approach with two important purposes firstly weights are assigned to the serologicalprotein biomarker and pao2fio2 criteria used in the prioritisation of cps and covid-19 patients this stage aims to solve the issue of importance by investigating the most effectively used serologicalprotein biomarker and pao2fio2 criteria for prioritisation secondly cps and patients with covid-19 are prioritised on the basis of weighted criteria resulting from the first stage this stage aims to eliminate two critical issues ie multi-criteria and trade-off issues through ranking alternatives ie cps andor covid-19 patients furthermore many mcdm techniques are generally developed and used for weighting the evaluation criteria alternative ranking or both alternative methods are ranked to determine the best approach 90 91 such techniques include weighted sum model 92 multiplicative exponential weighting 93 weighted product method 94 hierarchical adaptive weighting 95 simple additive weighting 96 technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution 97 vlsekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje 98 analytic hierarchy process ahp 99 novel technique for the reorganisation of opinion order to interval levels trooil 49 and preference selection index psi 100 the major drawbacks of all of these methods except for ahp trooil and psi include the absence of weight generation provision 101 102 103literature reviews have incorporated external weighting approaches to boost the efficiency of the original ranking strategies by generating the importance of many criteria in relation to the goal to avoid the abovementioned limitations 104 105 121 criterion weighting strategies allocate weights to attributes that are relatively important to one another 106 107 however weighting the evaluation criteria comprises two aspects the first aspect indicates the importance of each criterion by conducting a pairwise comparison between the criteria set which is called criterion weight 108 the second aspect indicates that the importance of the criterion values is identified by the comparison process between the values of each criterion which is called criterion value weight for example the pao2fio2 ratio is the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen it is a widely used clinical indicator of hypoxemia and can determine the level of respiratory distress in patients with covid-19 its weight of criterion value does not depend on the highest or lowest value but rather on the normal level of respiratory distress 200300 as mild 100200 as moderate and below 100 as severe in such cases the pairwise comparison would be between the values of the pao2fio2 criterion to specify the accepted value that the physicianmedical staff considers as normal which is called the value of the criteriain general objective and subjective assessment methods have been developed to identify criterion weights the objective methods use each criterion information to identify the criterion weight such techniques include entropy and criterion importance through intercriterion correlation 109 110 111 these techniques do not rely on a decision-makers subjective judgment in weight assignment 112 weight is typically allocated directly to attributes via a mathematical method 113 these techniques are widely used in previous works and no inconsistency problem has been generated however subjective weight is the most significant in evaluating findings as it reflects the views and experiences of highly qualified experts 114 when there is a need to assign weights for criteria subjectively these approaches cannot incorporate decision-makers knowledge and subjective value into one decision which is the drawback of these techniquessubjective assessment provides weight to attributes on the basis of decision-makers perceptions and subjective significance to each attribute subjective weights represent cumulative decision-makers experience and subjective judgment in current decision-making scenarios 115 examples of these techniques are ahp and bestworst method bwm 116 ahp is one of the most common methods used in multi-criteria decision-making ahp depends on human preference 117 this method was developed by thomas l saaty despite its popularity the method has a major drawback of inconsistency during criterion weighting in ahp the calculated priorities are plausible only if the pairwise comparison matrices have passed the consistency test furthermore many decision problems cannot be structured hierarchically when the interaction of higher-level elements with lower-level elements and their dependency should be considered in bwm the weights of criteria are generated on the basis of pairwise comparisons between the set of criteria 107 bwm is a new and important mcdm method that requires less pairwise comparisons than ahp it derives the weights of criteria with high consistency bwm was proposed by rezaei in 2015 it can determine the weights of criteria on the basis of pairwise comparisons with a small number of comparisons ie 2n-3 where n is the number of criteria furthermore bwm is better than ahp in terms of consistency bwm executes reference comparisons indicating that it only needs to determine the preference of the best criterion over all other criteria and the preference of all criteria over the worst criterion 61the benefits of few comparisons are the absence of the need to use fractional numbers and easier understanding by decision-makers experts compared with most mcdm methods bwm utilises a 19 scale to perform pairwise comparisons as mentioned above bwm successfully reduces pairwise comparison from nn    12 in ahp to 2n    3 in bwm similar to ahp this method suffers from two issues namely the difficulty to determine the best and worst criteria and importance level of the best criterion over other criteria and the importance of all criteria over the worst criterion in general when the comparison uses a 19 scale the decision-maker needs to state how many times a particular criterion is better than the other criteria this comparison requires high cognitive power due to the unusual subjective comparisons thus comparing two uncorrelated criteria is not a natural process and is difficult to achieveon the basis of viewpoints in the above discussion the objective weighting approach computes the weight of the criteria without an inconsistency issue however it neglects human opinion which is vital in making a proper decision by contrast the subjective weighting approach identifies the importance of criteria by computing the weight of each criterion however it faces an inconsistency issue both directions ignore the importance of the criterion value which is essential in making correct and accurate rankings and selections therefore to address the issues discussed above this study proposes sodosm a novel mcdm method this method can acquire the relative importance of various criteria with their values within cp and patient decision matrices objectively and subjectively without any inconsistency issue and provides a ranking for alternative cpspatientsthe proposed sodosm behaviour comparison is conducted amongst each criterion within the cp decision matrix ie albumin igmigg cytokinechemokines peroxiredoxin ii and c-reactive protein and patient decision matrix ie albumin igmigg cytokinechemokines peroxiredoxin ii c-reactive protein and pao2fio2 per alternative cppatient to identify the worst solutions this method can be divided into four steps namely data input data transformation linguistic data scale conversion and computation of the importance of criteria and ranking alternatives as shown in figure 4
 in sodosm an expert selects the worst value for each criterion and performs a reference comparison between the worst and the other values in the same criterion an opinion matrix is then created the opinion matrix is converted into equivalent likert scale numbers table 3
 the importance of any criterion is determined using objective weight lastly a compromise technique is applied to achieve the final rank of alternative cpspatientsa
data input unit

the evaluation criteria are identified and a scheme that relays goals is created evolving alternative schemes are used to reach the goals alternative patients andor cps are estimated in relation to the criteria of cp decision matrix ie albumin igmigg cytokinechemokines peroxiredoxin ii and c-reactive protein and the criteria of patient decision matrix ie albumin igmigg cytokinechemokines peroxiredoxin ii c-reactive protein and pao2fio2 the decision matrix r is then created as follows1c1c2cnra1a2amv11v12v21v22v1nv2nvm1vm2vmn
a
data transformation

upon the development of both decision matrices the output of step a the decision-makers ie specialist must select the worst solution from each decision matrix r for either cps or patients the worst solution is defined by three values namely max min and critical values2aworstsolutionmaxivijminjvijopijvijiji123mwhere maxi represents the benefit criteria ie albumin igmigg and pao2fio2 amongst alternatives and minj represents the cost criteria cytokinechemokines peroxiredoxin ii and c-reactive protein amongst alternatives these values are utilised to specify the worst solution relative to the benefit or cost criteria opij is the critical value of a worst solution but is neither a max value nor a min value i and j represent the benefit and cost criteria respectively this step identifies the worst solution that is limited to the maximum and minimum on the basis of the benefit and cost criteria hence the specialist has the flexibility to choose the worst outcome after selecting the outcome the worst solution and criteria per alternative are then compared figure 5
this step identifies distance measurements to the worst solution by applying the euclidian distance of the actual values to the worst solution the distance between the worst solution and alternative cps andor patients with covid-19 is measured subjectively specialists are requested to assess if the criterion per alternative and the worst solution are significantly different the comparison between the worst solution and criteria per alternative changes with the value of the linguistic term five scales are used in the comparison with the following linguistic terms no differences slight differences evident differences big differences and huge differences values v11 v32 v43 and v54 are nominated by specialists as the worst solution vector by using equation 2 following the worst solution selection step the worst solution and alternatives are compared using equation 33oplangvijvijjji123mwhere  represents the reference comparison between the worst solution and alternatives ie cps andor patients with covid-19 the operator  uses the scale this comparison is performed only for one column of decision matrix r figure 6
 other columns use the same procedure to change the value of the linguistic termthe specialist completes the comparison and then obtains opinion decision matrices ie cps andor patients with covid-19 by changing the value of each criterion with the specific comparison of the linguistic term expressed in equation 4 and demonstrated in figure 7
 the final output of this block is the linguistic term opinion decision matrices ie cps andor patients with covid-19 that can be readily transformed into a five-point likert scale to obtain a numerical opinion specialist furthermore the problem of finding the weight of criterion value is solved by finding the weight implicit with the difference of achievement per criteria to the worst solution4oplanga1amop11op1nopm1opmn
a
convert the likert linguistic scale into equivalent scale number

in this study each recorded response made by an expert in the form of a likert linguistic scale is converted into an equivalent scale number table 3the outcome of this step produces converted-opinion decision matrices ie cps andor patients with covid-19 which have values without any unit and with the same scalea
weighting criteria and ranking alternatives

the criterion weights are calculated objectively by an entropy process based on the measurement of uncertain data provided in both decision matrices ie cps andor patients with covid-19 this process immediately produces weights for a particular criterion on the basis of a reciprocal contrast between different criteria of variants for each criterion and then all of the criteria simultaneously objective criterion weights wj are determined according to the entropy procedure in three steps
calculation of information entropy

information entropy is an important element for calculating criterion weight high information entropy indicates that the information supplied by the criteria is increasing and that the weight is large the information entropy ei is measured using equation 55eji1mfijlnfijlnmi12nwhere6fijriji1mrijand0ej1
if fij values are equal then the entropy values of each criterion are maximum ei  1 if fij is 0 then fij ln fij is 0 118
computation of weight vector the weight of individual criterion wj is calculated by the entropy process after calculating the information entropy equation 7 expresses the significance of the criteria in the proposed method7wj1ejni1mejwherej1nwj1
where n is the number of criteria used in this step entropy process is employed on the alternative ie patients andor cps values per criterion to find the criterion weightcomputation of the rank of alternatives ie patients and cps
after the criteria are weighted objectively by the entropy process each criterion function is evaluated and the measure of closeness is compared with the ideal solution the compromise solution is the practical alternative that is nearest to the ideal solution and has a mutually concessional compromise 119 patientscps will be prioritised via the following steps
step i weighted decision matrices ie cps andor covid-19 patients are defined as wm  wmijmxn by applying equation 88wmj1nrijwj

step ii d and d are identified where d is the maximum achievement for all alternatives ie cps andor covid-19 patients in the wm per criteria and d is the minimum achievement for all alternatives ie cps andor covid-19 patients in the wm per criteria these values are determined using equations 10 and 11 respectively9dmaxjdij

step iii
s and r are measured where s is the summation the patientcp values and r is the maximum value in those alternatives by using equations 121411cjddijdd

step iv the final rank score q is measured using equation 1514qvsisss1vrirrrwhere v is introduced for the strategy of maximum group utility and 1  v is the weight of the individual regret the value for v is 05 however any v value can be assigned to the 01 range s
max si smin si r
max ri and rmin ri the patientscps with the lowest q value are the best alternatives
step v the patientscps are ranked in ascending order by sorting the results from q finally the set of alternatives cpspatients is ranked by their score in ascending order a low mean value indicates a high priority rankthe limitation of this study is that the proposed framework has not been tested on infected cases due to the lockdown and global pandemic outbreak collecting real datasets of patients with covid-19 and donors who have already recovered is difficultthe covid-19 pandemic has caused an unmatched human and health crisis 120 the virus can be eliminated by improving the healthcare quality of patients with covid-19 and providing them with protective antibodies from the blood of patients who have recovered from this disease this procedure could theoretically help boost the immunity of infected patients to help doctors accelerate treatments this study presents an intelligent rescue framework for the transfusion of appropriate tested cps to the most severe covid-19 cases on the basis of biological requirements a detailed description of the proposed framework has been discussed sequentially in two phases moreover several mcdm methods have been debated and analysed in terms of their capability in the adoption these methods are utilised in the proposed framework however given their limitations a novel mcdm method called sodosm is proposed to assign the comparative importance for the criteria used in both decision matrices proposed ie cps and patients with covid-19 and then prioritise cpspatients effectively this study presents seven recommendations for future work firstly the proposed framework will be implemented and tested to serve and help the healthcare sector in fighting the sars-cov-2 virus by improving the immunity of infected patients secondly the proposed framework can be used with any future generation of coronaviruses or other new viruses to rescue the newly infected patients based on the drawn strategies of this framework thirdly big data life cycle stages ie collection of data cleaning of data classification of data modelling and its delivery of the prioritisation process for donors and patients with covid-19 will be discussed in detail fourthly the possibility of adoption of the internet of things in the prioritisation process of covid-19 patients will be investigated fifthly the proposed framework can be run and performed in the indooroutdoor hospitals over a telemedicine environment to rescue a huge number of patients widely such a process can be provided in two different architectures namely centralised telemedicine based on data centre and decentralised telemedicine based on blockchain technology in this line the privacy and security of patientsdonors information will be provided in addition to the network security of telemedicine architectures sixthly the proposed framework can be helped the administrative divisions of the healthcare organisation make the correct judgmentdecision in choosing a proper ml hierarchical andor multilabelled classification method for covid-19 on the basis of the proposed sodosm method seventhly if needed the proposed sodosm can be extended to fuzzy andor rough environments to manage uncertainty and ambiguous problems

nonein december 2019 a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 began to spread around the globe the disease caused by the virus was named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 it has been demonstrated that the virus can spread through respiratory droplets aerosols and other abiotic material surface contacts ong et al 2020 van doremalen et al 2020 the virus may also be transmitted by the fecal route since live virus has been detected in feces wang et al 2020b more critically asymptomatic infections and transmissions have been shown to occur hoehl et al 2020 yu et al 2020c hence there is an urgent need to develop sensitive accurate rapid and low-cost diagnostic tools to screen infected individuals so that proper isolation and treatment can be facilitatedcurrently there are three types of covid-19 diagnostics methods 1 chest ct scan combine with clinical symptoms 2 rt-qpcr based ribonucleic acid rna detection 3 lateral flow immunochromatographic strip lfics fully automatic chemiluminescence assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa based antibody detection however conducting ct scan is limited to larger central hospitals normal clinics and test laboratories do not have access to the ct scan moreover ct scan can neither distinguish different viruses nor identify specific viruses on the other hand the rt-qpcr method requires 13 days to report results usually the experiment time is about 4 h and has a high false-negative rate individuals who initially test false-negative contribute greatly to the further spread of the virus and prevent proper control of infection meanwhile detection methods that target the antibody are not suitable for screening of early and asymptomatic cases as most patients had an antibody response at about 10 days after onset of symptoms it is furthermore easy to generate a false positive result due to interference from other proteins in human blood or serum samples now they can only be used with rt-qpcr to increase the sensitivity and specificity of covid-19 diagnosisin addition to the limitations of detection techniques and methods there are many factors that can affect test results such as the choice of biomarkers the taking of clinical specimens etc in this review biomarkers other biochemical indicators and specimens are comprehensively analyzed and discussed diagnostic cases of ct scan various rna detection methods and antibody detection methods are also summarized and discussed more interestingly ai assisted diagnosis and potential ultrasensitive biosensor are emphasized a comprehensive schematic diagram of current diagnostic methods and potential portable biosensors for covid-2019 is presented in fig 1
the positive-sense single-stranded rna genome of sars-cov-2 contains 30 kilobases in size and encodes 9860 amino acids it is the most important biomarker for diagnosis of covid-19 usually the preferred targets for rt-qpcr assays included the conserved andor abundantly expressed genes such as the structural spike glycoprotein gene s gene envelop protein gene e genes and nucleocapsid protein gene n genes and the non-structural rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and replicase open reading frame 1ab orf1ab genes chu et al 2020 corman et al 2020 designed primers targeting these genes are demonstrated to be specific and sensitive for the novel sars-cov-2 and ruled out most of the other coronaviruses mers oc43 and 229e and influenza viruses h1n1 h3n2 h5n1 etc won et al 2020 among them orf1ab and e genes are mostly reported pan et al 2020 sars-cov-2 shares about 79 whole-genome sequence identity with sars-cov lu et al 2020d wang et al 2020a hence design of the unique primers or guide rnas grnas are needed park and coworkers designed two primer set for sars-cov-2 specific region which does not exist in sars-cov park et al 2020a a unique n gene grna was designed to distinguish sars-cov-2 with no cross-reactivity for sars-cov broughton et al 2020a a study from lim and coworkers points out that targeting the n gene is more sensitive than targeting the rdrp gene by 7-43 fold kim et al 2020b besides this three novel rt-qpcr assays targeting the rdrphelicase hel s and n genes of sars-cov-2 were developed and compared chan et al 2020 the detection of rdrphel shows excellent sensitivity using nasopharyngeal aspirates as specimens and it does not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens in cell culture and clinical specimens whereas the rdrp-p2 assay cross-reacted with sars-cov in cell culture the novel assay may be especially useful for detecting covid-19 cases with low viral loads and when testing upper respiratory tract saliva and plasma specimens of patientsthe whole virus sars-cov-2 and their structural proteins including the spike s glycoprotein small envelope e protein matrix m protein nucleocapsid n protein and also several accessory proteins can theoretically be used as antigens for covid-19 diagnosis fig 2
 it is predicted that the sars-cov-2 has 28 proteins wu et al 2020 the particle size of the whole virus ranges from 50 to 200 nm kim et al 2020a ramphul and mejias 2020 according to previous reports the m and e proteins are necessary for virus assembly neuman et al 2011 nieto-torres et al 2014 the s protein is critical for adhering to host cells where the receptor-binding domain rbd of s protein mediates the interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 zhou et al 2020b s and n proteins may be the most valuable antigen biomarkers for diagnosis of covid-19 just like many detection methods have been reported for diagnosing sars based on s and n proteins che et al 2004 woo et al 2005 a proteome microarray with 18 out of the 28 predicted proteins was fabricated and used to investigate the antibody responses the results show that the patients at the convalescent phase have 100 antibody responses to the proteome especially to protein n s1 orf9b and nsp5 jiang et al 2020 recently lee gehrkes group prepared to submit a lateral flow-based covid-19 diagnostic technology to the united states food and drug administration fda for emergency use authorization the detection targets are viral proteins this technology appears in and is supported by their previously published work for dengue yellow fever and ebola viruses yen et al 2015 our previous work discussed the molecularly imprinted polymers mips and surface imprinted polymers sips based electrochemical biosensor for virus antigen detection cui et al 2020 however there are still few published articles for detection of the whole sars-cov-2 virus or their antigensdetection of specific antibodies directed to sars-cov-2 in patient blood is another choice for diagnosis of covid-19 it is widely accepted that immunoglobulin m igm provides the first line of defense during viral infections prior to the generation of adaptive high affinity immunoglobulin g igg responses which are responsible for immunological memory and long-term immunity to et al 2020a zhang et al demonstrated that both igm and igg can be detected after 5 days of onset caused by anti-sars-cov-2 by elisa assay zhang et al 2020b a study conducted by pan and coworkers shows that the sensitivity of colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic assay with igm and igg combinatorial detection in nuclear acid confirmed cases were 111 929 and 968 at the early stage 17 days after onset intermediate stage 814 days after onset and late stage more than 15 days respectively pan et al 2020 for sars infections the igm antibody could be detected in patients blood after 36 days and igg could be detected after 8 days lee et al 2010 wan et al 2003 therefore detection technology targeting antibodies is not suitable for screening early covid-19 cases it is more helpful for the convalescent phase cases in addition the detection of antibody level is correlated with virus neutralisation titre which is especially important for the design of vaccines to et al 2020ain the clinical laboratory many samples or biomarkers can be tested such as blood routine urine routine infectious index hemagglutination index blood gas analysis indicators and cytokine indicators when the patients with symptoms can not be confirmed by rt-qpcr tests the discovery of other biomarkers or indexes is very important it can assist the clinical diagnosis in avoiding delays in isolation and treatment ai technology can easily process large sample studies and effectively reduce man-made deletion which can improve the accuracy of diagnosis and prediction 174 patients characteristics were comprehensively analyzed by four types of algorithms peng et al 2020 and the 18 most important diagnostic factors which are significantly related to positive covid-19 diagnosis were revealed among them white blood cell count wbc eosinophil count eosinophil ratio 2019 new coronavirus rna 2019n-cov and serum amyloid a saa have the greatest clinical significance some cytokines were also be tested and analyzed and the results showed their levels are abnormal but the linkage to sarsmers is not so significant however another study shows that the level of interleukin-6 il-6 il-10 il-2 and interferons- ifn- in the peripheral blood of the severe cases increased compared to those in the mild cases the degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe covid-19 patients than in mild cases it is associated with the disease severity liu et al 2020a wang et al 2020c hence they can be indicators of prognosis for severe covid-19 biomarkers or indicators for diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19 are listed in the table 1
see table 3table 3specimens are highly related to detection efficiency and accuracy now specimens from the upper respiratory tract contain throat nasal deep throat saliva lower respiratory tract contain sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid feces fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy and blood are being investigated for the rt-qpcr based rna detection specimens from the lower respiratory tract induce a relatively less false-negative rate for the upper respiratory tract specimens the nasal specimen has higher viral loads than that of the throat zou et al 2020 although the nasopharyngeal or throat swabs are feasible for diagnosis the sampling process can make the patient or suspected case uncomfortable and induce coughing and sneezing which generates aerosol and creates a potential health hazard for medical staff another study reveals that sputum swabs 769 showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs 442 p  0001 lin et al 2020 because most patients have no sputum sputum-inducing methods were used and studied in two cases han et al 2020 the results demonstrated that sputum induction is more helpful than throat swabs for the detection of sars-cov-2 rna in convalescent patients for the health care workers sputum induction is a simple safe and non-invasive way for detecting many lung diseases fahy 1998 besides the respiratory tract fecal specimens also have a similar diagnostic accuracy to pharyngeal swabs zhang et al 2020atimepoints of viral load study are important for choice of specimens the viral load of sars-cov-2 is similar to that of influenza which peaks occur shortly within 3 days after symptom onset in contrast to that of sars-cov and mers-cov which have peaks at around 10 and 14 days respectively hayden et al 1999 oh et al 2016 peiris et al 2003 zou et al 2020 comparisons of viral loads or positive rates for different specimens are listed in table 2in conclusion deep throat saliva and induced sputum are desired for rt-qpcr tests however developing methods which allow the patient to collect the samples by themselves are more desirableenvironmental contamination as a route of transmission bin et al 2016 must be considered stability of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in aerosols and on different surfaces such as plastic stainless steel copper and cardboard are currently being investigated van doremalen et al 2020 sars-cov-2 remained viable in aerosols for 3 h sars-cov-2 is more stable on plastic and stainless steel surfaces than on copper and cardboard as viable viruses were detected up to 72 h after application to these surfaces developing biosensors for on-site environmental sars-cov-2 detection and long-term monitoring is urgently neededa chest ct scan combines a series of x-ray images taken from different angles around the chest and uses computer processing to create cross-sectional images slices of the lung the diagnosis of covid-19 based on the radiologic features has been defined as a diagnostic criteria bai et al 2020b li and xia 2020 zhou et al 2020c however ct scan is an experience-dependent diagnostic technique and requires large medical equipment it can only be used in some central hospitals whats more ct scan is limited in terms of distinguishing different viruses and identifying specific viruses it doesnt work for asymptomatic pre-symptomatic infections and even some mild symptomatic individuals without pneumonia every chest ct image needs to be read first by one radiologist and then needs to be checked by another radiologist recently a 3d deep learning framework for the diagnosis of covid-19 based on chest ct images was developed li et al 2020a the results showed that the reported model achieved a sensitivity of 90 and specificity of 96 the auc area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values for covid-19 and community acquired pneumonia cap were 096 and 095 respectively it shows great potential as an automatic ct diagnostic toolquantitative rt-qpcr is routinely used to detect the viruses and has been widely used by center for disease control and prevention and other relevant departments worldwide won et al 2020 however the currently available rt-qpcr kits offering sensitivities ranging between 45 and 60 repeat testing may be required to make a definite diagnosis the inconsistency and fnr of rt-qpcr can be attributed to many different factors including the variation that occurs in viral rna sequences which subsequently affects results that use primers in the orf1ab gene and n genes the influence of variation in viral rna sequences can be minimized by the mismatch-tolerant amplification methods li et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 which would be very helpful for improving the sensitivity and reliability of rna detection another factor that thwarts the accuracy and consistency of rt-qpcr tests is sampling procedures since the viral loads varies in different anatomic sites the fnr was as high as 3050 from one-time testing in real covid-19 cases wang et al 2020c to overcome the time-consuming and difficult operation of rna extraction zhao and coworkers developed a carboxyl groups pc-coated magnetic nanoparticles pcmnps for viral rna extraction compared with traditional column-based nucleic acids extraction methods 2 h the pcmnps-based method 30 min combines the virus lysis and rna binding into one step and the pcmnps-rna complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent rt-pcr reactions it results in 10-copy sensitivity and the high linearity over 5 logs of gradient in sars-cov-2 viral rna detection zhao et al 2020bdigital pcr dpcr technology can significantly improve the sensitivity and accuracy of covid-19 diagnosis the limit of detection lod of the optimized dpcr is at least 10-fold lower than that of rt-qpcr lu et al 2020a the overall sensitivity specificity and accuracy of rt-dpcr protocol for rna detection were 90 100 and 93 respectively zhou et al 2020ato overcome the obstacle of rt-qpcrs time-consuming and costliness but still be able to detect pathogens nucleic acid loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp-based method are developed lu et al 2020b yu et al 2020a it provides nucleic acid amplification in a short time by using a dna polymerase with chain displacement activity and 46 specially designed primers under a constant temperature of 6065 c tanner et al 2015 teoh et al 2013 it has potential to be applied for point-of-care test poct lu et al 2020c moreover unpurified samples could be detected directly using lamp park et al 2020a this indicates that high-throughput test is possible when using unpurified specimen combined with non-instrumental eg colorimetric detection yan et al 2020 yu et al developed an isothermal lamp based method for rapid colorimetric detection of covid-19 yu et al 2020b the sensitivity was 976 4243 and read-out time was 30 min besides lamp other isothermal amplification methods including rolling circle amplification

patients who present a late and very low viral load below the detection limit of rt-qpcr assays detection of igm antibodies tends to indicate a recent exposure to sars-cov-2 whereas detection of covid-19 igg antibodies indicates virus exposure some time ago recombinant sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein rn and spike protein rs are evaluated using as antigens in elisa for covid-19 igmigg

financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 a new family of coronavirus can cause severe respiratory infections 1 the disease caused by sarscov2 has been recently named as the coronavirus disease2019 covid19 by the world health organization who since the first report in december 2019 a severe outbreak caused by sarscov2 in china has rapidly spread to multiple regions of the world 2 3 4 who has defined covid19 as a pandemic due to the speed and scale of transmissionamong a total of 81 385 case records reported by the chinese center for disease control and prevention most covid19 patients were classified as mild 81 14 were severe and 5 were critical the overall casefatality rate cfr was 23 and no deaths were reported in mild and severe cases however the cfr among critical cases was 49 5 some patients particularly those of older age and with preexisting comorbid conditions could develop to critical illness and died of multiple organ failure in a short period of time 5 6 thus efficient indicators for evaluation of disease severity and clinical progression still need further investigation which is urgently needed for reducing covid19 mortalityprevious studies have shown that many laboratory biomarkers such as lymphocyte numbers lactate dehydrogenase and ddimer are out of normal ranges in covid19 patients 6 7 these laboratory biomarkers are routine and are the most available in clinics another study compared plasma cytokine levels between patients admitted to the intensive care unit icu and those not requiring icu admission and found that many cytokines such as interleukin il2 il7 il10 granulocytecolonystimulating factor gcsf interferon gammainducible protein10 ip10p chemotactic protein1 mcp1 mip1a and tumor necrosis factor tnf had higher levels in icu patients compared with nonicu patients 8 however available markers for predicting the progression of patients with covid19 are limitedin this study we analyzed the differences of different biomarkers including blood routine cytokine profiles procalcitonin pct creactive protein crp and ferritin among covid19 patients with different severity illness our data showed that il2rlymphocytes could be used for early identification of severe covid19this study recruited covid19 patients from 24 january to 15 february 2020 admitted at tongji hospital wuhan china patients who had clinical symptoms fever cough or shortness of breath and radiological characteristics unilateral pneumonia bilateral pneumonia or groundglass opacity and with positive sarscov2 realtime reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rtpcr results were continuously recruited patients younger than 18 years were excluded symptoms signs and laboratory tests during the hospital stay were collected this study was approved by the ethical committee of tongji hospital tongji medical college huazhong university of science and technology wuhan china grant number tjc20200128 date 2020212covid19 patients were classified into three groups with different illness severity according to the guidelines of diagnosis and treatment for covid19 made by the chinese national health commission as follows  1 mild patients had typical symptoms and radiological findings 2 severe patients met one of the following criteria  respiratory distress respiration rate  30 timesmin blood oxygen saturation spo2  93 in the resting state and arterial partial pressure of o2 to fraction of inspired oxygen pao2fio2 ratio  300 mmhg and 3 critical the patients met one of the following criteria  respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunction or failure needing icu treatment clinical information related to patient classification was collected from the medical records of the patientsthroat or nasalswab specimens from the upper respiratory tract of all patients on admission were collected and maintained in a viral transport medium sputum specimens were also collected in some patients sarscov2 infection was confirmed using taqman onestep rtpcr kits from shanghai huirui biotechnology company ltd and shanghai biogerm medical biotechnology company ltd both of which were approved by the china food and drug administration in brief rna was extracted from clinical samples with commercial rna extraction kits then 5 l of rna template was used for realtime rtpcr which targeted the open reading frame orf1ab and nucleoprotein gene conditions for applications of realtime rtpcr were as follows 50c for 15 min and 95c for 5 min 45 cycles of amplification at 95c for 10 s and 55c for 45 s the positive covid19 realtime rtpcr result was defined if both orf1ab and nucleoprotein cycle thresholds were  35serum samples were collected from the included participants on admission or at the time of disease aggravation in those who recovered from illness the serum samples prior to hospital discharge were also collected the levels of il1 il2r il8 il10 and tnf in serum were measured according to an automatic procedure of a solidphase twosite chemiluminescent immunometric assay via immulite 1000 analyzer siemens munich germany the level of il6 was measured using the electrochemiluminescence method roche diagnostics basel switzerlandthe results are presented as mean  standard deviation sd differences of markers among the three groups were compared by analysis of variance anova the differences of markers between different timepoints from the same patients were analyzed using the paired students ttest spearmans rank correlation test for nonparametric data was employed to analyze the relationship between two factors all statistically significant variables were taken as candidates for multivariable logistic regression analyses and the regression equation predictive model was obtained the regression coefficients of the predictive model were regarded as the weights for the respective variables and a score for each patient was calculated receiver operating characteristic roc analysis was performed to determine the best threshold value of the laboratory markers for distinguishing critical illness patients from mild or severe illness patients area under the curve auc sensitivity and specificity were reported statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism version 6 medcalc version 116 and spss version 220 statistical significance was determined as p  005this study included 389 hospitalized patients with confirmed covid19 the patients were classified into three groups with different severity of illness the basic characteristics of mild n  168 severe n  169 and critical n  52 patients are shown in table 1 the ages of severe 647  122 and critical 657  142 patients were significantly higher than mild patients 566  139 the percentage of males was higher than females in severe and critical groups the most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever cough fatigue expectoration and shortness of breath other symptoms were chest distress diarrhea muscle ache headache nausea and vomiting more than half the patients had chronic diseases including hypertension 329 diabetes 10 cardiovascular 82 diseases and chronic kidney disease 33 table 1the results of blood routine infectious biomarkers and cytokine profiles in different groups are shown in fig 1 we observed that leukocytes neutrophils crp pct and ferritin were significantly increased while lymphocytes were significantly decreased in severe and critical patients compared with mild patients fig 1ab these biomarkers also showed statistically significant differences between severe and critical patients the cytokine profiles including il1 il2r il6 il8 il10 and tnf on admission were detected we found that the cytokine profiles except il1 were all significantly increased with increased severity of illness fig 1c moreover the concentration of il2r was positively correlated with that of il6 il8 il10 and tnf fig 2ad we also observed that the amount of il2r was negatively correlated with lymphocyte numbers fig 2e we then further calculated the ratio of il2r to lymphocytes and found that the value of il2rlymphocytes was remarkably increased in severe and critical patients compared with mild patients fig 2ffor the prediction of severe covid19 patients all statistically significant variables were taken as candidates for further multivariable logistic regression analyses we found that the increase of il2rlymphocytes crp and ferritin were associated with increased odds and chosen as the prediction model indicators of severe covid19 odds ratios or and their corresponding confidence intervals are shown in table 2 roc analysis showed that il2rlymphocytes had a higher auc 0948 than crp 0886 and ferritin 0812 to differentiate critical from mild patients the performance of il2rlymphocytes to distinguish severe from mild patients was poor fig 3a however il2rlymphocytes showed a sensitivity of 909 and a specificity of 665 to differentiate between critical and severe patients fig 3b and a sensitivity of 942 and a specificity of 821 in distinguishing critical from mild patients fig 3cfurthermore we monitored the change of lymphocytes and cytokine levels in the disease progression of sarscov2infected patients in the 28 recovered patients lymphocyte numbers gradually increased to normal levels while the levels of il2r il6 il8 il10 tnf and il2rlymphocytes were significantly decreased between the time of admission and hospital discharge fig 4 in contrast lymphocyte numbers were further decreased while cytokines and il2rlymphocytes were significantly increased in the deteriorated patients fig 5the prevalence of covid19 began from december 2019 then quickly spread worldwide and has now become an urgent public health challenge in this study we report a cohort of 389 patients with laboratoryconfirmed sarscov2 infection most patients presented with fever cough and fatigue which share similar clinical features with previous betacoronavirus infections such as sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 9 10 highly pathogenic human coronaviruses hcov infections frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease and disease severity was influenced by initial viral titers in airways age and comorbid conditions 6 11 12 we observed that in severe and critical patients the percentage of males was higher than females and the mean ages of these patients were much older than mild patients moreover critical patients were accompanied by high percentages of manifestations and comorbidities indicating the poor prognosis and high cfr of these patients therefore it is of crucial significance to find potential markers to identify critical patients early and give timely effective treatmentlymphopenia was observed during sars and mers infections 13 similarly the developed lymphopenia was also very common in covid19 and this phenomenon was more obvious in icu patients 6 7 the mechanisms of lymphopenia in sarscov2 infection might be due to inhibition of the cellular immune effective function and more cells underwent apoptosis following overactive inflammatory responses as reported in sars infection 14 the results of lymphocytes might be associated with disease severity and mortalitymassive inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine storms could result in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome during sars and mers infections which have been specially emphasized for the pathogenesis of hcov infections 15 in covid19 both t helper type 1 th1 and th2 cell responses were initiated and the increased amounts of cytokines eg il1 ifn ip10 mcp1 il10 and il4 were associated with disease severity 6 a recent pathological report of covid19 has also shown that the counts of cd4 t and cd8 t cells were decreased but with high expression of human leukocyte antigen drelated hladr and cd38 the overactivation of t cells including the increase of proinflammatory th17 cells and high cytotoxicity of cd8 t cells might lead to the severe immune injury 16 during viral infection adaptive immune cells not only played a crucial role in virus clearance but also in dampening innate immunity and limiting further damage to the host 17 18 however exuberant inflammatory responses promoted t cell apoptosis thus resulting in uncontrolled inflammatory responses due to diminished t cell responses our data demonstrate that infection biomarkers such as crp pct and ferritin and the concentrations of il2r il6 il8 il10 and tnf were all significantly increased with the increased illness severity suggesting that the magnitude of the cytokine storm results in high morbidity and mortality attributed by immunopathologyreliable and feasible early identification of severe patients is crucial in clinical practice as the mortality of these patients is extremely high 5 however the available laboratory markers have limited value at present during immune activation cd25 is expressed by t cells and its soluble form scd25 also known as il2r is released into the bloodstream 19 our data show that increased il2r and lymphopenia were both correlated with the severity of covin19 moreover the concentration of il2r was positively correlated with il6 il8 il10 and tnf and negatively correlated with lymphocytes therefore the value of il2rlymphocytes was superior to reflect the imbalance of inflammation and immune responseil2rlymphocytes crp and ferritin were selected as prediction markers of severe illness by multivariable logistic regression analyses these markers show that infection injury of immunity and an exaggerated inflammatory response might exert synthetic efforts on the progression of severe illness the performance of il2rlymphocytes exhibited higher sensitivity and specificity in differentiating critical patients from mild or severe patients the application of il2rlymphocytes would allow the early diagnosis and treatment of critical patients and decrease mortality furthermore concentrations of cytokines including il2r il6 il8 and tnf were decreased but lymphocytes were increased in recovered patients however lymphocytes were further decreased with high levels of cytokines in diseasedeteriorated patients therefore the monitoring these laboratory markers and cytokines could also be used to predict the progression of covid19several limitations of this study should be mentioned first not all laboratory tests have been included as these markers are also valuable in covid19 such as coagulation and chemistry markers secondly the percentage of severe patients was high in the included population as tongji hospital was a designated hospital for admitting severe patients so the prediction model might have some bias thirdly continuous monitoring data in one patient at different disease courses is limited and needs to be further validated in larger populationsin summary this study demonstrates that lymphopenia and high concentrations of cytokines were associated with the pathogenesis of covid19 and the findings of the study could help in more clearly understanding the immune disorder of the disease il2rlymphocytes are a prominent biomarker for early identification of severe patients and predicting the clinical progression of covid19we declare no competing interestslung transplantation lntx as a treatment option for endstage lung disease has dramatically increased over recent decades1 infection and rejection are the most common complications after lntx2 and early identification is crucial to outcome3 both conditions present with similar symptoms such as dyspnea lowered forced expiratory volume in 1 second fev1 and lowgrade fever and they can therefore be difficult to distinguish clinically however lntx patients may lack classical signs of infection due to heavy immunosuppression and rejection may be asymptomatic in addition there are possible links between infection and the development of rejection4 for example viral pneumonia has been associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction and graft loss5 moreover growth of bacteria or fungi in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf cultures does not always represent infection as bacterial and fungal colonization of the transplanted lung is common infections with multidrugresistant bacteria pose an increasing threat to solid organ transplant recipients and the discrimination between infection and colonization is important before starting longterm treatment of resistant bacteria with the possible side effects and interactions6
antimicrobial peptides in respiratory secretions play an important role as a first line of defence against infections7 lysozyme is the most abundant airway antimicrobial peptide and is secreted primarily by neutrophils and submucosal glands8 heparinbinding protein hbp was initially recognized for its broad antimicrobial activity but is now known to be a multifunctional inflammatory mediator that induces vascular leakage and acts as a chemoattractant and activator of monocytes9 10 the protein is stored in secretory and azurophilic granules of neutrophils and is rapidly released upon cell activation11 plasma hbp has been described as a promising biomarker for severe sepsis and septic shock12 and elevated hbp levels have also been shown in cerebrospinal fluid during bacterial meningitis13 and in urine during urinary tract infections14 neither hbp nor lysozyme has previously been evaluated in balf of lntx patients in this study we quantified the two proteins together with the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin il1 il6 il8 and tnf and antiinflammatory il10 in balf collected during the first year after transplantation the primary aim was to evaluate hbp and lysozyme as potential biomarkers for infection and to determine their ability to discriminate infection from rejection in lung transplant recipientsthis prospective cohort study was conducted at skne university hospital one of two centers in sweden that performs lntx adult patients accepted for lntx during the study period from october 2012 to december 2014 were eligible for inclusion patients younger than 18 years of age and patients with postoperative followup at other sites were excluded all study participants were followed for a maximum of 1 year after transplantation written informed consent was obtained from all study patients the study was approved by the regional ethics committee reg nr 43308 and performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 declaration of helsinki and its later amendments standard protocol for immune suppression included induction therapy with atg antithymocyte globulin followed by tacrolimus or cyclosporine mycophenolate mofetil and steroids all lntx recipients were treated with cytomegalovirus and fungal prophylaxis for 36 monthsbalf samples were collected at routine scheduled bronchoscopies at 3 and 6 months after lntx or at diagnostic bronchoscopies performed in response to clinical symptoms a minimal interval of 7 days was allowed between bals to be included as a new sample in the study bal procedure followed a standardized protocol study samples for analyses of hbp lysozyme and cytokines were obtained after installation of 20 ml phosphatebuffered saline pbs where the initial 10 ml of balf was discharged after which a study sample of 10 ml was collected portions of 20 ml of pbs were then instilled to collect balf according to a standard protocol for bacterial fungal and cytological analyses balf was

factor hbp il8 and il1 still increased significantly with infection figure 4 whereas lysozyme il6 il10 and tnf did not based on auc values and ureaadjusted results il1 and il8 performed best of the tested cytokines and only these two were used for further comparisons with hbp and lysozyme when comparing the biomarkers to semiquantitative analysis of inflammation in tbb and cytology data available in 85 of samples hbp il1 and il8 but not lysozyme were significantly more sensitive in diagnosing infection compared to grade of inflammation aucs 085 090 087 067 and 071 respectivelyto account for the possibility of bias due to multiple samples from the same individual and to adjust for time after transplantation we used generalized estimating equation gee models using gee analyses the estimated ors for the prediction of definite and probable infection as compared to no or possible infection and rejection were 32 95 ci 9112 for hbp 17 95 ci 648 for il1 17 95 ci 646 for il8 and 4 95 ci 28 for lysozyme at set cutoffsin this prospective study on lung transplant recipients comparing different biomarkers for prediction of infection we found that hbp il1 and il8 were the best balf biomarkers of infection samples from patients with tbbverified rejection had low levels of all tested biomarkers with concentrations in the same range as noninfection samplesneutrophils are recruited to the airways in response to infection and increased neutrophil numbers are found in balf during bacterial infection18 neutrophil counts were not analyzed in this study which is a major shortcoming given that both hbp and lysozyme are released from activated neutrophils other studies have demonstrated that hbp is a better diagnostic marker of infection than neutrophil counts in cerebrospinal fluid during meningitis in urine during urinary tract infection and in plasma during sepsis12 13 14 in the present study hbp was more sensitive in diagnosing infection compared to grade of inflammation in tbb and cytology however this analysis is semiquantitative only and further studies are required to evaluate how hbp and the other markers compare to neutrophil counts in balsimilar to hbp and lysozyme all cytokines increased with the likelihood of infection mirroring increased inflammation il10 has antiinflammatory properties but showed the same pattern as the proinflammatory cytokines in this study il10 is believed to play an important role in balancing the inflammatory response in order to limit host tissue damage19 for example compared to wildtype mice il10deficient mice demonstrate more efficient bacterial clearance but higher mortality and increased neutrophil recruitment to the lung in response to streptococcus pneumoniae infection20 which underscores the regulatory role of il10 during infection it could therefore be speculated that il10 increases simultaneously with proinflammatory cytokines in order to avoid excessive inflammation that would be harmful to the hostto correct for dilution factors of balf we used the urea method as described before however with infection urea concentrations might increase in balf due to inflammation and increased plasma leakage thus causing a false low biomarker level when adjusting to a urea plasmabal coefficient moreover not all balf samples could be urea adjusted as a corresponding plasma sample was missing which gives the test less power even so il1 il8 and hbp showed significantly higher values with infection in line with our findings it was recently shown that il1 and il8 in balf are potential markers of ventilatorassociated pneumonia vap21 which further strengthens their utility as biomarkersin this study we found no significant differences in levels between rejection and noninfection for any of the biomarkers contrary to our results patella et al have demonstrated increased levels of il10 during rejection compared to no rejection22 one possible reason for this discrepancy is that rejection is defined differently in the two studies here we identify rejection with tbb to ensure correct diagnosis all tested biomarkers have in common that they indicate neutrophildominated inflammation in contrast rejection is primarily a t celldriven process23 which may explain why none of the markers in this study were elevated in this group however the distinction is difficult as infection can drive rejection and tbb staging can also be false positive in the presence of infection in our study all but two patients with rejection had repeated positive tbbs which increases the likelihood of true resultsmost infections are reported to occur within the first 3 months after lntx especially those of bacterial origin24 in our study we noted a tendency toward a decreasing risk of infection with time after transplantation however the total risk of infection has not been assessed in this study as infections occurring between bronchoscopies may have been missed and cultures from sputum and other locations were not considered we chose to define infection as samples graded probable and definite infection in our calculations we believe this is appropriate in this clinical setting with immunocompromised patients where treatment of a probable infection would be justifiedthis was a singlecenter study with a limited number of patients which is a shortcoming to our study second even if efforts were made to have a standardized protocol for bal procedure and study sampling we cannot fully estimate the dilution factor however with the described urea method we have tried to address this problem another difficulty was the definition of infection in these patients we have made efforts to ensure that the groups definite and no infection are correct however there is a risk of misclassification in the groups possible and probable infection as infection is difficult to diagnose in these patients and some may be colonized with bacteria rather than infected moreover a large proportion of patients with clinically suspected infection had received prior antibiotic or antifungal treatment at the time of bronchoscopy which may have affected the grading of infection if present this misclassification would likely bias the estimates towards the null as prior treatment may result in false negative cultures and possibly decreasing levels of the biomarkers despite a potential for misclassification we could demonstrate that all tested biomarkers and especially hbp il1 and il8 increase with infectioninfection and rejection are common complications in lung transplant recipients and early diagnosis and treatment is important for outcome in this study we show that hbp il1 and il8 could be useful biomarkers for the detection of pulmonary infection in lntx patients hbp has not previously been evaluated in lntx patients and could be a simple and rapid tool for diagnosis of infection of interest the biomarkers also seemed to discriminate between infection and rejection however the relevance and further characterization of the actual markers need to be validated in further larger prospective studiesthe authors of this manuscript have conflicts of interest to disclose as described by the american journal of transplantation one of the authors bc of this manuscript is listed as coinventor on a patent on the use of hbp as a diagnostic tool in sepsis filed by hansa medical ab the other authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose

in late 2019 a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was identified as the cause of an outbreak of acute respiratory illness in wuhan china in february 2020 the world health organization designated the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 so far the infection has spread to include hundreds of thousands worldwide with confirmed cases increasing despite the austere measures applied 1 2the novel coronavirus causes a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in humans with a large fraction of patients developing a short period of moderate clinical illness 13 nevertheless a small but substantial number of patients experience severe pneumonia which may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards sepsis and septic shock and multiple organ failure 4 the disease severity is influenced by many factors such as the initial viral titers in the airways the age or the comorbid conditions of the infected individual 5the pathogenesis of covid-19 disease is not completely understood virus may spread through the respiratory mucosa and infect other cells inducing a cytokine storm in the body a recent study demonstrated that patients with covid-19 pneumonia who developed ards had significantly higher neutrophil count and more severe cytokine storm than those without ards 5 while several authors have reported a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicating the consumption of immune cells which may be fatal in older patients or patients with comorbidities 6 7 in addition although we know that coronaviruses are able to initiate myocardial injury it is too early to fully characterize and quantify the cardiovascular impact of covid-19 however arrhythmias hypotension and coronary syndromes have been reported in patients diagnosed with covid-19 of note by march 11 italy had 12462 confirmed cases and 827 deaths 66 mortality with more than two out of three of them reporting diabetes or cardiovascular disease at this time the full breadth and kinetics of immune responses in covid-19 patients remain largely unknown but it seems that a common manifestation among severe cases is the high levels of proinflammatory cytokines 1 considering that this cytokine storm can initiate viral sepsis and inflammatory-induced complications which may lead to organ damage and death a reliable prognostic biomarker would be invaluable today for the triage of covid-19 patientsthe soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor supar is the soluble form of the cell membrane-bound protein urokinase plasminogen activator receptor upar supar has a secondary structure of 17 anti-parallel -sheets with three short -helices there are three homologous domains of supar causing its distinct ligand binding properties the gpi-anchor links upar to the cell membrane making it available for upa binding although there are three different supar forms supari-iii suparii-iii and supari only suparii-iii is known to be a chemotactic agent for promoting the immune system supar and its ligand are involved in numerous physiological and pathological pathways including the plasminogen activating pathway modulation of cell adhesion and migration and proliferation through interactions with extracellular matrix proteinsthe predictive ability of supar has been reported to be equal to or better than other scoring systems and thus its addition to conventional triage algorithms may improve risk stratification 8 in a study of 42452 acutely presenting patients supar had the highest area under the curve of all investigated individual predictors including c-reactive protein crp while there was no significant difference in the predictive value between age groups 9 in another study including 17312 acutely admitted medical patients the addition of supar to national early warning score significantly improved risk prediction of both low- and high-risk acute medical patients 10 interestingly patients with low national early warning score but elevated supar had mortality risks comparable to that of patients with higher national early warning score three other studies reported that supar is significantly associated with 28-day 30-day and 90-day mortality 1113 of note nayak et al confirmed the previous findings and also reported an association between supar and long-term readmission rates 14 these cumulative data suggest that high supar level at admission is a marker of severe disease supar is associated with increased risk of readmission morbidity and mortality and can facilitate discrimination between survivors and non-survivors 1518 it may therefore provide benefit for evaluation of covid-19 patients to determine the requirement for a more intensive clinical assessment and care 19inflammation and oxidative stress are central components of the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury and emerging reports indicate that covid-19 manifestations can include renal tubular injury and collapsing glomerulopathy 2022 the latter is an aggressive and distinct histological variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis characterized by segmental or global glomerular tuft collapse with hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the overlying podocytes 23 although the pathogenesis of collapsing glomerulopathy in covid-19 patients is likely multifactorial upar is required for the development of podocyte foot process effacement and proteinuria 24 in addition the recent identification of cellular sources of supar demonstrates its pathogenic role as a circulating mediator of kidney disease indicating the devastating effects of inflammation and cytokine storm on the kidneys 25hayek et al identified an association between elevated plasma supar levels and the development of acute and chronic kidney disease this association was observed in patients with normal baseline kidney function and was independent of conventional risk factors for kidney disease 26 27 not surprisingly the inclusion of the supar level in a prediction model significantly improved discrimination of future risk of chronic kidney disease with the risk reclassification being greater than that with well-established biomarkers such as high-sensitivity c-reactive protein crp considering that there has been little progress in the overall risk stratification prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury these data suggest that supar meets critical requirements for a biomarker of acute and chronic kidney disease in patients with covid-19what is most important is that supar increases with the severity of the infection or organ dysfunction reflecting the bodys immune response and may have a strong prognostic value in covid-19 patients especially in those with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsisseptic shock 2832 in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome supar is a stronger marker of 2-day 30-day and 90-day mortality than crp or interleukin-6 28 while its levels do not correlate with the crp in patients with sepsis 3034 therefore supar reflects general activation of the immune system rather than exerting inflammatory actions this may be extremely important considering that the reported sensitivity for mortality and the negative predictive value of supar are  80 and 945 respectively 31 furthermore supar may be able to assist in the discrimination between an excessive immune response and immunosuppression facilitating early modulation of treatment strategysupar is an inflammatory biomarker that can be easily measured in plasma or serum the available test allows a fast prognosis for patients as the results can quickly be obtained on-site in the emergency room or other in-hospital settings avoiding the need for samples to be passed through the clinical laboratory or can even be obtained prior to hospitalization time to result 20 min based on the aforementioned evidence the supar could serve as a quick triage test and independent marker of clinical severity 30-day readmission complications and mortality in this pandemic 10 19 35 36 we believe that the results of ongoing trials in germany the uk denmark greece and the usa will be important for clinicians worldwidein conclusion supar seems extremely promising as a covid-19 prognostic marker and may assist in the early selection of patients who can stay at home or must be admitted to the hospital andor intensive care unit in this difficult outbreak humanity must use all the available weapons and supar may prove a powerful triage biomarkerin general the presence of proteins or metabolites in biological fluids will suppress the signals of the biomarkers generated from the microorganism cells during ms analysis therefore the development of specific affinity probes for target bacteria is an approach that can effectively minimize interference from sample matrices and concentrate the microorganisms of interest afonso and fenselau 5 described the detection of bacteria from complex biological mixtures using affinity capture coupled with maldi-ms they used an affinity methodusing a lectin-immobilized substrateto trap traces of bacterial cells from complex biological mixturesimmunomagnetic separation is a well-known technique that involves application of antibody-coated magnetic particles to separate pathogenic microorganisms and biological cells from clinical food and environmental samples madonna et al 6 developed a rapid method for identifying target bacteria from complex biological sample solutions by coupling immunomagnetic separation with maldi-ms this method requires only microliter volumes of materials for example a minimum of 10  107 bacteria cellsml could be detected from a physiological buffer in an analysis time of 1 h in addition nanoparticles nps have become interesting probes for the separation of analytes from sample solutions because of their large surface-to-volume ratios covalent binding between nps and targets is readily achieved by self-assembling thiolated molecules onto np surfaces lin et al 7 used mannose-encapsulated gold nps as nanoscale probes to recognize type 1 pili in escherichia coli gu and colleagues 28 proposed that vancomycin-modified fept nps biofunctional magnetic nps could be used as affinity probes to trap vancomycin-resistant bacteria they used spt bonding to capture the pathogens at concentrations of ca 101 colony-forming units cfuml within 1 h 2in a similar study chen and colleagues 9 used vancomycin-bound magnetic nps to trap staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus selectively from urine samples 3 ml containing bacteria at a concentration of ca 7  104 cfuml although most of these affinity methods have used maldi-ms for sample analysis lc-esi-ms should in principle be equally applicable recently liu et al 3 used pigeon ovalbumin poabound fe3o4al2o3 magnetic nps to capture uropathogenic e coli fig 2 provides a representation of this process the poa-bound magnetic particles were mixed with s saprophyticus and e coli j96 e coli j96 was selectively trapped isolated through magnetic separation and characterized by direct ms analysis of the npbacterium conjugatesdirect analysis of microorganisms using maldi-ms provides a number of advantages such as rapidity low detection limits simplified mass spectra featuring the signals of predominantly singly charged ions and tolerance to contaminants the protein profiles in whole-cell maldi mass spectra have taxonomically characteristic features that can be used to differentiate bacteria at the genus species and strain levels although only a small portion of the bacterial proteome is detected direct analyses of intact bacterial cells through maldi-tof ms have been used to differentiate bacterial species and subspecies in many clinical microbiology laboratories 10 fig 3 presents maldi mass spectra obtained from the direct analyses of intact bacterial cells of 4 pure cultures including s aureus enterococcus faecalis e coli and vibrio parahaemolyticus because the protein profiles clearly differ they can be used to differentiate these 4 bacteria identification and typing of microorganisms using maldi-ms has been very successful and reviewed by many authors 111121314 we do not attempt to cover this area herealthough esi-ms has been used less frequently for direct microbial identification xiang et al 15 characterized microorganisms by performing global esitandem mass spectrometry msms analyses of cell lysates vaidyanathan et al 16 reported the direct esi-ms analyses of whole bacterial cells without prior separation the newly developed technique of desorption electrospray ionization desi ms allows the direct analysis of condensed phase samples by spraying them with electrosprayed solvent droplets this approach has been used to differentiate several bacteria speciesincluding e coli s aureus enterococcus sp bordetella bronchiseptica bacillus thuringiensis bacillus subtilis and salmonella typhimuriumbased on their desi mass spectral profiles distinguishable desi mass spectra in the mass range 50500 da have been obtained from whole bacteria using both positive and negative ion modes the analysis time can be 2 min 17bioaerosol mass spectrometry bams has been developed to analyze and identify individual aerosolized microbial particles in real time 14 bams has the potential to instantaneously detect species-level differences between single cells without the need for sample workup or preconcentration it offers a high degree of detection specificity and analysis times in the millisecond range it has been applied to the differentiation of the bacillus spore species b thuringiensis and b atrophaeus 18 and to the detection of airborne mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria 19 the reagentless bams reflectron mass spectra of bacillus spores and vegetative cells have been limited to signals having masses of less than mz 300 although bams has provided some success at species-level differentiation it has been hindered by low sensitivity at high mass 18 improved high-mass sensitivity will extend the fingerprint mass range and increase the probability of detecting more robust species-specific biomarkersthe high-mass analyses of airborne pathogens can be improved by combining aerosol time-of-flight ms with maldi 20 in general the aerosol and matrix vapor are mixed and then transported into a cooling chamber where the matrix is condensed onto the aerosol the coated particles are then analyzed using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer van wuijckhuijse et al 20 developed an online system for analyzing proteins and other biological material present in single aerosol particles protein aerosol particles having masses of up to 20 000 da can be detected this mass range encompasses those of useful biomarkers for bacteria including bacillus spores 20gc-ms has been applied successfully to metabolite profiling for the characterization of microorganisms 21 the maximum molecular weight of compounds that can be analyzed by gc-ms is 1000 da for nonvolatile analytes conversion of samples to volatile compounds through derivatization or degradation is often required before gs-ms analysis ishida et al 22 applied thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation-gc in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide with maldi-mson-probe sample pretreatment as a complementary means of directly analyzing the bacterial phospholipids in whole cells e coli k-12 without requiring any tedious sample pretreatment stepsmas et al 23 studied the potential of gc-ms and direct-infusion ms methods to produce specific and discriminant metabolite profiles from different yeast mutants saccharomyces cerevisiae strains the combination of gc-ms with lc-ms can provide greater coverage of the metabolome 24 smilde et al 24 detected a very high number 93 of commercially available metabolites of the in silico metabolomes of b subtilis and e coli similar coverage 9597 for the same microorganisms and s cerevisiae required the application of 6 different analytical methods 25 in total 905 different metabolites were present in these 3 in silico metabolomes with 410 metabolites being unique to 1 of each of these 3 microorganismsgc-msms can improve the detection limit and specificity of the analysis of carbohydrate biomarkers eg muramic acid in complex environmental and clinical samples specifically this technique involves monitoring the specific transitions of precursor ions to fragment ions in the multiple reaction monitoring mode with this approach wunschel et al 21 studied the feasibility of using 2 variants of the alditol acetate procedure to analyze agar markers associated with spores of bacillus anthracis these methods could detect the agar background component 36-anhydro--l-galactose in the presence of spores pyrolysis-ms is often used to obtain a pyrolysate fingerprint to classify and identify bacteria pyrolysis is a process in which chemical or biochemical compounds are decomposed by heating pyrolysis products derived from many classes of compounds including lipids 26 and proteins 27 have all been used for bacterial discriminationcapillary electrophoresis ce-ms is a well-accepted multidimensional analytical approach that is complementary andor competitive to classic ms-coupled separation techniques 28 ce in combination with esi-ms has the ability to perform the rapid automated miniaturized and highly efficient separation of complex mixtures ce-ms is a useful technology for the discovery of biomarkers from pathogens 28 hu et al 29 identified bacterial species-specific proteins in a sample by performing ce-ms analysis on the proteolytic digest of the cell extract and monitoring only the selected marker peptide masses using msms through database searching they identified peptides that matched proteins associated with pseudomonas aeruginosa s aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and selected these peptides as marker ions for bacterial identification of the mixtures the method was later termed selective proteotypic-peptide analysis spa the spa method has also been used to identify the pathogens present in a saliva sample spiked with bacterial mixtures minor bacterial species present at even 1 relative abundance were identified with high confidence furthermore the rate of data analysis was greatly improved because only selected markers rather than whole protein digests were analyzed they also reported the identification of bacterial species using ce-ms and a database search algorithm with an empirical scoring function 30liquid chromatography coupled on- or off-line with ms is currently the most widely used analytical method for the separation and analysis of such biological samples as proteins peptides nucleotides and metabolites it is a separation technique presumably best suited for clinical applications in microbial analysis because of its chromatographic separation ability and flexibility of coupling multiple separation columns the effects of the sample preparation methods on the detection of bacterial proteins obtained from e coli by lc-esi-ms have been investigated 31 furthermore the effect of variations in the protein patterns on bacterial identification using a database search approach has been examined lo et al 32 used an lc-selective proteotypic-peptide analysis method to identify multiple bacterial species in a single ms analysis the corresponding bacterial species could be identified if the selected peptides eluted during the preset time window and could be identified correctly from the database this method has been applied to identify up to 8 pathogens present in bacterial mixtures in a single lc-selective proteotypic-peptide analysis experiment 32a multidimensional lc-ms method has been used for the rapid determination and identification of bacterial proteins by combining affinity purification with multidimensional protein identification technology krishnamurthy et al 33 reported the separation and characterization of a highly specific protein biomarker antigenic protein ea1 from sporulated b anthracis cellsalthough the lipid profiles may depend on the growth conditions phospholipids have proved to be useful biomarkers for some microorganisms 34 phospholipids can be ionized as intact entities for ms and msms analyses individual fatty acids present in bacterial cells can be identified from product ion msms spectra acquired in the negative ion mode dramatic improvements in the detection limits for phospholipid analysis have been achieved using esi-ms and msms 35 bacteriohopanepolyols bhps are membrane lipids produced by a wide range of eubacteria talbot et al 36 described the detailed lc-ms analyses of a number of less commonly reported but highly useful bhp markers derived from bacterial culturesseldi-ms is based on the retention of analytes on a target plate before maldi-ms analysis using affinity chromatography proteins are captured on a chemically or biochemically modified protein chip surface an advantage of the seldi technique is that target proteins can be characterized after they have been retained and purified on an affinity surface uniquely designed according to the specific properties of the proteins 37a protein profiling approach based on seldi-ms has been used for phenotypic discrimination of 4 closely related subspecies of francisella tularensis 38 the method is based on the differential binding of protein subsets to chemically modified surfaces the ability of the selective array surfaces to retain subsets of the proteome and to wash and desalt proteins on the array surface allows the direct analysis of bacterial lysates or other protein-containing samples thereby minimizing sample losses and accelerating sample preparation lancashire et al 39 used seldi-ms to identify potential biological markers for well-characterized strains of neisseria meningitides and created a model to distinguish them from closely related species shah et al 40 analyzed intact cells of human pathogens strains of fusobacterium nucleatum prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens using maldi- and seldi-ms to obtain specific spectral profiles that could be used to delineate bacterial species one key challenge for profiling methods is to achieve reproducible results standardized sample preparation protocols are always required to improve spectral reproducibilitymethods for microbial identification can be classified into phenotyping and genotyping categories genotypic techniques are based on the genetic conservation of a species and genetic variability among different species phenotypic testing which relies on physiological or biochemical characteristics can provide information about specific metabolic pathways or antibiotic resistance whereas traditional biochemical analysis remains a major approach used in clinical laboratories nucleic acidbased methods are gaining increasing popularity in clinical applicationsthe rapid analyses of pcr products through esi-ms and maldi-ms have been applied successfully to the identification of pathogens for instance mayr et al 41 reported the identification of bacteria using a combination of pcr and lc-ms the specificity of this method in a human background was successfully tested by amplifying and analyzing 100010 000 genome equivalents of s aureus spiked into human plasma they also analyzed dna fragments amplified from the 16s rrna region that were amenable to the esi-msbased genotyping of 10 different bacterial species generally found in clinical environmentsto achieve a more accurate distinction among species rflps can be used after pcr to identify species based on the 16s rrna fragment patterns the fragments are obtained from digestion of the pcr products with restriction enzymes the decreased size of the digested pcr products also results in more favorable ionization and mass spectroscopic analysis the rflp method has been combined with maldi-ms to detect hepatitis b and c viruses hbv and hcv in human serum samples 4243 this method allowed the detection of as few as 100 copies of the hbv gene per milliliter of serum and the differentiation of wild-type and variant viruses 43 in all the reports discussed above the microbial species were distinguished based on size determination of the pcr-amplified specific marker genes using these approaches for accurate microbial identification is limited however because of length heterogeneities of specific marker genes von wintzingerode et al 44 developed a method for 16s rrna gene-based bacterial identification that combines base-specific fragmentation of pcr products with maldi-ms amplification of 16s rdna signature sequences in the presence of dutp is followed by uracil-dna-glycosylasemediated fragmentation at t-specific sites ms analysis of the base-specific fragment patterns has allowed unambiguous discrimination of several cultured bordetella species and as-yet-uncultured bacteriabecause of the difficulties associated with maldi-msbased analyses of dna several research groups have analyzed the more stable rna transcribed from dna pcr amplification of the16s rdna was performed using rna promotertagged forward primers and the in vitro transcription was followed using a t7 rna polymerase the base g-specific fragments were produced by rnaase t1 cleavage of the rna transcript and analyzed using maldi-ms 45single nucleotide polymorphisms snps arise from single base changes at specific positions in a genome snps are the most abundant form of genetic variation and can be used for pathogen identification many methods are available for determination of the alleles of a snp in addition to the conventional rflp approach mentioned above primer extension oligonucleotide ligation and hybridization have all been combined with ms for genotyping 46 ilina et al 47 used primer extension and maldi-ms to genotype hcv from hcv-positive blood sera and plasma they designed 3 oligonucleotide primers to detect 2 sets of genotype-specific snps the primer extension reaction was performed using modified thermostable dna polymerase in the presence of dideoxynucleosides the reaction products were analyzed using maldi-ms we note that the diversity of microbial strains and the occurrence of novel mutations limit the use of genotypic methods based on single nucleotide differences between strains genotypic identification assays using base-specific cleavage strategies however allow not only the differentiation of known sequence strains but also the detection of new strainstriangulation identification for the genetic evaluation of risks tiger is a promising approach for the detection of a broad spectrum of microorganisms 48 it uses high-performance esi-ms to detect the base compositions of pcr products the essential aspect of this approach is the use of intelligent pcr primers that target broadly conserved regions of microbial genomes that flank variable regions the pcr products in the 80- to 140-bp size range can be measured using high-resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance or time-of-flight ms in a high-throughput mode accurate mass measurements allow determination of the base compositions obtained from multiple primer pairs these base compositions were used to triangulate the identities of the pathogens the approach is equally well suited to the detection of bacteria viruses fungi and protozoa fig 4 presents esi-ms mass spectra of pcr amplicons derived from both strands of the tkt genes for 6 campylobacteria jejuni strains 49the same approach has been applied to the rapid identification and strain-typing of respiratory pathogens 50 broad-range pcr primers targeted highly conserved regions of 16s and 23s dna genes additional primers targeted to highly variable regions of specific bacterial genomes have been used for high-resolution genotyping of specific species identification of 14 isolates of 9 diverse coronavirus spp including the severe acute respiratory syndrome sarsassociated coronavirus has been demonstrated using the tiger approach with a detection limit of 1 pfu per milliliter of human serumdata analysis methods for the differentiation of pathogens can be based on the most straightforward profiling of intact proteins or on the complicated statistical treatment of ms data maldi-ms analysis of whole intact cells has been used for protein profiling of waterborne pathogen aeromonas 51 a library of mass signatures was established for 17 species of aeromonas the abundances of the ions were not taken into accountonly their masses were used to compile the library this approach has several advantageous features the ability to detect intact biomarkers eg proteins simple sample preparation and high throughput the challenge facing this technique is spectral reproducibility which is markedly influenced by variations in culture conditions and analytical parametersbecause of the complexity of mass spectral data many statistical algorithms have been developed to match the analyzed spectra to reference spectra or to generate biomarker spectra for microbial differentiation a biomarker-selective algorithm has been used to extract key signals from spectra the constructed biomarker library has been used to identify bacterial mixtures 52 the identification process involved comparison of the sample spectra with the library spectra using an algorithm similar to a statistical test of significance a maldi mass spectral database including 100 genera and 350 species has been compiled to characterize bacteria implicated in human infectious diseases 53 the authors noted that species- or subspecies-specific markers in the spectra are sometimes difficult to identify because the number of overlapping signal ions increases along with the number of strains registered in the databasethe 2 mathematical methods used most often for the classification of spectral data are multivariate analysis mva and the artificial neural network ann mva is based on multivariate statistics which involves observation and analysis of more than 1 statistical variable in this case mz at a time many mva techniquesincluding principal component analysis and cluster analysishave been applied to the differentiation of microorganisms the ann is an algorithm for machine learning this type of artificial intelligence allows the identification of biomarkers that are capable of distinguishing microbial speciesmultivariate statistics is often used to analyze pyrolysis mass spectra of bacterial samples principal component analysis pca has been applied to pattern recognition of fatty acid methyl esters profiles obtained from b anthracis yersinia pestis vibrio cholerae brucella melitensis and f tularensis 54 pca is the most commonly used multivariate data analysis tool pca is a technique for forming new variables ie principle components which are linear combinations of the original variables ie mz values in mass spectra the principle components account for the differences among spectra ilina et al 55 reported the direct bacterial profiling of 2 human pathogens n meningitidis and neisseria gonorrhoeae using maldi-ms cluster analysis grouped mass spectra into clusters by measuring similarities between spectra the method successfully separated the mass spectra collected from 3 groups that corresponded to the pathogenic and nonpathogenic neisseria isolates because the protein chip technique seldi may yield thousands of data points per bacterial sample computer algorithms must be used to identify useful biomarkers for bacterial identification seibold et al 56 differentiated single strains within the subspecies f tularensis by combining seldi-ms with cluster analysis and pca ann combined with seldi-ms has been used for the identification of n meningitides 39 and s aureus 57 the relative abundance for each mz value was used in the input layer of the ann model the output layer consisted of nodes representing target bacterial categories the model was trained using bacterial spectra to generate good correlation between input and output layers the model was further tested and validated using different sets of spectrademirev et al 58 developed an approach for microorganism identification that combines ms with protein database searches the protein masses in mass spectra are compared with those in the proteome databases probable organism sources are assigned to each mass with the best match ie that having the most matched proteins in theory leading to identification of the correct microorganism when using this approach spectral reproducibility is not critical as long as the observed masses match the protein masses in the database to avoid the limited mass accuracy of protein mass measurements the sequence information of the peptides from virus and bacterial samples has been used to identify the proteins and deduce the microorganisms source 59 the sequence information can be derived from fragmentation of intact proteins or proteolytic peptides of the intact proteins by searching fragment ion msms mass spectra against proteome databases top-down proteomics methodology identifies intact proteins without the need for biomarker digestion separation and cleanup this methodology has been used successfully for microbial proteomics in the analysis of bacterial species either pure or in a mixture 6061 microbial identification has been demonstrated using experimentally derived databases of virus-specific tryptic peptide masses 62 and bacterial protein masses 63data analysis using protein database search algorithms should be very accurate and useful as long as the protein databases are available for the pathogens of interest analysis of spectra using statistical methods is complicated further identification results may be inaccurate when the spectra are not reproducible however as mentioned above various statistical methods have been employed for differentiation among species or subspecies and proved to be useful pca has advantages because it is better to reveal differences between biomarker profiles than cluster analysis ann holds especially great promise for high throughput because it may require less computer timems-based identification of microorganisms currently plays a crucial role in clinical research because mass analyzers provide low detection limits universality yet with potential for selectivity and specificity and amenability to qualitative and quantitative analyses over a wide dynamic range cell culturing is by far the most used sample preparation technique for purifying and enriching microbial cells before mass spectrometric analysis although enrichment of pathogens using functionalized magnetic particles has not been applied to clinical samples the approach has proved successful for bacteria-spiked biological samples and should play an important role in the near future clinical specimens obtained from pus wound sputum and urine samples have all been analyzed using selective ce-msms methods 64 the analyses of bacteria-specific marker peptides provided additional advantages of excellent selectivity and high confidence in microbial identification the bacteria in these clinical samples were cultivated directly without prior isolation of a pure colony before performing the selective msms analyses many pathogen species table 1  were identified including p aeruginosa s aureus and streptococcus agalactiae the rapid and accurate discrimination between methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive microbial strains could lead to major improvements in the treatment strategies of infected patients du et al 65 used maldi-ms to identify clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible s aureus mssa and methicillin-resistant s aureus mrsa the comparative proteomic analyses of s aureus strains exhibiting different resistances toward the cell walltargeting antibiotic vancomycin have been performed with significant changes in the abundance of 65 proteins as determined using maldi-msms and lc-msms 66intact-cell ms has been used for the discrimination and identification of burkholderia cepacia complex species including strains of the novel taxon k recovered from cystic fibrosis patients 67 carbonnelle et al 68 reported the rapid maldi-msbased identification of intact staphylococci isolated in clinical microbiology laboratories they identified 23 clinically relevant bacterial species or subspecies belonging to the micrococcaceae familyreal-time pcr is at present the leading nonculturebased technique for the determination of infection 69 pcr-ms is currently conducted as a reference laboratory technique it has been used successfully to determine nucleotide compositions for strain typing in epidemiological studies of outbreaks of respiratory infections with streptococcus hemophilus or neisseria 50 extended-spectrum -lactamases esbls are among the most clinically significant -lactamases because they confer resistance to all penicillins cephalosporins and aztreonam ikryannikova et al 70 applied a maldi-msbased minisequencing method to the rapid detection of tem-type esbls in clinical strains of the enterobacteriaceae family hujer et al 71 demonstrated that esi-ms analysis of pcr amplification products could be used to identify quinolone resistance mediated by mutations in the quinolone resistancedetermining regions of 2 essential housekeeping genes the analysis provides critical information for therapeutic decision-making in the treatment of acinetobacter sp infectionsthe tools for determining the identity of a microbial sample include genetic and nongenetic methods and informatics ms has proven to be a useful method for the identification of biomarkers from microbial samples one of its major challenges however is the detection of candidate biomarkers from complex samples methods for sample analyses without pretreatment or after extensive biochemical and chromatographic fractionations have been developed to overcome the issues associated with sample complexity direct ms-based analyses of microorganisms have a number of advantages including rapidity and ease of operation the maldi interface is best suited for use in field-portable mass spectrometers deployed on battlefields or in our surroundings to detect microbial threats microbial analyses usually use a pure culture of microorganisms to avoid interference from the backgroundunless the interferents are absent or removed or data analysis algorithms are implemented the complexity of microbial biomarkers may be simplified through the use of various chromatography-based methods eg hplc and ce although the rate of identification is sacrificed to some extent the selectivity accuracy and dynamic range are improved substantiallysince the us anthrax mailing incidents in 2001 means of dealing with microbial threats have gained tremendous attention several recent outbreaks including the sars outbreak caused by coronavirus and the h1n1 flu outbreak caused by a novel influenza a virus have further triggered the development of more rapid sensitive and accurate real-time detection methods improvement of the detection limits for microbial cells will continue to be a major task in the years to come to this end cell enrichment through affinity techniques will play an increasingly important role top-down protein analysis and selective biomarker analysis coupled with affinity techniques will boost the detection capability and accuracy of microbial identifications pcr amplification of nucleic acids and ms detection might be an alternative approach toward improving sensitivity especially for the analyses of nonculturable microorganisms in addition to maldi several new ionization techniques including desorption electrospray ionization 72 direct analysis in real time 73 and esi-assisted laser desorption ionization 74 hold great potential for use in the real-time direct ms-based analyses of pathogens furthermore advances in other ms-related technologies will provide more powerful tools for characterization of pathogens these technologies include high-speed and high-resolution lc ion mobility spectrometry and high-capacity linear ion trap and various high-resolution mass analyzers such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance fourier transform-orbitrap and time-of-flight mass detectors the combination of these methodologies and instrumentation will certainly enhance the capabilities of ms for the analysis of pathogens

more than 571678 people have been infected by covid-19 and the death toll has reached 26494 as of march 28th 2020 with 62514 new daily cases reported in 24 h and deaths of 3159 worldwide 1 after the initial epidemic appeared in china it spread to dozens of other countries coronavirus disease covid-19 which is caused by a novel pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 caused the current global pandemic 2 during this pandemic the most critical questions aroused pertains to patients and clinicians in understanding how the disease spread to cause an epidemic what its clinical presentation with a severity profile is what assessment or diagnostic measures should be used and what projected treatments and influences to prognosis and recurrence there arecovid-19 has threatened the entire world for the health services providers it became a challenge to make rapid forward planning to evaluate the transmission rate of sars-cov-2 without ready access to diagnostic techniques and future planning based on the sustainability of healthcare systems to cope with the outbreak 3 pragmatic understanding of the novel pathogen sars-cov-2 revealed an essential genetic sequencing similarity to the previously known pathogen sars 4 a mean incubation period of 52 days of sars-cov-2 has been reported to cause the onset of symptoms and a mean 125 days for hospitalization from day of infection 5 6 fauci et al emphasized the time interval during the incubation of sars-cov-2 to hold crucial information on pathogenesis and asserted the need to understand it to design an effective containment policy 7 current understanding of covid-19 pathogenesis focuses on the angiotensin converting enzyme 2ace2 based sars-cov-2 cell entry that infects lung epithelial cells and synergistic entry through endosome proteases cell prime entry that infects the host cell 8 novel coronavirus also infects t-lymphocytes 9 recent retrospective studies revealed that elders are more prone to covid-19 and were more likely to require invasive mechanical ventilation with a high mortality among covid-19 infected patients and robust research revealed the clinical presentation of covid-19 currently covid-19 is detectable with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr which detects presence of genetic fragments of sars-cov-2 within secretions from nasal and pharyngeal epithelial mucus membrane employed techniques of rt-pcr and immunoglobulin presence detection methods have their own limitations of detection within a specific time period prior to detection through rt-pcr no method is available to assess covid-19 infection during incubation and after the onset of symptoms consequently a high transmission rate has been reported and needs to be reduced for effective containment 7 in this study we evaluated the current knowledge of covid-19 pathogenesis and its manifestation to formulate an easy method to detect and assess the covid-19 course of infection and to counter outbreaks by reducing transmission rates through early sensing and adopting appropriate measurescomparatively similar clinical features were previously reported to be caused by influenza influenza caused by h1n1 h3n2 and h5n1 produced variable symptoms in humans median incubation periods are 2 days 16 days and 25 days respectively all strains cause acute symptoms variable in nature and intensity 1016 h1n1 causes a fever similar to h3n2 with a relatively shorter duration of 12 days while h3n2 causes a fever of 16 days avian influenza h5n1 presents with baffling symptoms aggressive in nature like inexplicable diarrhea or encephalopathy intensity of the symptoms is high and related with areas of known outbreaks fever temperature  38c is present in symptomatic patients with abdominal features including vomiting diarrhea myalgia or arthralgia rhinorrhea cough and sputum production all signs and symptoms appeared concomitantly on median 2 or 3 days after infection 10 h1n1 causes symptoms to appear on day 2 the virus is detectable during a median period of 26 days after infection sore throat nasal congestion nausea vomiting and myalgia are common symptoms with a mild to severe fever distinguishing signs are enlarged lymph nodes tonsillitis and throat congestion while prominent features are leukopenia lymphopenia and hypokalemia 11 12 h3n2 significantly reduced the weight of patients during the early days of infection 13 14 severe cases of h5n1 presents with cardiomyopathies ventricular tachycardia renal failure ventilation assisted viral pneumonia reyes syndrome and pneumothorax death occurred due to multi-organ failure blood biomarkers abruptly developed leukopenia lymphopenia thrombocytopenia and elevated aminotransferases 15 16clinical manifestations of sars-cov-2 appeared variable as compared to influenza symptoms of covid-19 also vary slightly from region to region abdominal symptoms were more frequent in the usa than china 1721 asymptomatic mild and severe symptoms were observed in various studies 2227 asymptomatic or milder cases did not seek medical intervention mild symptoms included a temperature 375c and dry cough initially and could develop to moderate symptomatic cases fever cough abdominal discomfort and deranged blood biomarkers were recorded in moderate cases severe cases presented with shortness of breath dyspnea and tachypnea and required mechanical ventilation 28 persistent cough fever and fatigue were associated symptoms of an underlying pathology or pre-existing pathology not restricted to cardiovascular issues hypertension liver compromise and diabetes blood po2 levels decreased blood biomarkers developed lymphopenia thrombopenia and elevated aminotransferases in moderate and severe cases white blood cells deteriorated in severe cases and required mechanical ventilation persistent fever and characteristic consistent coughinginitially dry for several days followed by a productive coughare the main features in patients with pre-existing respiratory infections a few symptoms were variable with geographical regions 2938 in the current study we emphasized the pathogenesis of covid-19 assessed through signs and symptoms and its manifestation to formulate a practicable approach to detect and assess covid-19s course of infection to counter outbreaks by reducing the transmission rate through early sensing and adopting appropriate measureswe used a retrospective approach to collect observational data about the most common presenting signs and symptoms in reported cases of covid-19 data was searched with the terms clinical presentation of covid-19 clinical features of covid-19 covid-19 reported cases clinical picture of covid-19 covid-19 symptoms through search engines like google scholar pubmed and science direct to obtain any available updated information about the clinical aspects and clinical presentation of covid-19data was assessed for common presentations made by collected publications for sensing essential common symptoms the hashmi-asif covid-19 formula was designed based on collected data that adhered to the most common and easily accessible symptoms which can affect an early diagnosis of covid-19 or due to their absence could delay diagnosis or cause misdiagnosis the important differentiating clinical features signs and symptoms were aligned in table form providing a sketch of the most common essential symptoms data about the frequency of symptoms in relation with covid-19 diagnosis were categorized into clinical features and blood biomarkers we categorized common symptoms and blood biomarkers for covid-19 extracted from the collected data and these were categorized into two groupsthe classification of normal to severe symptoms was determined from collected data containing values ratios with interquartile ranges and percentages of occurrence in observational studies four scoring tiers were formulated each sign and symptom were assigned a score by using the borg scale scoring method previously described by hommerding et al 39 with slight modifications signs and symptoms were given a score between 1 and 4 normal signs and symptoms were given a score of 1 and placed in the first tier mild presentation in signs and symptoms were given a score of 2 and placed in the second tier third tier includes moderately presenting symptoms given a score of 3 and severe cases were given a score of 4 in the fourth tier the highest score in the fourth tier scores 39 which represents severe disease while the lowest in the first tier scores 11 and showed normal or no disease mild disease scored between 13 and 22 and moderate disease scored between 23 and 33 variable scoring showed stages of the disease as mild moderate or severe minimum and maximum scores were calculated and evaluated for the available data collected and compiled in table 1 all data were calculated on the score chart to evaluate its efficacy for detecting early common signs and symptoms to make an easy decision on whether to hold isolation and other immediate measures surrounding the early confirmation of covid-19 the chart was given the name of the hashmi-asif covid-19 formula for calculating early common signs and symptoms of covid-19 for early detection and disease assessmentwe investigated the relationship of frequent appearances of common signs and symptoms with diagnosed covid-19 cases by pearson correlation and spearman correlation coefficient rho two-tail 38 cumulative frequencies of each common sign and symptom were assessed by chi-square test two tail with cramers v strength methods 40 highly significant symptoms and signs showing correlation were assessed by the linear regression method to establish ostensible correlation compiled data was analyzed statistically by using ibm spss version20twenty studies containing detailed information of 10172 covid-19 laboratory confirmed cases showed a common symptomatic correlation with covid-19 were statistically significant sig 0000 for each sign and symptom fever at 439 was significant 0000 cough at 5408 and dry mucus membrane at 2568 values were equally significant 0000 hyperemic mucus membrane at 1792 was significant with p  0005 leukopenia 2811 and lymphopenia 6435 showed a significance of 0000 thrombopenia 3549 showed a strong correlation sig0000 with covid-19 at significant p 001 amino transferases alt and ast 5002 and 3449 respectively showed a strong correlation and were statistically significant 0001 thereafter symptoms holding high sensitivity correlations star values with the development of covid-19 were extracted by linear regression model statistical data is shown in table 2 symptoms frequency appearance in covid-19 was assessed by chi-square method and results shown in table 2 fever and lymphopenia frequency showed a similar significance p  0000 cough showed a significance frequent appearance in covid-19 p  002 dry mucus membrane and thrombopenia showed a similar significance p  0006 hyperemic mucus membrane did not show a significant value p  0062 while aminotransferases showed an equal significance p  0001symptoms of covid-19 were classified into early symptoms and late symptoms based on severity early symptoms can be a point of consideration for getting early detection covid-19 diagnosis could be missed during the early stage because of early symptoms being mild in nature however distinct evaluations for covid-19 could be made by calculating scores of correlated blood biomarkers analysis through the hashmi-asif covid-19 chart as elaborated in chart 1 common signs and symptoms were classified according to severity including normal with no disease milder moderate and severe cases the formula contains a maximum of 39 1524 scores out of which cases with a cumulative scoring ranging from 132239 should be considered at high risk to be diagnosed with covid-19 isolated immediately and should be evaluated by standard diagnostic procedure rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 the formula provides an easy approach to screen the suspects and carriers of covid-19 34 days earlier than current procedures because oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs detected positive for sars-cov-2 by rt-pct after an average of 7 days of infection blood oxygen saturation does not change much at early stages and the reason was not included in the calculation formula oxygen saturation decreases during advanced stages of covid-19 and time can be saved by taking such early measures decreased o2 gas in the blood is signifies a critical situation that requires urgent interventionsscoring on the hashmi-asif covid-19 chart is based on the course of disease of covid-19 described in recent reports 17 18 the course of disease of covid-19 is divided into four stages by the authors first a healthy status scoring 12 on the chart is normal second a milder disease form holding some bodily response in blood bio-markers and slight changes occurring in the values of biomarker these changed responses include neutrophil based antiviral response lymphopcytes reduction because lymphocytes get infected by sars-cov-2 9 and slight changes in aminotransferases milder cases score between 13 and 22 on the hashmi-asif covid-19 chart moderate disease produced a sufficient response within the body to be measured through blood biomarkers and changes in biomarker values scored 2333 on the chart severe cases showed a full body response to viral attack and scored 3439early detection for covid-19 in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases showed its ability to isolate covid-19 cases at an early stage the calculation chart is provided with double calculation methods to enhance the sensitivity of the outcome the formula provides an easy approach to screen the suspects and carriers of covid-19 earlier than previously being diagnosed the hashmi-asif covid-19 formula expedites the ability of health care providers in developing countries lacking appropriate health facilities to diagnose covid-19 the hashmi-asif covid-19 formula based on the most common early presentations of the covid-19 and on changing response in signs and symptoms and blood biomarkers has made evaluating covid-19 easier by using the formula covid-19 can be diagnosed 7296 h earlier than it currently can it will provide ample time to adopt interventions for covid-19 and to reduce the mortality rate by early management the chart can be helpful to restrict transmission rates of sars-cov-2  1 consequently decreasing infection spread in contacts the hashmi-asif covid-19 formula expedites the ability of health care providers in developing countries lacking appropriate facilities to diagnose covid-19 the hashmi-asif covid-19 formula works via calculation of scores of the most common early presentations of covid-19 separate calculations of scoring for signs and symptoms and blood biomarkers made it appropriate for covid-19 detection and evaluation the chart also provides a tool to assess whether the status of covid-19 is either progressing or reducing toward a healthy situationour study has various limitations it is a retrospective study based on reported clinical manifestations and probable courses of disease from available data around the world individual data of patients of covid-19 were less reported and collective analyzed data was evaluated a prospective study is underway to evaluate the utilization of the hashmi-asif covid-19 assessment chart and its efficacy within domestic covid-19 patientsthe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding authorethical review and approval was not required for the study on human participants in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements written informed consent for participation was not required for this study in accordance with the national legislation and the institutional requirementsall authors listed have made a substantial direct and intellectual contribution to the work and approved it for publicationthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestin late 2019 clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in wuhan china the causative agent was identified as a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 the disease was named covid-19 as of march 2020 it has caused many hundreds of thousands of confirmed cases and tens of thousands of deaths worldwide john hopkins university coronavirusmap sepsis is the most frequently observed complication followed by respiratory failure acute respiratory deficiency syndrome ards heart failure and septic shock zhou et al 2020a old people and particularly those affected by one or more comorbidity are the most vulnerable subjects where the highest morbidity and mortality has been reported associated with sequential organ failure and high d-dimer levels onder et al 2020 shi et al 2020 zhou et al 2020a moreover in some countries like italy men appear to be more affected and have a higher mortality than women in order to react effectively to the ongoing and future pandemics we must improve diagnostics as well as biomarker discovery and validation for prognosis and for intervention moreover minimum standards are necessary for all sampling procedures it is not enough to just diagnose good prognostic and predictive biomarkers are neededfor long-term gain we suggest that the most useful biomarkers are the ones that allow us to understand the age-related mechanisms underlying a respiratory infectious disease pandemic such as covid-19 here we can build upon conceptual frameworks developed over the last decade describing how immune status is influenced by aging processes see also section 3 in brief aging processes such as chronic inflammation and cellular senescence affect the innate as well as the adaptive immune system oh et al 2019 specifically older and multi-morbid people are suffering from inflammaging franceschi et al 2000 franceschi et al 2018a franceschi et al 2018b a chronic low-level inflammation caused by exposure of the immune system to misplaced andor misfolded self-antigens originating from dying cells fragments of mitochondria extracellular vesicles and senescent cells franceschi et al 2017a the higher mortality from covid-19 in older people in subjects with comorbidities and in males can then be explained in part by their higher inflammatory status including an activation of the innate immune system and the triggering of an inflammatory storm that includes il-6 and other cytokines bonaf et al 2020 herold et al 2020 mehta et al 2020 moore and june 2020 santesmasses et al 2020 storci et al 2020 as well as inflammatory molecules such as mitochondrial dna fragments pinti et al 2014 all assumed to be associated with dramatic changes of the peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets cossarizza et al 2020 moreover a difference in the amount of inflammaging between men and women bonafe et al 2001 could explain in part the higher vulnerability of males to covid-19 marquez et al 2020 specifically bonaf et al 2020 suggests that men feature higher levels of subclinical systemic inflammation connected with a blunted acquired immune system a blunted type i interferon response and with accelerated biological aging as well as downregulation of the ace2 sars-cov-2-receptor which paradoxically triggers inflammation in the aged and comorbid thus there is a strong specific rationale for implicating aging-related processes in covid-19 mortality suggesting that interventions into these processes can contribute significantly to better outcomes in this pandemic and the next here we do not just call for action but we provide a detailed outline of what can be done and must be done for maximum health gain for the elderly in addition to the standard diagnostic testswe propose proactive biomarker research as part of ongoing disease screening during a pandemic such as covid-19 the suspected cases being screened are called the cohort of probands or patients for probands screened during a serious respiratory disease epidemic and found to be positive for the infectious agent we suggest that the relevant outcomes to predict are disease manifestation subsequent disease deterioration including hospitalization and need for intensive care long-term morbidity after hospital discharge and mortality fig 1
 disease deterioration can be measured in detail by clinical outcomes see eg zhou et al 2020a long-term morbidity for example in patients that need to undergo intensive care but escape the deadly consequences of the infection can be measured as newly diagnosed diseases of interest eg related to lung function and ultimately by estimates of biological age see fuellen et al 2019 moskalev 2019all sampling we suggest is amending the standard diagnostics we consider two guiding criteria for selecting the right type of samples 1 maximum expected usefulness of the samples to identify biomarkers accurately predicting outcomes of interest 2 minimum effort time cost reliability of supplies safety in taking and processing the samples needed overall we suggest that even in the current covid-19 situation simple non-invasive or minimally-invasive sampling procedures can easily be implemented these would be based on using i the remainders from the standard diagnostic swab-based sample ii a double-headed swab using one head for diagnostics iii in addition to the diagnostic swab one or more further swabs and iv dried capillary blood spot samples overall sampling methods have to be in agreement with downstream laboratory uses and of course they have to comply with the corresponding who andor local standardsthe sampling modalities for biomarker identification to be considered at time of pandemia screening are depicted in supplement 1 nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are the standard for the diagnosis of respiratory infections such as covid-19 as diagnostic testing will always be performed we strongly suggest to use remainder material from the diagnostic swab for additional analyses of interest lopez et al 2019 elegantly developed a minimally invasive sample collection protocol that allows for multiple diagnostic and research investigations including bacterial culture viral detection pcr cytokine expression pcr and 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing from a single nasopharyngeal swab cutting the tip of the swab also allowed for rna sequencing further there are a number of additional swab collection options ranging from an additional swab to a double-headed swab flocked swabs are most often used and transferred into universal transport medium utm von allmen et al 2019 dried capillary blood sampling is another easy option routinely applied for neonate screening and drug monitoring an optimized protocol for the extraction of rna from dried blood spots yielded similar transcriptome gene counts compared to rna isolated from venous blood in tempus tubes reust et al 2018 thus dried blood spots for transcriptome studies could be a viable option facilitating rna studies blood collection application onto filter paper drying transport and storage can all affect the accuracy of the analysis and comparability with blood serumplasma however handling and transport of the samples is far less problematic lim 2018 rutstein et al 2015 zakaria et al 2016 we acknowledge that sampling of whole blood may not be practical in times of a health emergency nevertheless specific measurements that require whole blood eg of circulating antibodies may still be clinically useful and then the remaining blood should be used for biomarker analyses such as transcriptomics based on circulating immune cells for all samples for investigating immunity and inflammation cytokine or related protein assays are an obvious first choice a second choice are modalities allowing unbiased gene expression measurements transcriptomicsthe most appropriate sampling workflows should be prioritized depending on a number of factors incl screening location emergency rooms specific screening centers etc availability of respective sampling materials the condition of the proband asymptomatic mild severe and the objective of the screening appropriate preanalytic sample processing is important particularly for rna analyses stellino et al 2019 even if standard tubes are used lippi et al 2019 we recommend in the short term the recording of date and time of collection and of storage and transport conditions and attention to rna stability long term uniform standards must be establishedmeasuring the host response to infectious pathogens provides a rapid but rather unspecific means of aiding in diagnosis compared to direct pathogen detection however monitoring the host response over time enables evaluation of patient response to therapy white blood cell counts and single protein or metabolomic biomarkers such as crp procalcitonin and lactate have historically been used in case of infectious and immunological diseases gunsolus et al 2019 ross et al 2019 moreover cytokines and other proteins were measured using technologies ranging from elisa to flow cytometry vazquez et al 2019 postulating that a broad assessment of host response in terms of gene expression transcriptomics will yield superior diagnostic and prognostic accuracy global changes in gene expression in response to acute infections trauma and sepsis were studied intensively sweeney and wong 2016 biomarker discovery has initially focused on whole blood or specific blood cell populations holcomb et al 2017 zaas et al 2013 but more recently samples from the respiratory tract have been used more often landry and foxman 2018 for example host gene expression profiles in nasopharyngeal np swabs and whole blood samples were investigated during respiratory syncytial virus rsv and human rhinovirus hrv infection do et al 2017 rsv infection induced strong and persistent innate immune responses and the observed rsv-induced gene expression patterns did not differ much in np swabs compared to blood in contrast hrv infection did not induce expression of innate immunity pathways as strongly and significant differences were observed between np swab and blood specimens with respect to biomarkers for outcome risk stratification whole blood transcriptomics alongside with clinical data in sepsis patients leads to a significant improvement in the prediction of 30-day mortality sweeney et al 2018 which is useful as a template for investigations in covid-19 patientsmoreover dried capillary blood spots dbs provide a minimally-invasive low-cost option since results often correspond to those derived from gold-standard venous blood samples mcdade et al 2016 dbs can be used for quantification of virus antigens rna nguyen et al 2018 and antibodies muzembo et al 2017 for studies of gene expression mcdade et al 2016 and age-dependent dna methylation knight et al 2016 multiplexing by mass spectrometry is available chambers et al 2015 and global metabolite profiles can be generated assuming stability at ambient tem  perature drolet et al 2017 large numbers of samples can be taken and stored in biobanks bjorkesten et al 2017 and be used to characterize inflammatory responses for example multiplex immuno-mass spectrometry can measure acute phase response inflammatory proteins from dsb with high precision anderson et al 2019 also allowing longitudinal analyses of inflammation markers and generating biomarker trajectories of inflammation dynamics overall swabs and dried blood have proven their value specifically for the identification of infection- and immunity-related biomarkerswe outlined how cytokine assays and transcriptomic estimates of immunity and inflammation in particular are measurable with a minimum of invasion based on swabs or dried blood towards predicting age-related outcomes regarding disease manifestation hospitalization and long-term health deterioration after respiratory infection such as covid-19 as already pointed out in the introduction aging-related processes are an important contributor to inferior covid-19 outcomes here we describe how immunity and aging are related see supplement 2 for more details in brief aging is the primary risk factor for all chronic diseases and for inferior outcomes in infectious diseases and covid-19 is no exception in people with chronic respiratory disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease this risk is attributed to inflammation of the airways dominated by cd4 t cells and eosinophils in case of asthma and by cd8 t lymphocytes macrophages and neutrophils in case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cukic et al 2012 exacerbated by respiratory infection barnes et al 2015 holgate et al 2015 the heterogeneity of responses to infections such as covid-19 depends not only on the general health condition predisposition on the genetic level and the disease history but in particular on the individual immunobiographies franceschi et al 2017b knowledge of the individual life experience surrounding ecosystem cultural habit history of natural infections vaccinations or allergies should thus additionally be collected the most important mechanisms underlying severe adult covid-19 pneumonia cases are a reduction in cd4 and cd8  t cells and a decrease in regulatory t cells as the thymus is a central lymphoid organ responsible for the release of t lymphocytes inflammaging associated with the absence or a marked reduction of thymopoiesis could be a predisposing condition that sustains the cytokine release storm observed in many older patients with severe clinical courses scarpa et al 2020 in accordance with this assumption the clinical manifestations are relatively mild in children with ageing antigen stimulation and thymic involution lead to a shift in t cell subset distribution and loss of expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as cd27 and cd28 with increased susceptibility to infections and a putatively compensatory upregulation of cytokines on the other hand reduced killing ability by t cells at an early stage after birth could explain susceptibility to sars-cov-2 in very young infants yuki et al 2020in general inflammaging immunosenescence and cellular senescence all closely related to each other fulop et al 2017 are involved in a deterioration of the performance of the immune system with age starting with an involution of the thymus fagnoni et al 2000 despite homeostatic mechanisms infection with eg cytomegalovirus then leads to repeated reactivation of cd8 cells which increases the fraction of specialized t cells and decreases the amount of naive t cells vescovini et al 2010 and to downregulation of cd28 which is an important co-stimulatory signal pangrazzi and weinberger 2020 although no cell type of the immune system has been identified that shows all hallmarks of cellular senescence some immune cells secrete several senescence-related components cytokines chemokines extracellular matrix remodelling proteases callender et al 2018 indicating that the removal of cells with a senescent like phenotype may prepare elderly people for future infections despite a protective role also described baz-martinez et al 2016 in particular the interference of oncoviruses with senescence pathways suggests that senescence may also be part of the host cell response to fight viruses and that the sasp could the recruitment of immune cells baz-martinez et al 2016 some experiments with vesicular stomatitis virus point to this possibility moreover there are indications that senescent lung cells are an ideal host target for sars-cov-2 viral infection possibly due to better conditions for replication such as enhanced protein synthesis which is also required to produce sasp inflammatory mediators sargiacomo et al 2020 there are clearly many more possible interrelationships between sars-cov-2 infection and senescence mechanisms regarding genomic instability telomere attrition impaired autophagy mitochondrial dysfunction immunosenescence and inflammation which may help to explain the increased pathophysiological responses to sars-cov-2 among older individuals mueller et al 2020 salimi and hamlyn 2020 for example two suggested host receptors for sars-cov-2 cd26 and ace-2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 are upregulated in senescent cells sargiacomo et al 2020 moreover a major cause of immune exhaustion is telomere shortening in viral-specific memory cd8  t cells mueller et al 2020 which induces cellular senescence and p38 mapk-dependent sasp callender et al 2018 this is of interest insofar as certain subtelomeric genes are upregulated in aged cells with short telomeres by a mechanism called telomere position effects over long distances tpe-old one of these tpe-old genes interferon stimulated gene isg-15 robin et al 2014 is the most significantly activated isg in response to viral infection salimi and hamlyn 2020 notably isg-15 plays a key role in the innate immune response to viral infection and inhibits viral release by blocking viral assembly sadler and williams 2008 most therapeutic considerations so far focus at blocking sasp and viral replication using substances as rapamycin and doxycycline or at the removal of infected senescent cells by senolytics malavolta et al 2020 sargiacomo et al 2020 in any case cellular senescence overlaps with immunosenescence and inflammaging and cytokine assays are a method of choice for discovering biomarkers related to inflammation immunity cellular senescence and aging whole-genome transcriptomics could enable the further unbiased hypothesis-free exploration of biomarkerswhile the majority of current efforts focus on implementing diagnostic testing capacity little attention is paid to prognostic testing eg by estimating immune or inflammation status however while diagnostic testing is of critical importance to identify and quarantine infected patients prognostic testing is equally important to allow decisions on the level of care for those that are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms but may deteriorate as described above we suggest that the association of covid-19 with old age may specifically be due to inflammaging- and senescence-associated failures of the immune system and that it is important to test this hypothesis in more detail based in particular on molecular biomarker measurements the human host response to coronaviruses in general was reviewed by channappanavar and perlman 2017 the coronaviruses sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 all trigger a strong immune response ie higher plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines in intensive care patients liu et al 2020 there are several reports describing extensive lung damage in patients infected in previous sars pandemics associated with high initial virus titers peiris et al 2003 increased mononuclear infiltration in the lungs nicholls et al 2003 and elevated levels of serum proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines wong et al 2004 thus the clinical deterioration of patients with coronavirus infections appears to result from a combination of direct virus-induced cytopathic effects and immunopathology induced by cytokine activationmost biomarker-related studies with respect to covid-19 that are currently available were done in patients not in probands undergoing screening and these studies were done based on sophisticated blood analyses not usually available in the screening situation during a pandemic we describe some examples because these studies directly or indirectly reflect the outcomes we are interested in differences in immune responses in patients with severe versus those with mild covid-19 were investigated by liao et al 2020 characterizing the lung immune microenvironment using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 3 severe and 3 mild covid-19 patients and 8 healthy controls through single-cell rna sequencing combined with tcr-sequencing monocyte-derived fcn1 macrophages were identified as the dominant cell population in the lungs of patients with severe disease and ards whereas fabp4 alveolar macrophages and clonal cd8  t cells predominated in the lungs of patients with mild disease the predominance of highly inflammatory cells points towards high cytokine activation moreover qin et al 2020 analyzed peripheral lymphocyte subsets from 452 severe and non-severe covid-19 patients severe cases had significantly lower lymphocyte counts higher leukocyte counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratios as well as lower percentages of monocytes eosinophils and basophils most of the severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines finally for patients with severe covid-19 monitoring the inflammation and immunity status may suggest treatment options such as immunosuppression by steroids intravenous immunoglobulin selective cytokine blockade or jak inhibition and specific biomarkers may be increasing ferritin decreasing platelet counts erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the hscore mehta et al 2020 monteleone et al 2020 overall the role of immune and inflammation-related mechanisms underlying disease protection and progression in covid-19 need further elucidation and inflammaging-related processes are a promising focus see also the introduction based on the analysis of local mucosal and systemic immune responses following our suggestions in section 2 and supplement 1we suggest that all covid-19 test probands that are able to give informed consent shall participate in systematic surveys as motivated here it is important to record confounders and as in any analysis potential bias must be considered some confounders time-of-day can be recorded immediately while others may need to be established post-hoc ie after sampling by questionnaires asking for co-morbidity for anthropomorphic data etc data analyses shall follow standard procedures for biomarker discovery since in many cases the data are in a time-to-event format survival analyses are usually done as exemplified in some recent reviews see lee and lim 2019 wang et al 2019 in these analyses gender must be considered as a confounder and the immunobiographies of the study participants shall be considered as well of note biological knowledge about the sars-cov-2 virus is assembled at a rapid pace see httpscovidpagesunilumap
curation can be combined with other knowledge on pathways  geneprotein interaction zhou et al 2020b and be used to interpret omics data it is also important to maximize data sharing fostering open sciencetradeoffs are an issue in any biomarker discovery or validation effort they arise between maximizing the quantity versus the quality of the data in real-world versus standardized situations enabling cost-efficient yet safe measurements as described in section 2 in any respiratory disease epidemic and specifically in case of covid-19 we suggest that with highest priority swabs and dried blood shall be done based on a simple set of rules observing minimum standards to limit the influence of systematic confounders as well as random influences while still reflecting the real-world situation then if there is sufficient signal for learning biomarkers these can be expected to generalize well a specific tradeoff are biosafety issues see supplement 1any taking of samples for research purposes as well as the sharing of patientproband data must be subject to ethical approval by an institutional review board and of informed consent from the side of the patient nevertheless while considering all essential data protection aspects ethical approval and permission for data collection and analysis should primarily enable research promoting health for the additional sampling during screening in times of a health crisis the initial informed consent should thus be as simple as possible and be restricted to taking and storing of samples for research purposes and to processing the data needed to contact the patientproband electronically or by telephone later the actual use of the samples may then be consented after a detailed explanation of study purposes and participant rights including data protection and rights of withdrawal such post-hoc informed consent preferably obtained electronically also includes the agreements on follow-up exams see supplement 3motivated by recent pilot trials specifically of intervening into cellular senescence towards improving the health status of idiopathic lung fibrosis justice et al 2019 and osteoarthritis unity 2019 patients and given that inflammaging can be due in part to senescent cells we suggest that modulating the immune status of the elderly by reducing inflammation or removing senescent cells immune cells or cells of the lung may improve their health and resilience also in the case of respiratory infections such as covid-19 the first step towards investigating this hypothesis is the confirmation of biomarkers related to inflammaging or senescence as being predictive for the outcomes considered here such as hospitalization and long-term deterioration of lung function the latter is of particular interest in escapers that survived serious complications of the disease if biomarkers could be identified to predict their course of recovery inferior outcomes may be prevented more generally it would be possible to design biomarker-guided intervention trials where not only the choice of the anti-inflammatory andor seno-therapeutic interventions shall be guided by the biomarkers found to be most predictive but patient-specific personalized biomarker-based treatment is a conceivable option moreover as aging-related processes are at the core of susceptibility to infectious respiratory diseases in general and of the chances to cope with these any remaining sample material should be used to measure generic aging-related markers for example if there are leftovers of human dna methylation-based estimates of biological age are possible and these can help to understand how host age and viral challenge are responsible for the outcomes observed and specific mechanisms of molecular aging that are related to these outcomes can be confirmed or discovered anew in fact based on dna from buccal swabs an epigenetic clock was already established eipel et al 2016 finally it was demonstrated in phase-2 studies although not confirmed in a recent phase-3 study that influenza vaccination response can be improved by targeting the mtor pathway by rapalogs kaeberlein 2020 since mtor modulates cellular senescence biomarkers for predicting the reaction of the immune system to mtor inhibition may be valuable for vaccination research also for covid-19gf is supported by the bmbf fkz

hong et al 2020 and li et al 2019viruses have only become known as a microorganism involved in cap in the adult immunocompetent population in recent years available data show that a virus is the only microorganism isolated in between 10 and 30 of immunocompetent adults hospitalized for cap and accounts for as much as 40 of cases with established etiology a bacterium as a co-pathogen of a virus can be found in association with cap mixed viral-bacterial pneumonia 1-4 and this accounts for as much as 39 of cases in which an etiological agent is identified 1-3 in these studies streptococcus pneumoniae continues to be the most frequent producer of adult cap though frequently in association with a co-pathogen especially viruses 20-40 2356 it seems logical that due to the lower sensitivity of techniques usually employed to diagnose bacterial infection some pneumonias considered to be viral will actually be mixed cap 3 this issue together with the possible isolation of viruses from asymptomatic subjects suggesting clearance of a past or current subclinical upper airway infection not related to a concomitant cap has led to uncertainty as to whether some viruses are the real cause of cap or whether they must act as a co-pathogen with a bacteria in adults 236-8 the generally accepted opinion is that viruses other than influenza rarely cause pneumonia in healthy adults 9besides individual host responses there is increasing evidence that several different causal microorganisms may trigger different inflammatory responses and levels of several markers such as white blood cells wbc c-reactive protein crp and procalcitonin pct are associated with different etiological patterns 1011 clinical signs and symptoms of bacterial and viral pneumonia are highly variable and overlap and there is no clinical or radiologic algorithm that can discriminate between the two causes of cap 12 some attempts at differentiation based on biomarkers have been made and it is now well established that crp and especially pct show higher levels in bacterial than in viral or atypical pneumonia 12-14 lack of viral pct response to viral infection is thought to be related to post-infection release of interferon which inhibits pct synthesis 15there are very few studies of mixed viral-bacterial cap that involve biomarkers the only available data concern h1n1 influenza from retrospective studies with a limited number of patients mostly in those admitted to the icu showing increased pct 16-19 and crp 1819 levels in bacterial coinfection this suggests that the biomarkers may be used as a tool for discriminating mixed cap from h1n1 viral cap the capnetz study included a large number of patients 1337 with cap of which 58 43 showed mixed etiologies however this group was heterogeneous as it included two or more typical or atypical bacteria and combinations of typical with atypical and any bacteria with a virus 10we wanted to determine wbc crp and pct levels in mixed viral-bacterial cap and wondered whether biomarkers in mixed disease showed a different pattern than in either bacterial or viral cap alonethis study received written approval from the instituto aragons de ciencias de la salud iacs review boardvenous blood samples were collected from cap patients and controls on admission to the ed within 6 hours of arrival a sample was submitted to the hematology lab for a wbc count and another sample with edta was submitted to the biochemistry lab for crp and pct assessment these latter samples were centrifuged and stored at 80c until biomarker tests were performed serum crp was measured by means of immunoturbidimetry using the highly sensitive near-infrared particle immunoassay nipia method immage 800 beckmancoulter san diego usa the assay

producers of cap haemophilus influenzae moraxella catarrhalis staphylococcus aureus etc and l pneumophila were included in the group of bacterial cap one or more typical bacteria including legionella in association with one or more virus were considered as mixed capviral cap was defined as a cap with detection of a virus and no isolation of bacteria or atypicals overall viral and bacterial was the result of adding viral and bacterial groups of cap bacterial-involved was the addition of mixed bacterial and viral and bacterial cap both positive microbiological findings and biomarker test were required to include patients in the study group figure 1descriptive analysis data are presented as n  for categorical variables and as median interquartile range iqr for continuous variables after non-normal distribution was shown as appropriate baseline characteristics of cap patients were compared among the three groups together using anova analysis or kruskal-wallis h test depending on the type of variable comparisons except for baseline characteristics were established between two different groups in order to compare the values of every biomarker between the different etiologic groups two-group comparisons were performed using the mannwhitney u-test for every biomarker the two-group comparisons performed were bacterial vs mixed bacterial vs viral mixed vs viral mixed vs overall

all statistical tests was a 2-sided p value of 005we selected 280 patients from those admitted to the emergency department due to cap after excluding those who did not meet inclusion criteria those without a comprehensive microbiological study and those with a final diagnosis other than cap on discharge a total of 185 cases were finally selected the figure 1 shows a flowchart explaining the process of enrollment of patients our final three groups were as follows 59 346 bacterial 66 385 viral and 46 269 mixed viral-bacterial cap and their main clinical characteristics are summarized in

low-pathogenicity bacteria we selected 174 patients with viral bacterial and mixed cap a biomarker search could not be performed in 3 patients and we finally included 171 61 patients in our study with both etiology and biomarkers see figure 1 of these one patient from the viral group and another from the mixed group lacked pct determinationetiological agents isolated in each group are shown in

of cases of cap with established cause excluding atypical whereas 46280 164 and 46171 269 of those of known etiology had a mixed bacterial-viral etiology this information is summarized in table 2the control group was composed of 100 subjects matched for age and sex comorbidities in this group were similar to those of cap patients biomarker levels were checked in all of them nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained in 60 of the subjects for viral searches including both pcr tests paired blood samples for serological studies were not obtained in these subjects in the control group 4

bacterial p  0027 and viral p  0005 cap and there were no differences between the latter two groups p  0614 both pct and crp showed significantly higher values in mixed group compared to overall viral

significantly higher levels in mixed cap compared to viral cap without influenza p  0019 and 0046 respectively wbc showed no differences in either biomarker table 6 crp levels were also higher in mixed involving influenza than in viral cap due to influenza virus table 7to differentiate mixed from overall bacterial and viral cap a cut-off of crp of 2595 mgdl near our median values showed a ppv of 045 95 ci 032-058 and an npv of 083 076-09with regard to pct a cut-off of 210 ngml near our median values discriminated bacterial-involved bacterial and mixed from viral cap with a positive predictive positive value ppv of 078 95 confidence interval ci 068-088 and a negative predictive value npv of 048 95 ci 038-057a large number of univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the factors associated with mixed viral-bacterial cap the final multivariate logistic regression model selected by a stepwise procedure included only one independent variable the crp that was the only independent factor associated with mixed etiology the other parameters showed no association with viral-bacterial cap after adjusting for the rest of variables table 8receiver operating characteristic roc analysis for pct to discriminate bacterial-involved bacterial and mixed from viral cap showed an area under curve auc of 0640 p  0002 the auc was 0621 p  002 for discriminating between bacterial and viral cap and 0651 p  0007 for discriminating between mixed and viral cap the crp auc for discriminating between bacterial-involved and viral cap was not significant 0579 p  0081 but there were differences between mixed and bacterial 0626 p  0027 mixed and viral 0657 p  0005 and mixed and overall bacterial and viral 0642 p  0004 table 9 see figures 3 and 4the main conclusions of our study are that biomarkers in adult immunocompetent mixed viral-bacterial cap show different inflammatory behavior than bacterial and viral cap as followsa mixed cap had similar pct levels to bacterial cap but different from viral cap and crp levels were higher in mixed than in either bacterial or viral cap table 4 pct and crp levels were higher in mixed than overall viral and bacterial group and than cap of unknown cause table 4 these differences were not associated with a different severityb pct levels above 210 ngml on admission may indicate bacterial-involved pneumonia bacterial or mixed viral-bacterial with a high probability 78 elevated crp levels was the only independent factor associated with mixed etiology and a value below 2595 mgml ruled out mixed etiology with 83 probabilityin recent years some studies have shown the importance of mixed viral-bacterial pneumonia reporting a prevalence of 4-28 of cap in adults and 11-39 of cap with known etiology 17 these wide ranges are due to different study designs and especially to the number and type of diagnostic techniques used in our study we included every test commonly used in clinical practice as well as two different pcr assays for respiratory viruses as these techniques are not standardized in order to obtain the most complete virus yield possible by following this protocol we were able to identify a very definite group of mixed pneumonia and compare it to pure bacterial and viral groupsthe importance of mixed cap has been recognized in recent years and has been clearly underestimated so far some studies have found these types of cap to be more severe than bacterial cap 2723 whereas others like our study found no differences in etiology-related severity 56 the importance of suspecting mixed cap is justified because these cases can be more severe and some of the viruses isolated can be treatedmost mixed bacterial-viral cap had pneumococcus as the causative agent and half of our s pneumoniae pneumonias were associated with viruses these data indicate that many cases of cap usually considered pneumococcal cap are in reality mixed viral-bacterial infections because viruses are not usually looked for conversely when viral pcr is used many considered as viral cap can be in reality mixed with missed bacteria 3it is true that a viral genome may be isolated from the upper airways of some asymptomatic subjects and therefore in patients with cap this may suggest previous or concomitant upper respiratory viral infection unrelated to the pneumonia a study including bal in severe cap found that a viral genome was identified in upper respiratory samples without its alveolar isolation in only 13 of cases 24 and we only identified a virus in 67 in our controls similar to other studies 4 not all authors are clear as to whether viruses other than influenza can by themselves cause pneumonia in adults or whether they must act in conjunction with other respiratory pathogens 236-8 rhinovirus was the most common virus identified in bal of patients with severe cap in a recent study 24 and our data showing a different inflammatory response of pure viral pneumonia compared with those of bacterial-viral cap also suggest that viruses other than influenza can by themselves cause pneumonia in adult patientsthere is information in the literature confirming that viral pneumonia induces a different biomarker response compared to bacterial pneumonia in fact other studies have confirmed these differences also including atypicals 11-13 the lack of pct response to viral disease seems to be due to stimulation of macrophages to release interferon which inhibits tumor necrosis factor tnf synthesis that in turn is necessary for tissues to synthesize pct 15 in our study pct levels were similar in mixed and bacterial cap and higher than those of viral cap and in terms of crp we found that mixed cap showed significantly higher levels than bacterial and viral pneumonias this biomarker was the only independent factor associated with mixed etiology the high npv for crp can help us to suspect an aetiology different than mixed bacterialviral however it is true that its low ppv and auc limit its usefulness in the clinical settingsome studies have suggested a potential role of biomarkers in differentiating pandemic influenza a h1n1 cap from its bacterial coinfection all these studies were retrospective and involved a limited number of mainly critical icu patients the largest series included 19 cases of mixed cap and found lower levels of pct 16 and of pct and crp 1819 in viral cap than mixed h1n1-bacterial cap as well as their utility in clinical practice 161819 however others showed limited sensitivity and specificity 17 we also found a serum crp higher in mixed infections involving influenza but differences could not be achieved for pct probably due to low number of our cases n  15 with the exception of influenza there is no information in adults on the behavior of biomarkers in mixed pneumonia in our study we found that the inflammatory response was higher in mixed cap compared to single bacterial and viral cap we included mixed viral-bacterial cap not restricted to the influenza virus in a homogeneous adult group of patients and both pct and crp were different in viral cap without influenza than mixed cap without influenzathe ability of crp to discriminate mixed viral-bacterial cap from bacterial cap was considered limited in children 13 and the capnetz group showed 58 cases of mixed cap in adults that included two or more typical or atypical bacteria and combinations of typical with atypical and any bacteria with virus in which pct and crp levels were tested together 10 although increased amounts of biomarkers especially pct have been associated with increased pneumonia severity 10 this was not the case in our study as we found no differences in either psi or curb56 scores among three etiological groups median crp was highest in mixed cap perhaps reflecting an increased level of systemic inflammation as has been suggested 7 it is difficult to explain with accuracy why mixed cap showed higher crp levels than both viral and bacterial pneumonias it has recently been suggested that the main etiological agents of cap present different inflammatory profiles according to their respective biomarker crp pct tnf- and il-6 response and that host-microorganism interplay may be useful for etiological diagnosis 11 our results suggest that mixed bacterialviral cap have a predominant crp response findings of investigations approaching usefulness of pct and crp for etiological diagnosis of cap are contradictory 25 this can be due at least in part to the lack of inclusion of mixed bacterialviral pneumonias in these studiesthere were no differences in wbc counts among the three etiological groupsour study is subject to certain limitations this is a study from a single hospital with a limited number of patients we obtained no lower respiratory tract samples bal for viral study and some of the nasopharyngeal viral findings may have come from concomitant viral upper respiratory infection we did not use pcr techniques for diagnosing atypical bacteria and our yield for these pathogens based in serological testing was low nevertheless our purpose was to study viruses and bacteria and atypical findings were excluded we are aware that some pneumonias classified as viral could in fact have been mixed with a bacteria that could not be identified without a quantified pcr test for bacteria finally a sequential search for biomarkers might have given us more complete information the major strength of our study is that we compared a very well defined population of mixed cap to other groups of very well defined bacterial and viral capour findings suggest a specific inflammatory profile in mixed viral-bacterial cap which is different from that of both bacterial and viral cap these findings can be useful by clinicians to include antiviral treatment especially during the influenza season and to suspect a bacterial role in the case of either symptoms suggesting virus involvement or viral isolation interestingly our results were similar when we excluded mixed influenza cases this is the first study to assess biomarkers in a group of mixed viral-bacterial cap other than influenza and compared with bacterial and viral adult cap the biomarker profile in this group is different from that of viral cap this suggests that the inflammatory response to viruses even excluding influenza is different from that in mixed cap and therefore that viruses do not always require a bacterial co-pathogen to produce pneumonia in adults this may help us better understand the true role of viruses in cap and perhaps encourage the development of effective antiviral drugs 8 despite their usefulness in some particular cases we appear to lack an

history physical findings and other ancillary medical tests are frequently similar for different causative agents and do not provide definitive discrimination 2 3 misdiagnosis of disease etiology may alter the trajectory of patient care including over and under use of antibiotics with fundamental individual and global health consequencesto aid in accurate clinical decision-making various laboratory tests are regularly requested 1 routine cultures may aid in determining infectious etiology but their utility can be limited by lengthy time to result low yield and contamination 4 molecular testing expands our capability to detect specific pathogens yet test interpretation can be confounded by pathogen co-infections and significant carriage rates of potentially pathogenic microorganisms such that molecular tests may contribute to over and under diagnosis 5 notably pathogen-based tests are inherently limited by requirement to sample the infection focus which is especially challenging in lower respiratory infections and fever without source therefore there is pressing need for new reliable and rapid testing to aid the clinician in discriminating between bacterial and viral infectionshost biomarkers hold great promise as routine diagnostic tools as this approach can overcome many of the previously described challenges 6 7 multiple candidates have been documented including traditional cellular markers eg white blood cell count wbc 2 and absolute neutrophil count anc 8 and soluble host-proteins both classical eg interleukin-6 il-6 9 c-reactive protein crp 2 1012 and procalcitonin pct 2 10 1214 and others eg human neutrophil lipocalin hnlngal 15 there are also panels of host nucleic acids in the early stages of development 1618 additionally various prediction models have been proposed that combined several markers for example the lab-score which integrates pct crp and urinary dipstick results 19 to date wide adoption of such biomarkers and prediction rules for discriminating between bacterial and viral infections has been limited by one or more of the following lack of rigorous clinical validation 7 narrow applicability to certain settings populations or clinical syndromes 20 disputed cutoffs 21 and not enough added value beyond standard-of-care 2224recently a novel host-protein signature for differentiating between acute bacterial and viral etiologies in children and adults was described 2529 this is the first diagnostic test based on soluble host-proteins to include both viral- and bacterial-induced biomarkers tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand trail which exhibits induced expression in viral infections and reduced expression in bacterial infection interferon gamma-induced protein-10 ip-10 that is induced to a greater extent in viral infections and lesser extent in bacterial infections and crp which exhibits the opposite pattern to ip-10 the diagnostic performance has been validated in two double-blind studies 27 28 with sensitivity 867 95 confidence interval 758931 and 938 95 ci 878998 and specificity 911 95 ci 879936 and 898 95 ci 856940 respectively in these former studies a head-to-head comparison of its diagnostic performance with other biomarkers at multiple cutoffs and prediction rules was lacking in patients with respiratory infection both upper and lower and fever without sourcein this study focusing on two prevalent clinical syndromes that are difficult to diagnose as bacterial or viral we compared the diagnostic performance of the host-protein signature not only to commonly applied crp and pct as documented previously 25 27 28 30 but also in a head-to-head manner to multiple cutoffs of il-6 hnl and several prediction rules that have been reported as candidate tools for aiding the clinician in discriminating between bacterial and viral infectionbiomarker measurements were performed on specimens from defined subpopulations of the curiosity study

unanimously assigned viral by the expert panel 57 were given antibiotics indicating a 33 rate of antibiotic overuse the potential of the host-protein signature to reduce antibiotic use was estimated by considering the following ratio number of patients given antibiotics who were assigned viral by unanimous expert diagnosis and viral by host-protein signature n  50number of patients given antibiotics who were assigned viral by unanimous expert diagnosis n  57 according to this calculation the host signature has the potential to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use by 88 the same estimation performed separately for children and adults indicates overuse rates of 30 and 46 respectively and a potential of the host-protein signature to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use by 87 and 91 respectively in these subgroups similarly the same estimation performed separately for hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients indicated overuse rates of 39 and 28 respectively with the potential of the host-protein signature to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use by 78 and 97 respectively in each clinical settingin this study we compared the performance of individual and combined biomarkers and prediction rules to a recently developed signature comprising three host-proteinstrail ip-10 and crpin patients with respiratory infections and fever without source we observed that the host-protein signature yielded significantly superior performance for diagnosing bacterial versus viral infections in these patients as compared to the individual biomarkers crp pct wbc anc il-6 and hnl and their currently used combinations the signature exhibited the highest total accuracy 940 95 ci 912968 with sensitivity of 935 95 ci 891979 and specificity of 943 95 ci 907980 the only diagnostic test to show promising utility both for ruling-in and ruling-out bacterial infections the signature also outperformed five prediction rules including the lab-score and exhibited robust performance across age and various pathogens in particular even in cases of adenovirus infection which can trigger bacterial-like responses leading to misdiagnosis as bacterial infection 37 the host-protein signature maintained performance this study adds valuable information to previous studies introducing the host-protein signature in its head-to-head comparison to classical and other eg hnl biomarkers and to prediction rules its detailed analysis of performance across specific pathogens and its estimation of the potential for this new diagnostic tool to reduce antibiotic use in two clinical syndromes that are challenging for the clinician to managethe biomarkers and prediction rules in this comparative study were selected based either on the breadth of their current clinical use andor their potential for application in real clinical settings for discriminating between bacterial and viral respiratory infections and fever without source 6 7 we did not examine nucleic acid panels as although several research studies support promising performance for differentiating between bacterial and viral infections 1618 currently there are no affordable technologies for measuring multiple rnas in a quantitative manner in under an hour restricting application of nucleic acid biomarkers at point-of-care in contrast proteins are amenable to affordable user-friendly measurements within minutes which is essential for broad application of a new test for aiding clinicians to discriminate between bacterial and viral infections a point-of-care platform for measuring the host-protein signature in 15 min is currently under developmentit is noteworthy that a unique feature of the host-protein signature as compared to the other biomarkers and prediction rules examined in the present study is the inclusion of viral-induced biomarkers the diagnostic value of integrating bacterial and viral biomarkers is supported by a proof-of-concept study of 54 febrile emergency department patients that reported improved discrimination between microbiologically confirmed bacterial and viral infections when trail ip-10 and pct were combined into a model as compared to any of the individual biomarkers 38 in the case of the signature it is likely that the distinctive expression dynamics of the three proteins in response to bacterial versus viral infections 2528 contributes to its superior performancea key strength of this study is application of a comparator method based on rigorous expert adjudication one of the challenges in evaluating tests to distinguish bacterial from viral infection is the lack of a gold standard for etiologic diagnosis 36 to address this many studies employ microbiological confirmation as a comparator method which has the advantage of being well-established and reproducible but the notable disadvantage of restricting the cohort to a small proportion of patients with likely enrichment for easy to diagnose cases indeed there were 153 patients in the subgroup for whom there was clinically relevant microbiological confirmation of the unanimous expert diagnosis as compared to 314 in the full cohort of patients with unanimous expert diagnosis although employing expert panel adjudication has the potential to introduce errors this comparator method has the fundamental advantage of encompassing a greater proportion of patients and consequently a study cohort that more closely resembles the real clinical setting especially relevant for respiratory infections and fever without source that can be hard to diagnose at presentation other key strengths are the breadth of index tests compared and that their cutoffs were defined before data analysisa limitation of the study is that the study population was restricted to secondary care medical centers much antibiotic overuse occurs in outpatient settings particularly for respiratory infections 39 and since the prevalence of viral infections is typically higher and the severity of disease likely lower future studies of the signatures diagnostic performance in physicians offices are planned furthermore immunocompromised patients and oncology patients were excluded from this study populations that would benefit greatly from such a test and merit future study another limitation is that the expert panelists were provided with crp wbc and anc data introducing a potential incorporation bias when evaluating the diagnostic performance of any tests that incorporate one or more of these biomarkers including the host-protein signature however since clinicians often employ crp wbc and anc as part of routine care to decide the etiology of infection it was reasoned that the comparator method may be impaired if the panelists were blinded to these data notably despite the largest potential incorporation bias the individual biomarkers crp wbc and anc did not yield superior performancein conclusion in this study the host-protein signature comprising trail ip-10 and crp exhibited the highest diagnostic performance for distinguishing between bacterial and viral etiologies in patients with respiratory infections and fever without source the need for such tests is highlighted by the finding that the treating physicians prescribed antibiotics to one third of the viral-infected patients in the present study cohort the host-protein signature identified 88 of these cases as viral infections and therefore has the potential to reduce antibiotic overuse considerably importantly because both sensitivity and specificity are over 93 this potential may be fulfilled as the clinician can be confident about the signatures performance at both ruling-in and ruling-out bacterial infection this said the test is not a substitute for physician education on clinical diagnosis and judicious antibiotic use the host-protein signature is intended for use in conjunction with clinical assessments and other laboratory findings as an aid to differentiate bacterial from viral infection future health and economic outcome research is warranted to evaluate the impact of incorporating the signature into routine patient carecoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 remains pandemic with considerable morbidity and mortality similar to sars in 2003 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is usually considered to be an acute process confined to the lungs and results in a high mortality rate in covid-19 patients however accumulating evidence points to myocardial injury as a covid-19-related complication with an incidence ranging from 72 to 1212 notably an american college of cardiology clinical bulletin has highlighted the cardiac implications of covid-19 it suggests that patients with underlying cardiovascular disease face higher risks and recommends them to be triaged and treated with priority3 however according to limited information on cardiac complication of covid-19

to analyse the risk factors for in-hospital mortality by multivariable cox regression the values of these biomarkers were transformed into categorical variables according to roc cut-off points ck-mb myo and ctni and the 99th percentile upper reference limit pct c-reactive protein and nt-probnp in model 1 figure 4a and all biomarkers remained as continuous variables in model 2 figure 4b respectively in multivariable cox model 1 ck-mb  22 ngml hazard ratio hr 662 95 confidence interval ci 2491759 p  0001 ctni  0026 ngml hr 456 95 ci 1281628 p  0019 and nt-probnp  900 pgml hr 312 95 ci 125780 p  0015 were risk factors figure 4a in multivariable model 2 age hr 104 95 ci 100107 p  0025 crp hr 101 95 ci 100101 p  0044 myo hr 100 95 ci 100101 p  0001 ctni hr 125 95 ci 107146 p  0004 and nt-probnp hr 100 95 ci 100100 p  0045 were risk factors for death figure 4b

although this study included a large number of patients it has several limitations first some data such as echocardiography and dynamic measurements of myocardial markers were lacking from clinical examinations of patients in isolation ward or icu because of the logistical restriction at the onset of these emerging infections in wuhan second due to the existence of either unmeasured or unknown confounders the causes of death or myocardial injury could be underestimated by analysis of multivariable regression third because the clinical observation of patients is still ongoing at the time of manuscript submission most patients have not reached the clinical endpoint finally for the total number of 2 350 000 patients with covid-19 worldwide the current sample size is still small in order to avoid statistical bias as much as possible data from multiple centres and larger samples are warranted to further confirm the results of the present studymyocardial injury is not an uncommon complication among patients with severe covid-19 especially among those who die ctni and ck-mb levels predict risk for in-hospital death and myocardial injury is associated with senior age inflammatory response and cardiovascular-related comorbiditiesboth viruses and bacteria may colonize the nasopharynx np and oropharynx op without causing infection advances in molecular testing and microbial antigen detection with enhanced sensitivity may allow detection of colonization or postinfectious shedding of respiratory pathogens without clinical significance 10 respiratory viruses such as the herpes viruses including epstein-barr ebv 11 herpes simplex virus hsv 12 and cytomegalovirus cmv 13 are associated with chronic intermittent asymptomatic nucleic acid sheddingstreptococcal carriers are at low risk to spread gabhs to close contacts they do not require antibiotic treatment and are at minimal risk for development of rheumatic fever 14 streptococcal carriage may persist for many months and frequently poses diagnostic challenges when a symptomatic viral uri develops in carriers the low predictive value of throat swabs relates to the prevalence of carrier rates 15 and neither the blood agar plate culture nor the rapid antigen tests can accurately differentiate individuals with true gabhs pharyngitis from gabhs carriers 16 studies have shown that only 4050 of the children with gabhs isolated from the upper respiratory tract who presented with symptoms of tonsillitis or pharyngitis demonstrated a systemic immune response 1618when group a strep is cultured from the op and associated with an antibody response characteristic of a true infection crp will elevate 8090 of the time 15 17 conversely patients with a negative initial crp test seldom show a rise in antibody titer 19 and 96 have crp 10 mgml 20 the high carrier rate of gabhs and false-positive diagnoses may contribute to the apparent failure rate of approximately 20 with penicillin therapy 21 valkenburg et al have shown that an antistreptococcal antibody titer is more accurate than a throat culture in predicting therapeutic outcome 22differentiation of infection from colonization requires the demonstration of an antibody response however proving this immune response is time-consuming and may lead to false-negative results following appropriate antibiotic therapy 23 a study by ivaska et al 3 showed that in 83 patients presenting with pharyngitis there was no significant difference in the mean initial serum antistreptolysin o aso levels between the gabhs and non-gabhs patients and only 5 patients showed a 2-fold aso increase in paired serum samples of the 5 patients with an antibody response 3 of them were gabhs positive 1 of them was gcbhs positive and 1 was negative for streptococci by throat culture conversely blood mxa levels were found to be elevated in 79 of patients with viral pharyngitis and remained low in 90 of patients with gabhs without virus detection 3mxa expression in peripheral blood is a highly specific marker for viral infection 2430 mxa is an intracellular blood protein that mediates cellular resistance against a wide range of viruses and elevates in the presence of most acute active viral infections including influenza a and b respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenzaviruses epstein-barrr herpes simplex cytomegalovirus adenovirus coronavirus rhinovirus and metapneumovirus infections however it is not specific to a particular type of virus 7 2527 30interferons ifns are naturally occurring proteins that are an important part of the hosts innate defense mechanisms and are released in response to viral infections 7 31 the mxa gene is expressed in blood mononuclear cells or locally in tissues and expression is upregulated exclusively by type i ifns 25 26 the mxa gene does not respond to other cytokines such as il-1 or tnf- neither type i ifn nor mxa elevates in healthy patients or those presenting with bacterial infections 7in most cases of acute viral infections type i ifn and mxa are released into the peripheral blood detection of interferons in serum is difficult and unreliable mainly due to their short half-life 30 in contrast mxa has a long half-life of 23 days low baseline level of less than 15 ngml and a fast induction time of 12 hours after infection 32 the low basal levels of mxa protein in tissues its exclusive expression by type i ifns and its relatively long half-life make it an excellent biomarker for systemic ifn- production in viral infectionsrecent studies show that other viral biomarkers such as tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand trail and ip-10 are less effective than mxa at differentiating viral infection trail and ip-10 show area under the curve auc specifically for viral infection of 072 and ip-10 of 072 33 other studies further support the superiority of mxa as a biomarker for identifying a viral infection especially in uri 3 24crp is a nonspecific acute-phase protein that increases during an inflammatory process such as a severe infection the normal crp serum concentration is less than 13 mgl and can rise above 500 mgl in the presence of severe inflammation or infection 7 a high crp level generally indicates bacterial rather than viral infection and can also be used to assess disease severity a systematic review of acute rhinosinusitis showed that a crp of less than 10 mgl provided evidence against bacterial sinusitis and a crp greater than 20 mgl showed evidence supporting bacterial sinusitis 34 calvino et al showed that crp elevated above 20 mgl in nearly all cases of gabhs ensuring that a clinically significant infection would less likely be missed but could not differentiate viral from bacterial infection 35 similarly putto et al found that in examining 62 children with positive bacterial cultures 89 showed a crp elevated over 20 mgl consistent with a clinically significant bacterial infection 36typically bacterial infection stimulateselevates crp while having no impact on mxa levels 29 crp elevates within 46 hours of infection doubles every 8 hours and peaks at approximately 3650 hours 37 although less common than bacterial infection viral pathogens such as adenovirus parainfluenzavirus influenza respiratory syncytial virus epstein-barr virus herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus can raise crp levels significantly over 20 mgl 7 2427 30 38 therefore a test system that utilizes both crp and mxa simultaneously can potentially differentiate viral infections from bacterial disease as the elevated crp from a viral infection would also be associated with an elevation in mxa whereas the mxa levels would be normal in bacterial infectionpct is the peptide precursor of calcitonin a hormone that is synthesized by the parafollicular c cells of the thyroid and regulates calcium homeostasis standard reference values of pct in adults and children older than 72 hours are usually 015 ngml or less 39 in response to inflammation associated with bacterial endotoxin or inflammatory cytokines pct elevates within 26 hours peaks at 1224 hours and has a half-life of 2540 hours 37 40 higher procalcitonin levels in patients with bacterial sepsis are associated with a greater likelihood of severe sepsis septic shock and decreased survival 40 colonization or carrier states without a systemic host response do not significantly raise procalcitonin levels 41 procalcitonin levels fall with successful treatment of either severe bacterial infection or noninfectious inflammatory stimuli 40uris tend to cause modest elevations in pct 42 43 using a lower pct threshold of 01 ngml in association with polymerase chain reactionconfirmed bacterial cultures of common oral pathogens such as gabhs or atypical pathogens such as chlamydophila or mycoplasma would suggest a true active bacterial infection higher pct cutoffs of 015025 ngml could be used in association with growth of typical bacterial colonizers or in association with a negative bacterial culture to suggest active bacterial infection in patients without another confirmed source of infection such as a viral infection 8 40 the pct response to viral infections and noninfectious inflammatory stimuli such as autoimmune disease and chronic inflammatory processes typically do not exceed 075 ngml 44 45 branch et al found that 17 of viral infections had a pct 025 ngml 46 at low concentrations 10 ngml pct is inadequate by itself to differentiate viral from bacterial etiology 8 47 48crp and pct levels do not correlate consistently with each other but in primary care patients with uri each has moderate predictive value for clinical outcome 49 both crp and pct have been shown to elevate in infectious pharyngitis however 42 43 crp is more sensitive and pct is more specific for detection of bacterial tonsillopharyngitis 43 in most acute respiratory infections including uri antibiotic therapy based on either biomarker alone has led to reduced antibiotic prescriptions without increased morbidity 5054numerous studies have delineated the utility of crp in antibiotic stewardship specifically decreasing antibiotic prescriptions for patients with respiratory tract infections 5053 in europe a crp 20 mgl is recommended in the pneumonia guidelines by the national institute for health and care excellence nice as a trigger for prescribing antibiotics 50 using this crp threshold there was no statistically significant increase in patient consultations emergency visits or adverse outcomes 50 in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 studies in primary care including 10 005 patients crp testing led to significantly reduced antibiotic prescribing at the index consultation without increasing morbidity 51the effect of crp testing on the outcome of patients in general practice was evaluated in a recent randomized clinical trial a total of 179 patients were included 101 in the crp measurement group and 78 in the control group results suggested that crp testing in patients with acute cough may reduce antibiotic prescribing and referral for radiography without compromising outcome 55 similar results have been demonstrated in identifying patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd exacerbations who do not need antibiotic treatment 56clinical trials using pct to guide antibiotic therapy for patients with acute respiratory tract infections have shown that a biomarker-driven algorithm can decrease antibiotic prescribing significantly and without an increase in adverse events or treatment failures 5762 pct-guided antibiotic stewardship reduced initial antibiotic prescription rates by 40 to 50 in patients with lower respiratory infection lri presenting to the emergency departments 61 70 to 80 in ambulatory patients presenting to their general physicians 63 and reduced total antibiotic exposure in community-acquired pneumonia by 40 to 50 64 in a single-center randomized controlled study a significant reduction in antibiotic use in patients hospitalized with severe acute exacerbations of asthma was shown utilizing an algorithm of pct measurements in this study withholding antibiotic treatment did not cause any apparent harm 65several clinical studies have verified that high mxa protein levels are strongly correlated with a systemic viral infection while elevated crp levels are more closely associated with bacterial disease 3 7 8 2426 simultaneously performing crp and mxa should predictably increase sensitivity and specificity for identifying bacterial diseasecombining mxa detection with a marker specific to bacterial infection such as crp could be of greater predictive value and allow more reliable differentiation between viral and bacterial infections than using a marker of bacterial infection alone 7 8 24 a high mxa with or without an elevated crp would strongly suggest a viral infectious process and the absence of a bacterial infection 24 unlike the common occurrence of incidental identification of multiple pathogens in the op or np true active co-infection that leads to a systemic viral and bacterial immune response is not common in uri 1 8 if both viral and bacterial pathogens are identified an associated pct 075 ngml or crp 100 mgl may support a diagnosis of a true co-infection result others have suggested that a defined ratio of crpmxa would optimize differentiation between a viral and bacterial infection 3rapid crp tests are shown to promote more prudent use of antibiotics in primary care and have led to a 19 reduction in antibiotic prescriptions 66 a prospective multicenter cross-sectional study of adults and children with febrile uris evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a 15-minute single-use disposable immunoassay that includes both crp and mxa febridx rps diagnostics sarasota fl 8 during a multicenter us-based study that enrolled 370 patients 205 symptomatic patients with uri and 165 asymptomatic patients from 10 clinical sites including academic emergency departments and community care centers demonstrated a 97 negative predictive value npv for bacterial infection also the use of crp independent of mxa would have led to overtreatment of 38 of viral infections 8 the pattern of results from test systems with crp or pct combined with mxa may assist health care professionals to identify an immune response to a suspected viral andor bacterial infection and greatly enhance antibiotic stewardship in the outpatient setting 7 24 this was recently demonstrated in a febridx study of 21 children and adults mean age  46 years that evaluated the use of mxa plus crp as a guide for outpatient antibiotic management therapy was altered in 48 and unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions were reduced by 80 without any adverse effects 9the value of inpatient antibiotic stewardship is embraced by many professional societies such as the idsa and the center for disease control and prevention cdc there are presently several recommendations guidelines and requirements from some licensing organizations that continue to be updated as diagnostics evolve and outcome measurements improve 67 the current focus on inpatients fits well with existing hospital surveillance programs and the ability to identify multiply drug-resistant organismsinpatient stewardship is driven in part by modern microbiology which is often not available or impractical in the outpatient setting outpatient stewardship is also critical but more difficult to implement according to the cdc and american college of physicians up to 50 of antibiotic courses prescribed in the outpatient setting are inappropriate and completely unnecessary this equates to more than 3 billion in direct costs additionally billions of indirect costs include 1 antibiotic-resistant illnesses 2 antibiotic adverse events and 3 secondary infections with clostridium difficile diarrhea 1a major obstacle to effective outpatient antibiotic stewardship and appropriate antibiotic prescribing is the difficulty in accurately defining the microbial cause of respiratory infections especially distinguishing viral from bacterial etiology this diagnosis is even more challenging when rapid tests identify bacterial pathogens present in the carrier state additionally attempts to differentiate bacterial from viral infections using only the history and physical findings are inaccurate about one-half of the time 64 patients may also have symptoms mimicking an infectious process which is actually caused by hypersensitivity especially rhinovirus and coronavirus acting directly as allergens eliciting an ige elevated response this may lead to low-grade fevers and exacerbation of reactive airway disease in predisposed patients with a history of underlying allergies atopy asthma or copd 68 69 lastly patient expectations of therapy present another challenge to overcome in the outpatient setting in 1 study up to 50 of parents had a previsit expectation of receiving an antibiotic 70 when patients expect or demand antibiotics they are more likely to receive them even though patients satisfaction may not be affected by prescribing of antibiotics 53one approach to improve appropriate outpatient antibiotic use is to supplement the history and physical examination with point-of-care tests for selected biomarkers biomarkers such as crp pct and mxa respond differently to the host immune response and can help distinguish viral from a bacterial infection including noninfectious causes of symptoms at low levels crp and pct are sensitive but not specific to bacterial infection while at high levels both crp and pct become more specific to bacterial infection although pct and crp are not specific enough to differentiate a viral from bacterial infection these biomarkers in combination with mxa substantially improve the differential diagnostic accuracy 7 9 24 the combined interpretation of mxa with either crp or pct dramatically improves both sensitivity and specificity for differentiating a viral from bacterial infection 7 8a rapid point-of-care test that measures both crp and mxa is available in europe and canada but not currently in the united states utilization results of the febridx test in outpatient clinical practice are impressively encouraging including diagnostic accuracy and positive impact on appropriate antibiotic prescribing 9 the 97 npv reduces the clinicians fear of missing a serious bacterial infection and supports watchful waiting while the ability to demonstrate tangible results at the office visit can relieve patient pressures for antibiotic prescriptions 9 a recent survey estimates that 85 of us primary care clinicians currently use a rapid strep test and 60 use a rapid flu test oftentimes in the same patient 71 a rapid point-of-care test utilizing detection of both mxa and crp without any required ancillary reader equipment would likely reduce the need for rapid strep and flu testing and provide direct cost savings while reducing indirect costs related to the cost of unnecessary antibiotics themselves adverse events and potential resistancein summary it is critically important that antibiotic stewardship rapidly move into the outpatient setting diagnostic algorithms based solely on history and physical are historically inaccurate for many common outpatient syndromes incorporating point-of-care testing with a combination of biomarkers such as crp and mxa can be extremely useful as an important adjunct to traditional methods further studies should be directed toward the delineation of biomarker utility in the outpatient settingthe coronavirus covid-19 is perhaps the greatest challenge of mankind in the twenty-first century the development of the disease its transmission and the increased mortality in a number of countries make it imperative to develop treatment but also to protect health care and society from the transmission of the diseasetherefore remote control of the disease including diagnosis early quarantine and follow-up is essential artificial intelligence can contribute to the above perspectives recent studies claim to achieve precise results regarding the automatic detection of the disease from thoracic x-ray scans 13 although the research is limited due to the absence of large scale image data the first results are encouraging and necessitate further investigation and researchalthough the diagnosis is increasingly becoming a rapid process the financial issues arising from the cost of diagnostic tests concern both states and patients especially in countries with private health systems or restricted access health systems due to prohibitive pricesduring the first months of 2020 there has been an increase in publicly available patient data including x-ray images possible patterns and knowledge mined from the x-ray scans may constitute a possible pipeline for the diagnosis of covid-19he development of deep learning applications enables the researchers to perform a rapid and deep analysis on the x-ray scans deep learning is a combination of machine learning methods mainly focused on the automatic feature extraction and classification from images while its applications are broadly met in medical image detection segmentation and classification tasks machine learning and deep learning have become established disciplines in applying artificial intelligence to mine analyze and recognize patterns from data reclaiming the advances of those fields to the benefit of clinical decision making and computer-aided systems is increasingly becoming nontrivial as new data emerge 4deep learning for pattern recogtition in images is a learning method wherein deep convolutional neural networks cnn are utilized for automatic mass feature extraction achieved by the process called convolution 5 each layer involves a transformation of the data into a higher and more abstract level higher layers ie deep layers of portrayal enhance parts of the information that are significant for segregation and smother unimportant attributes due to the unlimited parameters mined during this process several methods have been proposed to achieve dimensionality reduction such as pooling 5motivated by the recent and relative research in this study we focus on circumventing two vital issues arisen in the detection of covid-19 from x-ray scans the first issue is related to the methodology of the experimental setups in essence the researches have demonstrated that the detection of covid-19 is achievable but this conclusion derives from an analysis based on incomplete data he models proposed are powerful in classifying images between only three classes viral and bacterial pneumonia covid-19 normal this unfortunately does not demonstrate the existence of a clear fingerprint of the coronavirus in x-ray images firstly due to the insignificant database size and secondly due to the fact that the fingerprints of other pulmonary diseases have not been compared the second issue is related to the flaws of deep learning and is often referred to as the issue of interpretability 6 in short the algorithm is not transparent thereby a radiologist cannot supervise and know which factors or indices were utilized by the model to reach to a decisionto further evaluate the methodology of deep learning we perform an experiment utilizing six of the most common pulmonary diseases including that of covid-19 in this way the capabilities of the method in distinguishing between the various diseases is evaluated besides the dataset of the particular experiment is significant including approximately 450 cases of covid-19 to contribute to the latter referred issue ie the interpretability we perform three different experiments altering the mining methods to inspect the variance of the extracted features specifically the state-of-the-art cnn called mobile net v2 is employed to extract features from the images in three different ways as follows a training from scratch b feature extraction via transfer learning or of-the-self-features and c hybrid feature extraction via fine-tuning those methods are explained in sect 22due to the absence of a complete x-ray dataset containing not only common pneumonia or other diseases but also cases of diagnosed covid-19 the final dataset of this experiment is a combination of x-rays corresponding to common pulmonary diseases recorded during the last years and confirmed covid-19 cases recorded from january 2020 to march 2020the results of the present research further enhance the research to date in particular it is highlighted that with the strategy of training from scratch the cnn succeeds in mining significant image features discovered solely in the particular x-ray images based on these characteristics features 88 accuracy in classification of the relative diseases and  99 accuracy in diagnosis of covid is achieved this may prove that these features are biomarkers and need further analysis as they may be gene or other signaturesfor the creation of the dataset the research focused on obtaining x-rays corresponding to confirmed cases infected by the virus sars-cov-2 through extensive research a collection of 455 well-visualized confirmed pathological x-ray images was created the final collection includes selected x-rays from a repository created by dr cohen 7 and publically available medical image repositories such as the radiological society of north america rsna radiopaedia and the italian society of medical and interventional radiology sirm the latter association released a publically available covid-19 dataset 8 which was also incorporatedto train and evaluate the classification method in more complex conditions a collection of conventional bacterial and viral pneumonia x-ray scans was added to the dataset this collection is available on the internet by kermany et al 9 a selection of 910 related x-ray images which were randomly selected was incorporated into the datasetit is impossible to investigate the performance of any classification method in detecting the covid-19 disease unless other pulmonary diseases are incorporated for this reason the final dataset includes selected x-ray scans corresponding to other pulmonary abnormalitiesthe national institutes of health nih x-ray dataset was exploited which is referred to as nih dataset for the particular experiment and comprises 112120 frontal-view x-ray images of 30805 unique patients with the text-mined fourteen disease image labels 10those images are extracted from the clinical pacs database at the national institutes of health clinical center in america the corresponding diseases were mined from the associated radiological reports using natural language processing the labels contain fourteen common thoracic pathologies include atelectasis consolidation infiltration pneumothorax edema emphysema fibrosis effusion pneumonia pleural thickening cardiomegaly nodule mass and hernia this dataset is significantly more representative of the real patient population distributions and realistic clinical diagnosis challenges than any previous chest x-ray datasets the dataset comes with annotated metadata info consisting of several risk associated factorsa significant limitation of this dataset is the labeling policy which may raise some concerns more specifically the medical reports were analyzed by an automatic text-mining model which assigned the corresponding labels according to its text-mining procedure however as the authors claim there would be some erroneous labels but the natural language processing nlp labeling accuracy is estimated to be  90 10for the particular experiment the following disease cases were selected a pulmonary edema b pleural effusion c chronic obstructive pulmonary disease d pulmonary fibrosis the selection was based on the significance and frequency of those diseases analytically 293 images representing the pulmonary edema 311 images representing the pleural effusion 315 images representing the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and 280 images representing the pulmonary fibrosis were randomly chosen from the collectionthe x-ray images were rescaled to a size of 200  200 for the images of different pixel ratios and to avoid distortion black background of 200  200 pixels was added to achieve a complete transformation low contrast images or images containing parts of the whole thoracic x-ray scan were excludedduring the training process slight augmentations were applied to the images data augmentation is mandatory to generate the necessary diversity aiding to the generalization capabilities of the cnns 11 specifically the images are randomly rotated by a maximum of 10 and randomly shifted horizontally or vertically by a maximum of 20 pixels towards any direction in this way the cnn learns to be robust to position and orientation variancethe present collection of data faces some limitations which have to be mentioned firstly a relatively small sample of covid-19-infected cases is incorporated besides this sample may derive from patient cases with severe symptoms the analysis of which was mandatory cases with slight symptoms are missing from the current public collections which is due to the policy of protecting people and society who have mild symptoms of the disease and are immediately quarantined without further examinationsecondly the pneumonia incidence samples are older recorded samples and do not represent pneumonia images from patients with suspected coronavirus symptoms while the clinical conditions are missingthirdly further data related to demographic characteristics and other potential predisposing or risk factors are not available and this impedes a holistic approach and examination beyond the medical imagethere are currently major techniques that successfully employ cnns to medical image classification by extracting features as follows a training the cnn from scratch b employing a pre-trained cnn which is called transfer learning 12 and c a hybrid method which also a transfer learning method while it adopts the former strategies by tuning the trainability of specific layers of the cnn this method is called fine-tuning 13the first strategy may be adopted either by developing a novel cnn architecture or by employing the architecture of a successful cnn in this study we employ a state-of-the-art cnn architecture to follow each of the strategiesthe second and the third strategy are means of transfer learning transfer learning is a machine learning method wherein a model developed for a specific task is reused for another task there are two categories to perform the transfer learning ie the of-the-self feature extraction and fine-tuningthe off-the-self strategy is an approach utilizing the weights of the convolutional layers which are defined from the source task the initial training of another domain without re-training the network 14 extracting such features is usually fast and this approach requires only the addition of a classifier to perform the classification of those features with respect to their significance in the particular taskthe fine-tuning strategy involves utilizing a network initialized with pre-trained weights and partially re-training it on the target task in the context of deep learning fine-tuning a deep network is a common strategy to learn both task-specific deep features and retain the methodology to extract global features met in every image such as shapes usually the fine-tuning strategy allows more trainable weights at the top of the network ie the final steps due to the fact that those convolutional layers extract more abstract and high-level information compared to the first layers wherein local features are learned in the particular experiment we gradually allow more layers to be trainable by defining six experimental cases referred to as fine-tuning eg 11 where the number in the parenthesis corresponds to the number of trainable convolutional blocksfor the classification task the state-of-the-art cnn called mobile net 15 was employed mobile net has been recently utilized for the same classification task by apostolopoulos 3 in their work the authors demonstrated the superiority of mobile net in reducing the false negatives for the detection of covid-19 compared to other famous cnns besides this cnn introduces a fewer number of parameters compared to other cnns which makes it appropriate for swift trainingthe mobilenet 15 model is based on depthwise separable convolutions 16 which is a form of convolutions transforming a conventional convolution into a depthwise convolution 16 and a 1  1 convolution which is commonly known pointwise convolution 16 this procedure reduces the number of parameters drasticallyto the top of the mobile net v2 a global average pooling 17 layer was added which drastically reduces the issue of overfitting 18 the extracted image features are inserted into a neural network of 2500 nodes to distinguish between the irrelevant and the significant ones to further aid to the overfitting reduction the weights of each feature are normalized utilizing a batch normalization layer 19 while we independently zero out the 50 of the outputs of neurons at random via a dropout layer 20 an overview of the method is illustrated in fig 1the intention of the particular study is not only to achieve a high classification accuracy but to achieve this by training the cnn from scratch this strategy is preferable to transfer learning to evaluate the significance of the features extracted from the precise images while it is not depending on features already learned by the pre-trained model the initial training of which was performed utilizing non-medical imagesbased on the results the extracted features may be evaluated to conclude that they may constitute real image biomarkers related to various diseaseswe performed a set of three different experiments employing the same cnn mobile net v2 but altering the learning strategy the following strategies are evaluated a transfer learning with of-the-self features b transfer learning with fine-tuning and c training from scratch which in this experiment is a latent form of the transfer learning since we only borrow the architecture of the mobile net and not the learned parameters the experiments were performed utilizing a single gpu setup nvidia geforce rtx 2060 super using the keras library 21 and tensorflow 22 as backendthe training and evaluation procedure was performed with ten fold-cross-validation during this procedure the dataset is randomly split to ten folds nine of which are utilized for training the model and the remaining fold is hidden and used to test the performance and the confidence of the predictions after the training this process is repeated in a way that every fold is utilized as the test set this increases the computational cost but enhances the significance of the result the final accuracy is obtained by calculating the mean accuracy derived from each testing foldthe metrics based upon which the evaluation of the performance is made are the overall 7-class accuracy and the accuracy corresponding to the 2-class classification covid-19 vs non-covid-19besides to focus on the performance of covid-19 detection the following values are recorded a correctly predicted covid-19 cases true positives b correctly predicted non-covid-19 cases true negatives c incorrectly predicted covid-19 cases false positives and d incorrectly predicted non-covid-19 cases false negatives based on those values the sensitivity and specificity of the test are calculated by the following equations1documentclass12ptminimal

class imbalance issue the most reliable metric is that of the 7-class accuracy while given that this accuracy is high the second most vital metric is that of specificity this is due to the importance of correctly identifying the actual non-covid-19 cases true negativesin table 1 the accuracy sensitivity and specificity of the first strategy are given the reader should recall that the 2-class accuracy refers to the case where the labels are covid-19 and non-covid-19 besides the sensitivity and the specificity refer to the 2-class measurementdue to the class imbalance the metric of specificity was approaching 100 and was not mentioned in table 1 as it is not a meaningful measurement when reaching those values the same issue is valid for the 2-class accuracy but was mentioned in table 1 for comparisons the confusion matrix for each class is presented in table 2the confusion matrix corresponding to the covid-19 class vs all the classes is presented in table 3based on the results it is confirmed that the particular strategy is not effective in extracting useful features to distinguish possible underlying information from the x-rays related to the covid-19 disease besides a bias towards the non-covid-19 cases is observed in table 3 which makes the strategy not appropriate for the particular taskin table 4 the accuracy the sensitivity and the specificity of the second strategy are given the reader should recall that several adjustments for fine-tuning are tested in the particular section which are discussed in sect 22 the number defining each experimental case refers to the number of blocks made trainable during the experiment eg fine-tuning 3 corresponds to 3 trainable blocks starting from the top of the cnn the reader should also recall that the values for the accuracy are the mean values of the accuracies obtained at each fold from the tenfold-cross-validation procedureas it is observed in table 4 the strategy of fine-tuning obtains different results this is explained by the fact that we gradually allow more layers to be trainable thus approaching close to the strategy of training from scratch which obtains the best results as it is presented in sect 33 hence the confusion matrixes are not provided due to insignificance and limitations of spacein table 5 the accuracy sensitivity and specificity of the specific strategy are presentedin table 5 it is observed that training from scratch outperforms the other strategies in terms of every metric obtaining a remarkable 2-class accuracy of 9918 and a high 7-class accuracy of 8666 the reader should recall that 2-class accuracy refers to the effectiveness of distinguishing the covid-19 cases from every other case including both abnormal and normal cases in table 6 the confusion matrix for the 7-class task is presentedseveral outcomes are to be highlighted in table 6 firstly out of 455 covid-19 cases 443 cases were correctly identified while only 2 cases were mistakenly classified as normal secondly out of the 1341 normal cases only 1 case was mistakenly identified for the rest of the pulmonary abnormalities there is a diversity which may derive from the fact that the different pathogens embody seals that are difficult to distinguish from the x-rays and confuse the cnnthe confusion matrix corresponding to the covid-19 class vs all the classes is presented in table 7the classification obtains an excellent trade-off between the corresponding true positives false positives true negatives and false negativesthe particular research focuses on discovering possible image biomarkers from x-ray images these biomarkers may be significantly related to the covid-19 diseasewhile deep learning extracts a massive amount of high-dimensional features from images it is possible that some of those features behave as actual image biomarkers the reader may be confused by the difference between a feature and an image biomarker therefore we briefly describe the difference between them a feature is a specific characteristic of an image either well-defined in the literature or yet to be defined as to its importance with deep learning it is possible to extract millions of related features the extracted features importance to the specific task is questionable the majority of those features may be irrelevant to the desired outcome or the desired subject of study and are rejected by the automatic classification performed after the convolutional layers of a cnn the biomarkers are quantitative markers of confirmed significance and are not limited to the image features 23 generally the ability of deep learning for image biomarker extraction is questionable due to the issue of the interpretabilitythis study suggests that it may be possible to discover new reliable biomarkers from x-ray images due to the fact that a high classification accuracy was achieved since the cnns and the neural networks lay on the evaluation of millions of parameters to classify the significant features some of those features may actually be image biomarkers leading to a reliable result this horizon in to be investigated in future research possibly exploring other approaches such as radiomics 24ne factor that underpins the conclusion mentioned above is the comparison between the various image feature mining strategies in particular it is demonstrated that those strategies do not mine the same features this can be easily interpreted since with strategies of transfer learning with of-the-self-features and transfer learning with fine-tuning the ability of the cnn to extract significant features depends on factors related to the initial training the initial training was mandatory to be performed on images of a completely different nature due to the absence of large-scale data however despite the fact that the latter strategies have excellent performances in other medical image classification tasks 12 25 in the particular experiment they were underperforming this may suggest that with the training from scratch essential features related to the pulmonary abnormalities have been mined which may constitute relevant biomarkersin future studies some issues of the present study can be circumvented a more in-depth analysis in particular requires much more patient data particularly those suffering from covid-19a more promising approach for future studies would concentrate on identifying patients infected by covid-19 but showing mild symptoms although those symptoms may not be visualized correctly on x-rays or may not be visualized at allit is of vital importance to establish models capable of distinguishing between a more significant numbers of pulmonary diseases possibly including that of sars also despite the fact that the appropriate treatment is not determined solely from an x-ray image 26 an initial screening of the cases would be useful not in the type of treatment but in the timely application of quarantine measures in the positive samples until a complete examination and specific treatment or follow-up procedure are followedthe contribution of this work is twofold firstly low-cost rapid and automatic detection of the covid-19 disease was achieved utilizing a significantly large sample of several pulmonary infections it was demonstrated that the various infections may be distinguished by a computer-aided diagnostic system utilizing deep features extracted by deep learning methods this strategy may be beneficial for medical-decision assisting tools to provide a second opinion in challenging cases it could be also applied to achieve an intact first assessment of the likelihood of disease in patients with either suspected or no symptoms besides the advantage of automatic detection of covid-19 from either medical image lies in the reduction of exposure of nursing and medical staff to the outbreaksecondly the study suggests that future research should be conducted to investigate the possible behavior of the extracted features as biomarkers since there is sufficient evidence based on the particular results the three training strategies were employed to evaluate the significance of the extracted features of each strategy the strategy of allowing the deep cnn to learn new characteristics and features from the specific images resulted in an excellent performance over the other approaches wherein features are extracted based on mined knowledge from non-medical images or images unrelated to pulmonary diseases this underlines the uniqueness of the extracted features and marks them as possible biomarkerssevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 emerged in wuhan china in december 2019 and was declared pandemic by the world health

and eb collected data and built the database md pc lb eb and fb conducted the data analysis and interpretation of results all authors drafted and revised the papersrespiratory infection is a common reason among children for seeking care 1 the majority of respiratory infections in children are caused by viruses 2 nevertheless viral and bacterial infections are hard to distinguish clinically causing many children with viral infections or self-limiting bacterial infections to receive unnecessary antibiotic treatment which contributes to the development and spread of antibiotic resistance 34 there is a need for new biomarkers that better distinguish viral infections from antibiotic-requiring bacterial infections in children presenting with clinical community-acquired pneumonia cap and that assist health care workers in decision making and improving the rational use of antibiotics 5c-reactive protein crp procalcitonin pct and white blood cell wbc count are the most commonly used inflammatory markers in clinical practice for the management of children with suspected cap 67 there is increasing evidence that pct is superior to crp as a screening test for serious bacterial infection given the favorable kinetics including a more rapid response to inflammation 8 however neither of the biomarkers have been proven to be reliable in differentiating between mild or moderate bacterial and viral cap 910 a wbc count of 15000l has been suggested as a cutoff to differentiate between viral and bacterial etiologies however critically ill patients with neutropenia will not have an increased wbc count and certain viruses such as influenza and adenovirus can elicit a strong immune response with a high wbc count greater than 15000l 11 neither is a complete blood count reliable in differentiating between bacterial and viral cap in children 6 to date most biomarkers used in clinical practice have been selected for their ability to identify serious bacterial infections and there is a need for novel biomarkers that can reliably detect viral infections 12myxovirus resistance protein a mxa is an intracellular protein that is upregulated upon activation of the antiviral defense system increased blood mxa has been reported to be specific for viral infection 13-15 there is a commercially available rapid diagnostic test febridx that qualitatively detects mxa and crp at cutoffs of 40 ngml and 20 mgml respectively the test has been reported to have 85 2934 sensitivity and 934 183196 specificity to rule out a bacterial infection in patients adults and children with febrile respiratory infection 16 however no studies have focused on mxa in children with cap it was previously shown that virus-positive asymptomatic children had lower mxa levels as compared with virus-positive symptomatic children with respiratory symptoms 14 as current viral real-time polymerase chain reaction pcr testing of upper respiratory specimens ie the routine method for diagnosing respiratory tract infections is complicated by frequent asymptomatic detection mxa has the potential to facilitate the interpretation of viral pcr positivity in terms of clinical relevance in children with cap 17defining etiology in childhood cap is complex 18 until recently our conception of cap etiology has largely relied on early lung-aspirate studies from the 1970s to 1980s 19 vaccination against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae type b the 2 major causative agents in childhood cap has been introduced in most parts of the world during the last two decades coinciding with a global decrease in childhood cap mortality 20 this has also contributed to a shift in the etiology of cap 2122 other important factors include a globally improved socioeconomic and nutritional status a sharp decrease in the incidence of measles and the emergence of hiv 5 recently new cap etiology studies including the large-scale pneumonia etiology research for child health perch study have been conducted mostly with a low-income country focus 21-24 these have pointed toward an underestimation of viral and mixed viral-bacterial etiologies which is likely explained by the aforementioned shift in etiology but also by the recent advances in viral diagnostics 25 moreover bordetella pertussis and bordetella parapertussis the causative agents of whooping cough have been associated with cap 2126 these bacteria are highly contagious and can cause severe disease particularly in infants 27 recent studies have reported an increasing incidence of b pertussis and there have been several deaths in previously healthy infants associated with whooping cough in sweden over the last 10 years 2829 consequently there is a need for new updated studies on cap etiology in various settingscurrent treatment options with antivirals for respiratory viruses are limited however there are several new antivirals that are being developed 30 and furthermore there is a value in diagnosing viral infections to predict the clinical course and infectivity and to give confidence to withhold the prescription of antibiotics real-time pcr is a sensitive molecular-based method that is currently considered gold standard for the detection of respiratory viruses in children with respiratory tract infection 25 nevertheless as pcr usually has to be run in central laboratories and requires complex instrumentation the turnaround time can be long and the test results are rarely used for decision making regarding treatment at the point of care there are currently several new antigen-based point-of-care tests for respiratory infections on the market one is the multianalyte point-of-care antigen detection test system maripoc respi arcdia international oy ltd that uses a 2-photon excitation assay technique to detect 10 different respiratory viruses influenza ab respiratory syncytial virus rsv adenovirus bocavirus coronavirus human metapneumovirus hmpv and parainfluenza virus piv 1-3 31 the advantage of the test is that it gives a preliminary result of strongly positive samples already after 20 min and a final result including negative results within 2 hours which potentially allows for immediate treatment considerations in children the maripoc respis sensitivity for rsv and influenza virus has been reported to be as high as 90 as compared with pcr but the sensitivity for less common respiratory viruses such as hmpv and piv and the newly included coronavirus and bocavirus has been insufficiently investigated 3233recombinase polymerase amplification rpa is a nucleic acid amplification technique that does not require thermal cycling an rpa-based point-of-care test could combine the advantage of high sensitivity with short turnaround time an rpa-based test using a paper-based vertical flow microarray technique is currently being developed by our partners at the science for life laboratory scilifelab 34-37 as the test reaction is carried out at room temperature it is an interesting method for resource-limited settings where the need for new diagnostic tests is particularly high 3839studies on the long-term outcomes of radiologically confirmed bacterial cap have indicated that the disease is associated with later development of asthma and decreased lung function 4041 however most of these studies have followed children who were born more than two decades ago and the risk might therefore not generalize to a modern setting given the reported shift in etiology of pediatric cap 42 hence there is a need for new studies of long-term complications from pediatric cap such as the development of asthma and the risk for future respiratory infectionsin summary there is a need for 1 assessing the diagnostic accuracy of mxa as a biomarker for viral childhood cap 2 new studies on clinical cap etiology in children 3 evaluating the antigen-based point-of-care test maripoc 4 evaluating a novel rpa-based point-of-care test developed at scilifelab and v assessing long-term complications from cap including the risk of developing asthma and the risk for future respiratory infectionsthe overarching aim of the trial of

calculation we focused on the assessment of mxa levels in cases with viral cap as compared with cases with bacterial capcontrols study i overall 2 power calculations were made 1 for viral cap versus bacterial cap and 1 for viral cap versus controls the following assumptions were made 1 a difference in mxa level of 500 gl between the groups was considered clinically relevant 2 a standard deviation of 1000 and 300 was assumed in cases with viral cap and bacterial capcontrols respectively based on previous studies on mxa 1314 using an alpha level of 05 2 sided at an 80 power with an additional 20 to account for nonparametric testing and multivariate analyses 42 children in each group viral cap bacterial cap and controls would be needed to ensure that enough of the included cases would fulfill the study definitions for viral and bacterial cap the proportion of children with viral and bacterial cap trend definition was calculated in our previous study that assessed swedish children with x-rayverified cap 47 by doing this the prevalence of viral and bacterial cap was estimated at 45 and 14 respectively hence 300 cases and 42 controls would be needed to ensure sufficient collection of cases with viral and bacterial cap respectively we also would like to compare viral cap cases with controls testing positive for 1 or more viruses by pcr in our previous study 354 of asymptomatic children tested positive for 1 or more viruses hence to include a sufficient number of virus-positive controls we aim at including 300 cases and 120 controls in the trend studya clinically relevant difference in mxa levels will be compared between cases with viral and bacterial clinical cap as well as between cases with viral clinical cap and controls using appropriate statistical methods according to the number and distribution of data points sensitivity and specificity for different respiratory viruses with maripoc respi and the novel rpa-based test will be calculated as compared with real-time pcr the difference in asthma prevalence and the difference in the number of hospital-requiring respiratory infections between cases and controls as well as between cases and the general child population will be assessed after 3 7 and if deemed necessary 10 years data will be presented with 95 ci and a p value of 05 will be considered significantthe study will be conducted in accordance with the latest version of the declaration of helsinki and the fundamental principles of respect for the individuals article 8 right to self-determination and to make informed decisions articles 20 21 and 22 regarding participation in research both initially and during the course of the researchwe estimate that the benefit of knowing more about viral respiratory infections with the aim of improving diagnostics of cap overweighs the discomfort for the individual study participant in terms of extra sampling for all the participating children a minimal reduced amount of blood will be collected and accordingly the analysis of pct and crp will not routinely be performed in control children for the following reasons 1 data on these biomarkers in the controls are not necessary for the study objectives 2 to get a sufficient amount of blood for running these analyses it would require a larger lancet andor additional punctures and 3 these children would likely not have been subject to capillary puncture were they not enrolled in the study results from point-of-care tests will be provided to guardians and treating physicians other test results will not be provided as they will be analyzed in batches and thus not influence management written informed consents will be collected from the guardians by the study nursephysician before sampling to ensure confidentiality for the participants samples will be given a study id and results will only be presented at a group level data of personal identities will be stored in a password-protected data file at sachs children and youth hospital and will only be available to the study researchers good clinical practice and good laboratory practice will be followed the study was approved by the regional ethical review board in stockholm ref 2017958-31the study was approved by the regional ethical review board in stockholm in june 2017 ref 2017958-31 a pilot study was performed from june to august 2017 to evaluate the study protocol from a logistical and methodological point of view overall 6 out of 9 invited cases and 1 out of 3 invited controls were included valuable information was retrieved during the pilot study which has led to alterations and improvements in the recruitment process the questionnaire and other study documents as well in the logistics and handling process of the samples enrollment of study subjects started in november 2017 results are expected by the end of 2019the trend study aims to improve the differential diagnosis of bacterial and viral etiology in children aged below 5 years with clinical cap presenting at an emergency unit in a tertiary pediatric hospital in sweden this is the first study of children with clinical cap that evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of mxa as a biomarker for viral cap previous studies on mxa have shown promising results on the role of mxa as a biomarker for viral infection but have been smaller in size 14 or have included more heterogeneous groups of study subjects 131516 the trend study aims to add further information on the role of mxa as a marker to improve the interpretation of viral pcr positivity and to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections with a specific focus on children with cap further aims are to validate the findings from recent pediatric cap etiology studies including the epic and perch studies as well as to assess the long-term complications of pediatric cap 21-24one major weakness in the studies of diagnostic biomarkers in pediatric infectious diseases is the lack of a reliable gold standard for the microbiological diagnosis 549 the gold standard for assigning bacterial etiology has traditionally been the detection of bacteria in cultures from normally sterile sites lung blood and pleura however as sampling from the lungpleura is infeasible in most cases and blood cultures have limited sensitivity this approach is of little use in clinical studies of cap 5 previous studies assessing the performance of diagnostic tests in terms of distinguishing bacterial infections from viral infections have used either an independent expert panel or a laboratory-radiological-based approach to classify disease etiology 12-15 both approaches have their advantages and limitations using a strict microbiologically confirmed diagnosis as the reference has the advantage of high specificity but the generalizability of the findings is hampered as the majority of children in clinical practice will not have a clear microbiologically confirmed diagnosis in addition for a diagnostic test to be useful it is more important to distinguish between etiologically less clear cases of respiratory infections rather than to identify the school book examples of bacterial and viral infections in the trend study we chose a more pragmatic approach favoring generalizability for microbiological accuracy however given that doctors in expert panels rely on microbiological and biochemical findings we reasoned that it still would be more stringent to create an algorithm for the classification of etiology in the trend study a diagnostic algorithm has been created a priori to serve as the reference based on the current evidence for the classification of cap etiology detection of rsv hmpv influenza virus and piv has in previous case-control studies been highly associated with cap furthermore these viruses appear to be rarely detected in asymptomatic individuals and hence detection will be considered to be a definitive indicator of etiology 2122475051 for other respiratory viruses as well as for the atypical bacteria m pneumoniae the clinical significance of pcr positivity is less clear owing to frequent detections in asymptomatic children 1752-55 for that reason pcr positivity will not be considered enough for establishing etiology virkki et al reported that a crp level of more than 80 in children aged less than or equal to 2 years and more than 120 in children aged 2 to 5 years was specific 85 for bacterial etiology whereas a crp level of less than 20 was specific for viral etiology 78 56 these cutoffs will be used to aid in the definition of probable bacterial and viral infections in less clear cases hence detection of viruses other than influenza rsv hmpv and piv will be considered as viral infections only if the crp value is less than 20 given that adenovirus has been associated with high crp this rule will not be applicable for adenovirus 11 however adenovirus detections will not be considered in the strict algorithm as asymptomatic detection of the virus is common 17 finally given that crp levels depend on the disease duration and to avoid false-negative test results ie low but rising crp values an additional criterion of reported fever duration of more than 24 hours will be applied in the trend study when considering crp levels 45 as discussed above there is no optimal reference standard for the classification of cap etiology neither clinically nor in research however we believe that much is to be gained if we use an algorithm instead of an expert panel the decisions taken by expert panels differ between different studies over time and between different settings when using an algorithm this can be controlled for we look forward to comments and inputs on our algorithm so that together we can develop it furtherthe who criteria for clinical cap lack specificity and will result in the inclusion of a significant proportion of children who will not have true cap including children with bronchiolitis and asthma 57 to improve the specificity of the who criteria for clinical cap a rapid-acting bronchodilator will be administered to children with wheezing and chest indrawing as suggested by the perch study team 43 other clinical parameters from the perch study will also be included and used for further subanalyses 43conducting research in the pediatric emergency department is difficult 58 high patient flows and long waiting times create a stressful environment for all personnel categories motivating nursesdoctors to spend the extra time and effort it takes to recruit patients is therefore challenging continuous educationinformation about the research project interpersonnel teamwork nurse and doctor and incentives are all key success factors recruitment of healthy controls in this age group is an obvious challenge as the sampling blood and nasopharyngeal sampling causes discomfort to the child therefore attempts have been made to include patients who will undergo elective hand surgery and thereby be sedated during the sampling certain clinical parameters can be deceptive if not recorded correctly which is a potential source of bias in children where peripheral oxygen saturation and heart rate are measured continuously data will still only be recorded at certain time points when the children are at resttranscriptomic studies have shown promise in differentiation between different infectious agents but currently require advanced instrumentation with a long turnaround time and are hence more suitable for an intensive care unit setting than for routine testing at pediatric emergency units 59 however given the complexity of the host immune response elicited by respiratory pathogens it is possible that a single biomarker will not be sufficient to accurately differentiate between viral and bacterial cap however mxa could be valuable in a rapid combination test of biomarkers and selected microbiological testing if it proves to be specific for viral cap such commercial combination point-of-care tests of inflammatory biomarkers are already being developed and some such as febridx and memed bv have shown promise 1560improved near-patient differential diagnosis is a prerequisite for rational antibiotic use and decreasing unnecessary antibiotic treatment furthermore easier identification of the pathogens causing acute respiratory infections makes it easier to advise guardians to care for their sick children and for better disease surveillance in the society hence the findings from the trend project can be an important step toward the improved care of children with clinical cap at this stage the methods are developed and evaluated in a swedish context but might have wider implications for example to resource-limited settings where the need for similar tests is even higher than in a high-income context such as swedenviral infections cause significant morbidity and disease including cancer immunosuppression and death often infections are not diagnosed until symptoms appear and in several cases this may be years or decades after the initial infection the ability to diagnose infection or cancer before the appearance of symptoms would be of critical importance for effective treatment proteomic analysis of serum has been proposed as a means of diagnosing infectious disease andor the early diagnosis of cancer there have been some recent exciting findings in the proteomics of the host or pathogen and the use of standard mass spectrometric technologies has enabled many physicians and scientists to examine more closely the pathological and biological questions that can only be answered using proteomic approaches therefore in this chapter we will discuss some recent findings on the proteomics of dna and rna viral infections that are associated with clinically important diseases in humans including human cytomegalovirus hcmv herpes simplex virus hsv epsteinbarr virus ebv human immunodeficiency virus hiv hepatitis b and c hbv and hcv respectively and adenovirus as well as the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sarshcmv is the largest member of the human herpesviruses after initial infection hcmv remains in a persistent state with the host 2 immunity against the virus controls replication although intermittent viral shedding can still take place in the seropositive immunocompetent person 2 as replication of cytomegalovirus in the absence of an effective immune response is central to the pathogenesis of disease complications are primarily seen in individuals whose immune system is immature or suppressed by drug treatment or coinfection with other pathogens 3 estimates of the coding capacity of hcmv range from 160 open reading frames orfs to more than 200 orfs 4 recent studies using ms to determine the viral proteome suggest that the number of viral proteins may be even greater than previous estimates 5 analysis of proteins from purified hcmv virion preparations has indicated that the particle contains significantly more viral proteins than the previously known 71 hcmv virion proteins twelve of the identified proteins were encoded by known viral orfs previously not associated with virions and 12 proteins were from novel viral orfs 6 therefore new protein markers including hcmv tegument and various cellular structural proteins enzymes and chaperones are now serving as biomarkers for hcmv infection and as possible drug targetsother herpesvirus members have also been explored for the presence of possible biomarkers ebv is a ubiquitous member of the herpesvirus family that is associated with a variety of lymphomas and lymphoproliferative diseases 7 it encodes a multitude of genes that drive proliferation or confer resistance to cell death 8 infection of human b lymphocytes with ebv induces proliferative b-lymphoblastoid cell lines lcls recently proteomic profiles of three lcls were analyzed comparatively at the early and the late passages of cell culture the phosphoprotein stathmin was identified and expression significantly decreased with immortalization of lcls 9 stathmin is critically important not only for the formation of a normal mitotic spindle upon entry into mitosis but also for the regulation of the function of the mitotic spindle in the later stages of mitosis and for the timely exit from mitosis 9 in another study using standard matrix-assisted laser desorptionionizationtime-of-flight maldi-tof methods 20 ebna2 target proteins were identified 11 of which were c-myc dependent and therefore most probably associated with proliferation of the host cell 10 these findings further stress the role of ebv viral proteins namely ebna and lmp in disease pathogenesis interestingly when ebv-infected cells were treated with the drug 5 -azacytidine azca demethylating agent that induces the expression of silenced genes ie the p16 tumor suppressor gene21 polypeptides were down-regulated while 14 showed increased expression many of the induced proteins were involved in energy metabolism organization of cytoskeletal structures protein synthesis or cell viability 11 therefore the effect of drugs that activate silenced tumor suppressor genes and their proteomic profile following treatment is of considerable interestfinally an important herpesvirus to consider is hsv hsv types 1 and 2 are ubiquitous viruses that cause infections in human populations throughout the world the clinical manifestations of hsv infections are varied ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening illness in neonates and immunocompromised hosts 1213 hsv-1 infection induces severe alterations of the host translational apparatus including the phosphorylation of a few ribosomal proteins and the progressive association of several nonribosomal proteins to ribosomes 14 15 16 using a proteomics approach it was shown that vp19c vp26 and icp27 associated with ribosomal proteins 17 specifically immediate early icp27 protein associated with the cellular translation initiation factor poly a binding protein pabp eukaryotic initiation factor 3 eif3 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4g eif4g in infected cells resulting in the stimulation of translation of certain viral mrnas and inhibiting host mrna translation 18 another study has shown that approximately 50 cellular and viral proteins associate with the hsv-1 icp8 single-stranded dna-binding protein some of which belong to dna repair and chromatin family members 19 implying that hsv-1 infection results in control of host cellular dna replicationrepair and gene expression machineriesproteomic analyses of rna viruses with regard to diagnosis and novel biomarker detection are also of considerable interest in the medical community for instance sars is a new infectious disease that first emerged in the guangdong province china in november 2002 20 a novel coronavirus was later identified in patients with sars the detection of the virus in these patients its absence in healthy controls or other patients with atypical pneumonia and the reproduction of a similar disease in a relevant animal model indicated that this coronavirus was the causative agent of sars sars-cov 21 interestingly the full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the identification of the virus but the pro-teome and biomarkers associated with sars are slowly forthcoming in a recent study using a mass spectrometric decision tree classification algorithm kang et al identified four biomarkers determined in the training set that could precisely detect 36 of 37 sensitivity 973 acute sars and 987 of 993 specificity 994 non-sars samples 22 a reasonably complete proteomic analysis was also performed on four patients with sars at different times of infection and a total of 38 differential spots were selected for protein identification most of the proteins identified were acute phase proteins and their presence represented the consequence of a serial cascade of inflammatory reactions initiated by sars-cov infection of significance was the level of plasma peroxiredoxin ii in patients with sars which was significantly higher in sars patients and could be secreted by t cells 23 finally while pursuing new enzyme targets another study identified 14 putative orfs 12 of which were predicted to be expressed from a nested set of eight subgenomic mrnas distant homologs of cellular rna processing enzymes were identified in group 2 coronaviruses with four of them being conserved in sars-cov these newly recognized viral enzymes put the mechanism of coronavirus rna synthesis in a completely new perspective which has opened the door for new drug targets for the treatment of sars 24the proteomes of three other rna viruses including hcv hbv and hiv-1 have also been studied hepatitis c often progresses to chronic infection in the majority of patients and is an emerging cause of viral hepatitis clinically the infection is generally asymptomatic but may present with a wide variety of symptoms cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma hcc cryoglobulinemia autoantibodies and glomerulonephritis have been strongly associated with hcv infection 25 when analyzing proteins that interacted with the hcv protein ns5a choi et al found that the cytoplasmic heat shock protein 27 hsp27 bound to ns5a was concentrated in the er 26 where drugs for hcv treatment would have easy access as opposed to drugs delivered into the nucleus chronic infection with hbv is associated with the majority of hcc using woodchucks as a model system hcc induced dramatically higher levels of serum-associated core alpha-16-linked fucose as compared with woodchucks without hcc the coupling of this model system with 2d gel electrophoresis has permitted the identification of several glycoproteins with altered glycosylation as correlated to cancer prognosis one such glycoprotein the golgi protein 73 gp73 was found to be elevated and hyperfucosylated in animals with hcc 27 finally in an effort to identify useful biomarkers for hbv- or hcv-associated hcc 60 proteins were identified which exhibited significant changes in expression between nontumorous and tumorous tissues among these 14 proteins were commonly changed in all three of the hcc types but 46 proteins showed a tendency toward viral marker specificity suggesting that the pathogenic mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis may be different according to the viral etiology of hbv or hcv 28diagnosis and treatment strategies for hcv have become extremely important as one-third of hiv-infected individuals in europe and the usa are coinfected with hcv 29 therefore defining biomarkers in coinfections after highly active antiretroviral therapy haart is currently the focus of many laboratories hiv accelerates hcv liver disease especially with the progression of hiv-associated immunodeficiency with the introduction of pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin greatly improved treatment options for patients coinfected with hiv and hcv have become available and have led to sustained virological response rates of up to 40 30 furthermore recent cohort analyses have shown that immune reconstitution induced by haart can improve the course of hepatitis c infection leading to a decline in liver-related mortality however patients with hcv coinfection are at increased risk of hepatotoxicity from haart 29 owing to the high rates of hiv and hcv coinfections worldwide new improved biomarkers and treatment strategies and guidelines for the management of coinfection remain a major goal biomarkers could include protein fingerprints of hiv-1-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages mdms after viral infection as well as hcv-infected liver cells recently 58 proteins have already been identified to be up- or down-regulated after hiv-1 infection 31the overall awareness of the importance of proteins and peptides in physiology and pathophysiology has increased dramatically over the last few years with progress in the analysis of whole genomes the knowledge base in gene sequence and expression data useful for protein and peptide analysis has increased considerably therefore the medical need for relevant biomarkers is enormous this is particularly true for many viral infections and various types of cancer where there is a lack of useful and adequate diagnostic markers with high specificity and sensitivityhowever proteomic and peptide-based techniques have evolved in recent years to simplify the search for biomarkers peptide-based technologies provide new opportunities for the detection of low-molecular-weight protein biomarkers peptides by ms improvements in peptide-based research are based on separation of peptides andor proteins by their physicochemical properties in combination with mass spectrometric detection and identification using sophisticated bioinformatics tools for data analysis therefore peptide-based technologies offer an opportunity to discover novel biomarkers for diagnosis and management of disease including prognosis treatment decision and monitoring response to therapythere are a number of critical viral infections that have dominated the research and biomarker landscape many of these findings rely on somewhat simple or off the shelf technologies that are fairly straightforward to use perhaps the simplest of these technologies is the surface-enhanced laser desorptionionization seldi technology in a study for sars detection kang et al developed a mass spectrometric decision tree classification algorithm using seldi-tof ms serum samples were grouped into acute sars and non-sars and healthy control cohorts diluted samples were applied to wcx-2 proteinchip arrays ciphergen and the bound proteins were assessed on a proteinchip reader model pbs ii the results clearly indicated an impressive accuracy for discriminatory classifiers 22 another similar study indicated that nine serum markers significantly increased and three significantly decreased in sars patients as compared to controls 32another proteinchip assay used to study hiv-1 infection showed a unique mdm protein fingerprint during hiv-associated dementia had and haart seven unique protein peaks between 30 and 200 kda were found in the had mdm samples all of which were abrogated after haart 33 a very similar study using specific proteins produced from monocytes from had patients showed a total of 177 protein peaks from 2 to 80 kda in 31 mdm lysates select protein peaks at 5028 and 4320 da separated hiv-1-infected from hiv-1-seronegative subjects with 100 sensitivity and 80 specificity 34however most viral proteomics studies to date have utilized either 2de and maldi-tof ms or lcmsms the hiv virion is composed of a lipid bilayer that surrounds the viral capsid fig 1a
 in a clever study fuchigami et al 35 studied the hiv-1lav-1 particles which were collected by ultracentrifugation treated with subtilisin and then purified by sepharose cl-4b column chromatography to remove microvesicles the lysate of the purified hiv-1 particles was subjected to 2de and stained and the stained spots were excised and digested with trypsin the resulting peptide fragments were characterized by maldi-tof ms twenty-five proteins were identified as proteins inside the virion and the acidlabile formyl group of an amino terminal proline residue of hiv-1lav-1 p24gag was determined by maldi-tof ms before and after weak-acid treatments 06 n hydrochloric acid and confirmed by postsource decay psd of the n-formylated n-terminal tryptic peptide n-formylated pro1-arg18 interestingly formylation plays a critical role in the formation of the hiv-1 core for conferring hiv-1 infectivity 35more recently the use of liquid chromatography and tandem ms lcmsms has also eased purification and recovery methods for instance varnum and colleagues utilized gel-free two-dimensional capillary lcmsms and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ms to identify and determine the relative abundances of viral and cellular proteins in purified hcmv virions and dense bodies analysis of the proteins from purified hcmv virion preparations has indicated that the particle contains significantly more viral proteins than previously known they identified more than 71 hcmv-encoded proteins and 70 host cellular proteins in hcmv virions which included cellular structural proteins enzymes and chaperones 6 another study using lcmsms for the adenovirus type 5 pro-teome found a total of 11 protein species from 154 peptides at a sensitivity of 10 copies per virus and a detection limit of 70 fmol for two proteins 36two new methods have been used recently to decipher viral proteomes a method for proteolytic stable isotope labeling was recently used to provide quantitative and concurrent comparisons between individual proteins from two different proteome pools or their subfractions using this technique two 18o atoms were incorporated universally into the carboxyl termini of all tryptic peptides during the proteolytic cleavage of proteins in the first pool proteins in the second pool were analogously cleaved with the carboxyl termini of the resulting peptides containing two 16o atoms ie no labeling the method was used to compare two virus strains adenovirus types 2 and 5 this shotgun approach for proteomic studies with quantitative capability may be a very powerful tool for comparative proteomic studies of very complex protein mixtures 37 finally the isotope-coded affinity tag icat procedure has also yielded some very interesting results for a
rather complex viral infection setting for instance proteins from human liver carcinoma cells representing transformed liver cells and cultured primary human fetal hepatocytes hfh were extracted and processed for icat chromatography proteins from hepatitis c virus-infected cells and corresponding control cells were labeled with light and heavy cleavable icat reagents respectively after the labeled samples were combined trypsinized and subjected to cation-exchange and avidin-affinity chromatographies the resulting cysteine-containing peptides were analyzed by microcapillary lcmsms using sequest and other bioinformatics software a total of 1500 proteins or related protein groups were identified in three subdatasets from uninfected and infected cells 38 collectively these results further emphasize the new targets for biomarkers and drug development for hcv infectionthe described new technologies have collectively added to our arsenal of possible biomarkers when diagnosing various viral infections however many of these markers still need to be validated using more rigorous sample methods biological and biochemical tests and more sophisticated bioinformatics tools bioinformatics tools that have been valuable for viral diagnosis and fast retrieval of dna or protein sequences include the orfer program httpwwwproteinstrukturfabrikdeorfer 2d proteome database httpproteomebtcnusedusghccm the poxvirus proteomics database httpcontact14icsucieduvirusvacciniaphp and virgen httpbioinfoernetinvirgenvirgenhtmlin this chapter we will explore the importance of proteomics in studying virushost interactions in several viral systems including hcmv kshv ebv hsv hiv-1 htlv-1 and hcv we will also describe the methods that have been employed to study viral disease progression using several techniques including 2de lcmsms seldi and protein microarraysfollowing gradient purification of virions lcmsms was used to identify the components of the hcmv virion 6 the results were verified by coupling high-accuracy mass measurements with lc and ft-icr fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ms fifty-nine proteins were identified including 12 proteins encoded by known hcmv orfs not previously known to reside in virions the classes of proteins identified included capsid proteins tegument proteins glycoproteins and 12 proteins involved in dna replication and transcription additionally 12 more viral polypeptides were identified that had not been previously characterized 6using the intensities in the ft-icr spectra the relative quantities of the virion proteins were determined indicating that 50 of the virion was composed of tegument proteins 30 were capsid proteins 13 were envelope proteins while 7 were undefined proteins these undefined proteins are likely to be cellular proteins that are incorporated into the virion host cellular proteins were detected by comparison with peptides predicted from a human-fasta database there were 71 cellular proteins identified to be associated with the hcmv virion they included cytoskeletal proteins proteins involved in translation control and several signal transduction proteins 6 the identification of cellular proteins involved in translation and signal transduction as components of the hcmv virion suggests that these proteins may have a function in the initiation of viral gene expression or inducing an environment that is suitable for hcmv infectionkshv has only been fully sequenced in the last 10 years 44 and therefore not much is known about the composition of the virus particle nealon et al 41 used sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis page and western blotting to identify the major capsid and scaffolding proteins as components of isolated virions they then used ion trap ms to identify three additional components of the virion as orfs 62 26 and 65 this study however was limited and unable to identify all components of the infectious virus zhu et al used a more comprehensive approach to identify virion components extracellular virions were purified by double gradient centrifugation sds-page revealed 3040 protein bands whose identity was determined by in-gel trypsin digestion followed by lc and ms both peptide masses and peptide sequences were produced by tandem ms msms and used to determine protein identity the isolated proteins included five capsid proteins eight glycoproteins six tegument proteins and five other kshv orfs twenty cellular proteins were also identified and as seen with hcmv these included cytoskeletal proteins signal transduction proteins as well as heat shock proteins 45 similar results were seen in the study by bechtel et al 40 however fewer proteins were identified in this study as a single 75 sds-page gel was used to separate virion proteins zhu et al 45 used three sds-page gela 412 gel a 38 gel to separate proteins larger than 50 kda and a 12 gel to separate proteins smaller than 50 kda these studies underscore the need for good separation methods to be able to identify all proteins in a virus particlethe epsteinbarr virus ebv is a b-cell lymphotropic herpesvirus that induces a usually asymptomatic infection and is carried by more than 90 of adults however ebv is the causative agent for burkitts lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma and is involved in a number of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids-associated lymphomas ebv can induce immortalization of b cells in vitro to generate lymphoblastoid cell lines lcls a model for the carcinogenic potential of ebv lcls are latently infected with ebv they maintain the virus as an extrachromosomal episome and have limited viral gene expression the latently expressed proteins are the six ebv nuclear antigens ebnas 1 2 3a 3b 3c and -lp and three latent membrane proteins lmps 1 2a and 2b of the latently expressed proteins ebna2 and lmp are required for transformation induced by ebv 46 characterizations of cellular proteins associated with ebna2 or proteins differentially expressed in the early stages of the transformation process will be described in the following text results of these studies may lead to a better understanding of ebv-mediated transformation and the identification of cellular targets for therapya proteome database of lcls before and after transformation has been developed to identify the cellular mechanisms of virus-induced immortalization 947 2de was used to first separate proteins based on their relative charge pi and then based on their molecular weight differentially expressed proteins were digested and subjected to electrospray ionization ms proteins were identified based on their peptide mass fingerprint and amino acid sequences of peptides determined by edman degradation there were 32 differentially expressed proteins and 20 were assigned to known proteins the expression of several proteins involved in proliferation or nucleotide metabolism was increased in the immortalized cells which may result in the growth stimulation seen in immortalized cells a database of 2d gel images as well as the identity of the differentially expressed proteins has been made available to the public at wwwproteomejp2d the availability of these images and the identification of the differentially expressed proteins may prove useful to others in their analysis of ebv-infected cellsebna2 is required for transformation of lcls by ebv 4849 and induces the expression of c-myc 50 c-myc is an oncogene which drives cell proliferation however the proliferation program induced by c-myc is different than that observed by the expression of ebna2 51 suggesting that other cellular proteins and events are induced by ebna2 to mediate transformation furthermore there is limited information on the cellular targets of ebna2 to identify the ebna2-induced changes as c-myc dependent and c-myc independent ebna2 and c-myc-conditionally expressing cell lines were used and the proteome of each cell line was compared 10 proteins were separated by 2d sds-page and identified by maldi-tof ms in ebna2 expressing cells there were 20 differentially expressed proteins 12 were induced and 8 were repressed of the proteins that were induced following ebna2 expression several were involved in nucleotide metabolism protein synthesis or the control of apoptosis many of these proteins were also induced in c-myc expressing cells though six proteins were found to be ebna2 specific two ebna2-specific proteins were induced bid and ige-hrf and four were repressed annexin iv -actin gmf and af103803 furthermore analysis of the activation kinetics demonstrated that expression of ebna2 preceded that of c-myc which was then followed by the expression of nm23-h1 a nucleotide diphosphate kinase that may suppress metastasis 52 indicating that c-myc was a direct target of ebna2 10herpes simplex virus hsv has been the most extensively studied of the human herpesviruses owing to its ability to easily infect cells in vitro to produce infectious virus as with all herpesviruses hsv encodes a number of proteins for efficient viral gene expression viral dna replication and the shutoff of cellular gene transcription and translation 53 these virally expressed proteins do not function in isolation but associate with a variety of cellular and viral proteins furthermore many have exhibited multiple different functions in an effort to understand the biology of hsv and the function of its proteins a proteomics approach has been used to study a critical viral transactivator icp27 the alteration of the cellular translation machinery and components of the viral replication complex which will be reviewed herethe icp27 protein is expressed early in infection and is essential for viral replication and expression of certain early genes and virtually all late genes it is a multifunctional protein that may function with the virion host shutoff vhs protein of hsv to repress cellular protein synthesis this repression serves to direct cellular resources to the synthesis of viral proteins using immunoprecipitation of icp27 from hsv-infected cells followed by sds-page and ms several translation initiation factors were identified including pabp eif3 and eif4g 18 the interaction of icp27 with translation initiation factors may recruit these factors to viral mrna to facilitate translation of viral mrnas and also to sequester these factors away from the translation of cellular mrnashsv infection also induces ribosomal changes and it has been hypothesized that these changes may contribute to hsv-mediated translational control of host and viral gene expression 17 to identify the changes in ribosomes following hsv infection ribosomes were purified by ultracentrifugation the proteins were separated by 2d sds-page and their identities were determined by maldi-tof ms seven additional protein spots were found associated with ribosomes following hsv infection including several viral proteins vp19c and vp26components of the viral capsid and us11a tegument protein three of the seven spots were phosphorylated forms of us11 one nonribosomal protein pabp was also found associated with ribosomes the association of pabp with ribosomes increased following hsv infection 17 interestingly pabp was also found associated with icp27 in the previous study 18 although greco et al 17 did not find icp27 associated with ribosomes this is likely due to the different separation procedures used greco et al 17 used 2de and focused solely on basic proteins with a pi greater than 86 while fontaine-rodriguez et al 18 separated isolated proteins based on molecular weight together these results suggest that icp27 likely associates with ribosomes in infected cells
herpesvirus dna replication occurs in intranuclear structures called replication compartments 5455 hsv encodes seven proteins that participate in viral dna replication however it is not known what cellular proteins are involved in this process to identify cellular proteins in hsv replication compartments icp8 the hsv single-stranded dna-binding protein was immunoprecipitated from infected cells and coprecipitating proteins were separated by sds-page and identified by ion trap ms 19 greater than 50 viral and cellular proteins were identified as copurifying with icp8 the cellular proteins included those that participate in dna replicationrepairrecombination chromatin remodeling rna bindingsplicing and transcription factors several of these proteins require dna binding to associate with icp8 including several chromatin-remodeling proteins the roles of a number of interacting cellular proteins are presently unclear and further studies are needed to determine their exact roles in viral dna replicationhiv encodes a critical transcriptional activator tat which directs a cellular transcription factor ptefb to the hiv ltr to mediate transcription elongation 5657 however it has been shown that the viral genome is bound by nucleosomes that inhibit viral gene expression 5859 to determine if tat interacts with additional cellular proteins to further assist viral gene expression we used tat peptides linked to biotin to pull down all tat-associated proteins 60 additionally acetylated and unmodified peptides were also used because acetylation of tat has been attributed to alternative functions of tat 6162 we found that many more cellular proteins bound to the unmodified tat including proteins involved in modification of chromatin structure chd2 and pcaf and additional transcription factors tif1a trim family memberand scla bhlh transcription factor 60 these results indicate that tat influences viral gene expression at various levels and suggests that targeting these specific interactions may be a viable form of treatment of hiv infection and aidshiv infects several cell types during the course of infection and progression to aids in hiv-infected patients the virus establishes a persistent infection in cells of the monocytemacrophage lineage monocytes and macrophages are the first line of defense in the immune system they phagocytose and kill a range of microorganisms however little is know about how hiv persists in these cells to understand how hiv may persist in these cells carlson et al 31 used a proteinchip and seldi to identify unique protein signatures in hiv-infected monocytes obtained from different donors infection of monocytes isolated from humans was used to mimic the virushost interactions that would occur in an infected individual the proteinchips used in the study were used to partially purify samples one is a weak cation exchange and the second is a reverse-phase hydrophobic interaction chip charged proteins will bind to the cation ion-exchange chip while hydrophobic ie membrane-associated proteins will bind to the reverse-phase chip proteins bound to the chip were then analyzed by ms each peak represents a protein of a particular mass however the nature of the protein in a peak after seldi ms is unknown a different separation technology and ms are needed to determine protein identities to determine the identities of proteins up- or down-regulated following hiv infection of monocytes total protein extracts were subjected to trypsin digestion lc and tandem ms to determine sequences of tryptic peptides sequences were then analyzed against a protein bank to determine the identities of the proteins and given a score 31 the problem with this type of study is that there is no quantitative assessment of the increase or decrease in the protein levels or changes in posttranslational modifications ptm following infectionhad affects almost one-third of adults infected with hiv 63 the exact cause of dementia is not known there is significant neuronal loss but neurons are not infected with hiv 64 it has been hypothesized that hiv-infected astrocytes are critical in the development of hiv dementia and that tat is a contributor to this disease extracellular tat released from astrocytes induces cell death in neurons though tat protects astrocytes from cell death 65 to understand this dichotomy proteins differentially expressed in tat-expressing astrocytes were identified 66 total protein extracts of tat-expressing and control cells were separated by 2d gel electrophoresis and identified by maldi ms interestingly seven proteins were found to be repressed in tat astrocytes including rho gdp dissociation inhibitor and protein phosphatase 2a pp2a inhibitor many of these proteins have been shown to be involved in the biology of hiv and interact with tat 66 three proteins identified by a slot blot technique were found to be induced and included hsp70 heme oxygenase and inducible nitric oxide synthase inos 66 previously published data have demonstrated a correlation between inos and the severity of had 6768 however the role of the other differentially expressed proteins in astrocyte survival and hiv dementia will require further studythe human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 htlv-1 causes adult t-cell leukemia atl and htlv-1-associated myelopathytropical spastic paraparesis hamtsp 69 htlv-1 encodes a transactivator tax that is critical for virus replication and plays a central role in the development of atl and hamtsp 69 tax does not bind to dna directly but functions by interacting with a variety of cellular proteins 69 many proteinprotein interactions of tax have been determined by mutational analysis including creb 70 71 72 and nf-b 7072 to identify all the cellular proteins that interact with tax wu et al used chromatography 2d gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analysis of an htlv-1-infected cell line c81 73 as tax functions in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus 7074 tax-interacting proteins were identified from both cellular compartments some of the cytoplasmic proteins included small gtpases and components of the cytoskeleton while some of the more interesting nuclear proteins included components of the swisnf chromatin remodeling complex 73 the interaction of tax with many of the identified cellular proteins may be involved in the ability of tax to dysregulate cellular functions leading to t-cell transformation and leukemiahepatocellular carcinoma hcc causes approximately one million deaths a year 75 two viruses are the main causes of hcc hbv and hcv 76 77 78 although hbv is the most important cause of hcc accounting for 80 of hcc cases an effective vaccine is available 79 hcv however is a major cause of the increasing incidence of hcc in developed countries 80 and no effective vaccine is available hcc progresses after decades of chronic infection and often is at an advanced stage once it presents clinically 81 as such good noninvasive diagnostic markers are needed this will be discussed further in section 3 the focus of this section will be on the identification of cellular proteins that are induced following hcv infection or cellular proteins that interact with hcv proteinsan extensive study by wirth et al 82 analyzed normal liver tissue and hepatoma-derived cell lines by 2d gel electrophoresis and n-terminal sequencing and identified a number of proteins that were differentially expressed between normal tissue and hepatoma cell lines similar studies have been performed by others as well 8384 however these studies have used cell lines that have been in culture that may not accurately reflect all the changes seen in hcc comparison of liver tumor tissue with normal tissue would be ideal however tissue heterogeneity is an issue and could confound the results 85 until only very recently 8687 an infectious cell culture model for hcv has not been available this new model system will allow for the identification of cellular proteins that are induced following hcv infection and further the development of a treatment for hcvthe hcv genome encodes a large polyprotein that is cleaved to generate 910 proteins including the core and envelope proteins e1 and e2 and the nonstructural proteins ns2 ns3 ns4a ns4b ns5a and ns5b 88 ns5a has been proposed to act as a cofactor in hcv replication 89 as a transcription activator 90 or as an anti-apoptotic factor 91 to identify the cellular proteins that interacted with ns5a choi et al 26 coimmunoprecipitated ns5a-interacting proteins using antisera against ns5a separated them via 2d gel electrophoresis and determined their identity by ms one cellular protein was found to interact specifically with ns5a the heat shock protein hsp 27 also known as srp27 further analysis indicated that hsp27 interacted with the c-terminal domain of ns5a and both proteins were shown to colocalize around the nucleus the hsps are induced following cellular stress to protect cells from apoptosis 92 yet overexpression of hsp27 did not protect cells from hcv core-induced apoptosis as hsp27 expression could not be reduced by sirna the role of hsp27 in hcv rna replication could not be determined however due to the multifunctional nature of ns5a it is surprising that only one protein was found to interact with ns5a because an antibody to ns5a was used to coimmunoprecipitate cellular proteins the antibody used in the study may be interfering with the binding of other cellular proteins this problem may be overcome by using different antibodies to ns5a or by using a tagged ns5a and affinity chromatographythe classical proteomics platforms include 2de and ms 85 2de is employed to separate proteins in a mixture in the first dimension by their isoelectric points and then in the second dimension by molecular mass the resulting gel can be stained with a variety of protein dyes to reveal a pattern of spots in the first dimension isoelectric focusing ief is performed by using ipg strips which are based on the use of bifunctional immobiline reagents a series of 10 chemically well-defined acrylamide derivatives that copolymerize with the acrylamide matrix to generate extremely stable ph gradients forming a series of buffers with different pk values between 1 and 13 subsequently linear or nonlinear wide ipg 312 medium ipg 47 narrow ipg 4555 and ultra-narrow ipg 4953 ph range ipgs can be cast 95 we suggest the reader to refer to the review by gorg et al for more details about ipg strip rehydration sample application and ipg strip equilibration 96 the second dimension consists of using sds-page to separate proteins according to their molecular weight however the analysis of low-molecular-weight 15 kda and high-molecular-weight 150 kda proteins is challenging since there is no standard 2de system that effectively allows separation of proteins over the entire range between 5 and 500 kda a common approach is to combine several gels optimized for different molecular weight ranges instead of using a single standard 2de systemcurrent methods for the diagnosis of hcc rely on serological markers such as -fetoprotein afp 97 and certain liver enzymes as well as des gamma car-boxyprothrombin dcp 98 this type of diagnosis lacks the sensitivity to detect hcc at an early stage when therapy can be more effective to find markers of disease progression 2de was employed to resolve and compare proteins present in serum obtained from individuals infected with hbv or hcv and with varying risks for the development of hcc 99100 in several studies proteins expressed at different levels among diseased individuals as compared to those of healthy ones were identified as markers for disease progression as well as proteins with different n-glycosylation patterns 99 100 101 in another study 2d-ms was also employed to analyze altered plasma proteins due to sars-cov infection thirty-eight different plasma proteins from sars patients were identified most of which were associated with acute phase proteins 23one advantage of 2d gels is their resolution since they can resolve as many as 2000 proteins simultaneously and proteins can be detected at greater than 1 ng in one spot 96 2de is currently the only technique that can be routinely applied for parallel quantitative expression profiling of large sets of complex protein mixtures such as whole cell lysates in addition 2de produces a map of intact proteins which reflects changes in protein expression level different isoforms or ptm in fact a great advantage of this methodology is its capability to study proteins that have undergone some form of ptm such as phosphorylation glycosylation or limited proteolysis that can be detected visually on the 2de gels as they appear as distinct spot trains in the horizontal andor vertical axis of the 2de gel this is in contrast with other methods including lc-based methods which perform analysis on peptides where molecular weight and pi information is lost and stable isotope labeling is required for quantitative analysis 96although 2d gel electrophoresis is a standard technology it suffers from several problems that may limit its utility these include issues with reproducibility as well as the inability to separate hydrophobic proteins which are poorly soluble although the use of ipg strips increases the reproducibility of 2de various problems with 2d separation remain such as streaking poor focusing and the variable occurrence of gaps 85 although 2de allows for high resolution of individual spots a single spot may not correspond to a single protein since proteins can comigrate as a single spot on a 2d gel 102 furthermore 2de requires milligram quantities of protein reflecting the low sensitivity of this method to further enhance the utility of 2de-ms enrichment of samples for low-abundance proteins by improved methods is required enrichment can include prefractionation of samples as well as more sensitive detection and quantitation methods or the use of alternative methods including laser capture microdissection 103 for heterogeneous tissues in most of the studies mentioned previously the resolution problem was overcome by narrowing the ph range allowing for greater focusing however the reduced ph range in ief can lead to the elimination of a large number of proteins that may be informative comparing hundreds of protein spots across gel images taken from a large number of different samples is extremely time-consuming even with specialized software for this reason although 2d electrophoresis is a promising tool it is not very practical for clinical application the challenge is to develop this technique into a system capable of automation high throughput and high sensitivitymultidimensional lcmsms involves solution proteolysis of a complex mixture of proteins which are then fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography hplc peptides are then analyzed by tandem ms consisting of two phases in the first phase peptides in each chromatographic fraction are electrosprayed and ionized producing a mass spectrum characteristic of the molecular weight of each peptide in the sample in the second phase the first mass analyzer of the instrument is used to select a single m  h ion from the mixture and to transmit it to a collision chamber where the peptide undergoes collisions with argon atoms and suffers fragmentation the resulting fragment ions are then transferred to a second analyzer which separates them according to mass 104 the end result is a mass spectrum containing ions characteristic of the sequence of amino acids in the selected peptide when mixtures are extremely complex online reverse-phase lc is used to concentrate and separate the peptides before sequencing by ms 105 an online capillary lcmsms system consists of conventional hplc pumps transfer tubing a precolumn flow splitter a liquid junction a reverse-phase microcapillary column and a tandem mass spectrometer 106two studies have used lcmsms to identify differential protein expression in hiv- or hcv-infected cells in the first study traditional hplc ion exchange and reverse-phase columns coupled to an ultrasensitive ion trap ms was employed to identify proteins that were unique to mdm and to identify proteins present in hiv-1-infected mdm lysates by microsequencing 31 the second study used normal hepatocytes and immortalized human hepatocytes that can be induced to express the entire hcv orf the two different cell types were labeled with an isotopically light 12c for stimulated or heavy 13c for control cells reagent called isotope-coded affinity tag icat the two differentially labeled samples were then combined and digested with trypsin digested peptides were separated by strong cation-exchange chromatography affinity purified with an avidin cartridge and subjected to lc-esi-msms this study led to the identification of 2159 unique proteins that could be used as markers for disease progressionsome of the advantages include automation in sample application ability to switch columns and sensitivity as this method is able to identify proteins at very low levels 107 in addition this method has been extensively used for the determination of drugs and hormone levels in human serum 108 109 110 111 making it a promising tool for the detection of disease prognosis markers2de-based proteome analysis provides information about protein abundance at the gel level by comparing staining intensities however when peptide mixtures are analyzed directly by lcmsms techniques the original quantitative information is lost for this reason one of the drawbacks of using lcmsms is the dependence on incorporating stable isotope labeling for quantitative proteome analysis involving the addition of a chemically identical form of the analytes containing stable heavy isotopes eg 2h 13c 15n etc to the sampleseldi-tof is a proteomic technology that aims at the quantitative analysis of protein mixtures this technique relies on the use of trapping surfaces that allow differential capture of proteins based on intrinsic properties of the proteins themselves to identify proteins from crude samples without the need for an initial separation step a small amount of sample can be directly applied to a biochip coated with specific chemical matrices hydrophobic cationic or anionic or specific biochemical materials including dna fragments or purified proteins bound proteins can then be analyzed by ms to obtain either the protein fingerprints or the amino acid sequence when interfaced with a tandem msthe seldi proteinchip approach has been employed to study the protein profiles of cells infected with viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov hiv-1 and chronic hepatitis b virus infection chb 31 sars is a viral respiratory illness caused by sars-cov sars was recognized as a global threat in march 2003 after first appearing in southern china in november 2002 httpwwwcdcgov 20 current serological methods used for laboratory diagnosis of sars fail to guarantee early diagnosis since most are based on the detection of antibodies that are produced 1720 days after the onset of symptoms elisa-based antigen detection tests offer high specificity and reproducibility but they lack sensitivity on the contrary pcr-based methods including reverse transcription-pcr lack sensitivity and specificity 112 for this reason there is a need to develop a diagnostic methodology that can detect sars before the onset of the symptoms to allow for specific prevention and treatment measures for sars according to recent studies seldi-tof seems to be a promising approach to study the protein profile unique for sars sera from acute sars patients or from healthy donors were examined to identify serum marker that could distinguish sars from non-sars patients in this study analysis of spectra accurately classified 36 of 37 973 sars specimens and accurately classified 987 of 993 994 of the controls as non-sars in addition the classification algorithm successfully distinguished acute sars from other type of infections with very high precision 22 the same approach was also employed for the discovery of diagnostic proteomic signatures in the sera of patients with chb having liver fibrosis and cirrhosis results show that 30 serum proteomic features formed a unique fingerprint for fibrosis that correlated with the different stages of fibrosis from minimal fibrosis to cirrhosis 66in another study that evaluated the protein fingerprints of hiv-1-infected mdm cell lysates were directly applied on two types of protein chips weak cation exchange and reverse-phase hydrophobic interaction after washing to remove the unbound proteins bound proteins were ionized and their molecular masscharge ratio was determined using tof analysis analysis of the obtained profiles showed distinct patterns between uninfected and infected mdm 33the seldi proteinchip approach allows for high-throughput protein analysis of crude protein mixtures without the need for a separation step it is sensitive since it takes advantage of the analytical capacity of ms combined with novel surface chemistry it can provide a phenotypic fingerprint of complex mixtures sample requirements are dramatically reduced and because this approach employs ms for its readout attomolar to femtomolar concentrations of proteins can be detected additionally reproducibility is greater than that of other techniques such as 2d gels proteins at extreme pis can be identified a condition that is problematic under normal 2d gel electrophoresis conditions and finally there is a greater sensitivity and accuracy for low-molecular-weight proteins 25 kda using seldi especially below 10 kda which is particularly troublesome for 2d gelsthis method needs a very robust algorithm to ensure specificity of the profile in that it can distinguish the pattern between disease and healthy individuals with high accuracy taking into account variations in profiles between healthy individuals as well as persons with a variety of different infections at different time periods in their course of illness two additional drawbacks of this approach are the following i the identity of the proteins cannot be discovered and ii as the absolute intensity of the peaks is measured in relationship to the most abundant peaks peaks in low abundance will be masked by the more abundant ones in addition this method employs the direct analysis of tissues or biological fluids by maldi the main drawbacks of this approach are the preferential detection of proteins with a lower molecular mass and the difficulty in determining the identity of proteins owing to ptm obscuring the correspondence of measured and predicted massesa protein microarray relies on high-throughput amplification of each predicted orf by using gene-specific primers followed by in vivo homologous recombination into a t7 expression vector the proteins are expressed in an escherichia coli-based cell-free in vitro transcriptiontranslation system the protein products from the unpurified reactions are printed directly onto nitrocellulose microarrays without further purification 113this approach was used to determine the complete antigen-specific humoral immune-response profile from infected humans and animals the vaccinia virus proteome containing 185 individual viral proteins was printed on a chip after cloning and expression the chips were then used to determine the antibody profile in serum from vaccinia-virus-immunized humans primates and mice 113once it has been developed and produced a protein microarray can be a very rapid method 3 days for most of the genes to comprehensively scan the humoral immune response of vaccinated or infected individualsthe generation of a complete proteome is technically challenging one problem is the amplification of long genes furthermore expression of some proteins in heterologous systems is not efficient this technique also does not take into account ptm of viral proteins that are expressed in bacteria lastly expression in e coli might lead to folding problems of the proteinproteomic analysis of cellular protein samples began with the development of page 114 and later with the development of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis 2d-page 115 these techniques allowed for the separation of proteins based on size page or charge and size 2d-page these methods however did not allow for direct identification of these protein bands indirect methods such as western blotting with specific antibodies were required for identificationa slow and laborious process however by combining a variety of mass spectrometric methods with page identification of a larger number of proteins has become possible these methods have proven invaluable in furthering various avenues of viral research proteomic analysis of viruses has included identification of proteins in virus particles characterization of virushost proteinprotein interactions and analysis of serum proteins for biomarkers of diseaseone aspect of viral proteomics has been the characterization of virus particles and virally infected cells characterization of purified virions has led to the identification of viral proteins that were not originally identified with the virion as well as the identification of cellular proteins associated with the purified virus for example analysis of hcmv viral particles identified 12 additional orfs not previously known to reside in virions as well as the identification of 71 cellular proteins 6 the importance of these cellular and viral proteins in viral replication or pathogenesis awaits further analysis additionally 12 unique polypeptides were identified that did not correspond to previously identified orfs 6 illustrating the fact that despite intensive sequence analysis sequence characteristics of viral promoters and orfs are still not entirely understood analysis of virally infected cells has also led to the characterization of events leading to ebv-induced transformation 9 10 47 identification of cellular proteins induced in hiv-infected macrophages 31 and identification of cellular proteins that may be involved in aids-associated dementia 66the characterization of virushost proteinprotein interactions has been intensely studied originally most studies have relied on the analysis of the interaction of two proteins or used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify new protein partners of a protein of interest these studies however are quite labor intensive furthermore the yeast two-hybrid system is susceptible to false-positive identifications cannot be used to identify multiprotein complexes and typically does not take into account possible ptm that may influence protein binding proteomic analysis however can be used to identify multiprotein complexes and when used in the analysis of infected cells will take into account any ptm that occur in infected cells proteomic analysis of infected cells has resulted in the identification of cellular proteins that may mediate hsv ic27-induced repression of cellular protein synthesis 18 and the identification of over 50 cellular and viral proteins in hsv dna replication 19 furthermore analysis of the hiv tat and htlv tax proteomes identified members of chromatin remodeling complexes as components of these viral transactivator multiprotein complexes 6073 many of these studies will allow for further understanding of virus transcription replication and transformation additionally these studies may lead to the identification of unique drug targets for example the p-tefb complex has been shown to be critical for hiv gene expression 56 60 116 and hiv-infected cells are uniquely sensitive to the transcription suppressing effects of the p-tefb inhibitor flavopiridol 116 117 118a number of viruses are the causative agents of cancer including ebv hepatitis b virus and hepatitis c virus hcv hcv is a major cause of the increasing incidence of liver cancer in developed countries 80 though events leading to transformation are not well understood until recently 8687 an infectious cell culture model of hcv has not been available the lack of a cell culture model has prevented the systematic analysis of changes induced by hcv infection alternative approaches to studying hcv transformation have been the comparison of liver tissue and hepatoma-derived cell lines 82 83 84 and analysis of a single virus ns5ahost hsp27 proteinprotein interaction 26 further analysis of additional hcv proteins and infected cells will provide additional insights into the nature of this virus and its ability to cause cancerone aspect of viral proteomics that is of interest to physicians is the analysis of serum for protein biomarkers of disease studies have been performed on patients infected with sars-cov hiv hcv hbv and hiv-1 using a variety of approaches some of the methods that have been used are 2d-page followed by ms lcmsms seldi proteinchips and protein microarrays these methods have their advantages and disadvantages 2d gel electrophoresis allows for resolution of greater than 1000 protein species can be used for quantitative analysis of expression and reflects changes in ptm and the identification of isoforms however several issues with 2d gel electrophoresis are its lack of reproducibility the difficulty in detecting hydrophobic proteins low sensitivity and the inability to use a high-throughput method to analyze a large number of samples lcms has the advantages of solubilization of the majority of proteins automation ability to switch columns and sensitivity however the ability to quantify changes in protein levels is lost with lcmsthe seldi proteinchip is unique in that it allows for differential separation of complex protein mixtures based on chemical characteristics such as hydrophobicity or charge resulting in a decrease in the complexity of the sample analyzed however seldi is considered a soft-ionization method and the results obtained are patterns of protein peaks and not the identification of peptide masses to ensure the specificity of peak profile for a particular disease state a robust algorithm is needed lastly protein microarrays have been developed to determine the immune response to a viral infection the method requires the expression and printing of all orfs of a pathogen and cross-linking them to a solid support protein microarrays would allow for the rapid diagnosis of a particular viral infection however expression of a complete proteome is a challenging task as the proteins are expressed in bacteria potentially important ptm are lost and proteins may not be properly foldedserum is a complex mixture of proteins that is dominated by two proteinsalbumin and immunoglobulin ig 119 the abundance of these proteins means that analysis of serum for potential biomarkers of disease requires either very sensitive methods or separation of albumin and ig from serum several albumin andor ig depletion methods have been developed to resolve this issue pieper et al 120 developed a series of chromatographic columns to separate immunoglobulins based on their affinity for proteins a and g as well as columns containing antibodies with specificities for individual proteins such as albumin fibrinogen and transferrin the columns were successful in depleting serum samples of their respective proteins and use of several columns significantly decreased the complexity of the sample analyzed 120 additionally a mixed-bed column was developed that allowed the simultaneous separation of several proteins which would allow for automated processing of samples a similar approach has been developed by bio-rad affi-gel blue to deplete samples of albumin enhancing the detection of other proteins in the sample 121 affi-gel blue has affinity for hydrophobic aromatic or sterically active binding sites of protein although this product has high affinity for albumin it may bind other proteins as well limiting its usefulness lastly baussant et al 122 developed a peptide-based approach to deplete albumin their approach was based on the fact that although protein g has affinity for the fc region of igg it can also bind albumin less specifically baussant et al modified a peptide of protein g to have a much higher affinity for albumin which significantly and specifically depleted the serum of albumin however other hydrophobic proteins ie apolipoproteins were also captured 122despite their relatively small size viruses are fairly complex and encode between a dozen and more than 200 proteins many of these proteins are posttranslationally modified and interact with other viral and host proteins to function identifying the proteins that are encoded by viruses and the proteins with which they interact will greatly further the understanding of viral replication and pathogenesis and proteomic approaches will greatly facilitate these studies lastly the ability to diagnose cancer or viral infections at early stages will allow for early treatment and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases proteomic analysis of biological markers in serum should allow for the early noninvasive diagnosis of cancer although good reliable methods are available for the analysis of the serum proteome the abundance of a few proteins ie albumin and ig and the low abundance of many other proteins will require methods for separating out the high-abundance proteins and instruments and methods with enough sensitivity to identify proteins at low concentrationit is becoming increasingly clear that the field of proteomics may require better and more robust separation methods sensitive instrumentation and unbiased bioinformatic tools 2de has historically provided a rapid means for separating thousands of proteins from cell and tissue samples in one run although this is a powerful research tool and has been enthusiastically applied in many fields of biomedical research accurate analysis and interpretation of the data have provided many challenges several analysis steps are needed to convert the large amount of noisy data obtained with 2de into reliable and interpretable biological information the goals of such analysis steps include accurate protein detection and quantification consistent comparative visualization methods as well as the identification of differentially expressed proteins between samples run on different gels to achieve these goals systematic errors such as geometric distortions between the gels must be corrected by using computer-assisted methods a wide range of computer software has been developed but no general consensus exists as a standard for 2de data analysis protocolsin search for new diagnostic and therapeutic targets 2de has been used to study differential expression of peptides and proteins in various disease entities however 2de usually requires large amounts of starting material is time-consuming and reveals only a fraction of the proteins present in a given sample more recently the proteinchip technology coupled with bioinformatics has gained considerable attention this technique uses seldi-tofms to screen protein sources for putative disease biomarkers in a spectrum from 2 to 20 kda several studies have provided evidence that proteinchip technology is capable of detecting early-stage cancer by its unique cancer-specific proteomic fingerprints with sensitivities and specificities reaching far beyond well-established serum-based tumor markers 123 however as in most rapid diagnosis tests seldi technology can still not detect the nature of the amino acid biomarkers or their ptm in a consistent and reproducible manner clearly other technologies such as the lcmsms and the lc-fticr are far more sensitive and better in defining the composition of these biomarkersfinally very recently much effort has gone into the concept of lab-on-a-chip these chips involve micron-sized channels embedded in glass or silicon chips attempts have been made to carry out two-dimensional gel-based experiments on chips microchips that are able to carry out microfluidic experiments are being developed eg nanogen inc diagnoswiss caliper technologies which are faster and more accurate than the conventional gel technology if such technologies were made 2de compatible then it would offer immense research potential especially promising are advancements in detecting low-abundance proteins and ptmin this chapter we have discussed the latest new proteomics findings that relate to some of the most important viral infections known to humans these included hcmv hsv ebv kshv hiv htlv hbv hcv and sars infections in many instances we have seen a mere description of the viral or the infected host cell proteome however most of the data to date are descriptive in nature and very few studies have correlated phenotype of the infection to the pathology or drug treatment although in some cases investigators have found new enzyme targets as markers ie sars-cov no serious attempts have been made to functionally identify their significance in the pathology of the virus this is mainly because the field of viral proteomics is at its early stages of development and much confirmatory information would be required from animal or human model studies which are currently either in progress or will need to be developed in near future therefore a new field of functional viral proteomics is developing in both industrial and academic settings to address issues related to functional biomarkers drug-resistance viruses and hostpathogen relations that pertain to disease prognosis treatment decision and monitoring response to therapyanother challenging consideration is the mixed infections seen in aids patients who not only may have varying hiv-1 clade infections more than seven clades and close to 1500 genetically distinct hiv-1 genotypes but also are coinfected with other viruses such as hcv or kshv the complication of identifying biomarkers in these patients or in some instances animal models has never been properly addressed in the current literature nor is there enough awareness between various compartments of patient bench to bedside practices therefore a better flow of information using solid epidemiological data followed by better diagnostics for the viral etiology would allow a meaningful identification of the proteome biomarkers seen in these patients these multiple biomarkers would serve as invaluable tools for multiple drug treatments and better control of mixed infections
finally the issue of frontend purification for the collected test material is perhaps the most important aspect of sample preparation currently there are various methods that utilize standard separation techniques to remove most abundant proteins prior to ms ie removal of some 20 high-abundance proteins and better visualization of low-abundance proteins sigma-aldrich kits however in most cases the removal of these proteins may in fact compromise the detection of biomarkers or their partners since in many instances viral infection leads to overexpression of the most abundant proteins such as the actins keratins tubulins cyclophilins vimentin and hsps among others therefore future attempts at the identification of biomarkers would have to define not only the most high- and low-abundance proteins but also their partners and possible modificationsthis work was supported in part by grants from the george washington university ref funds to drs fatah kashanchi and akos vertes and nih grants ai44357 ai43894 and 13969 to dr fatah kashanchi we would like to thank cynthia de la fuente and kylene kehn for their contributions and review of the literature and lynne mied for the development of figuresthe inflammatory chemokine interferon-gamma inducible protein of 10 kda ip-10 also known as c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 10 cxcl10 is a biomarker associated with obesity

angiogenesis inhibition cell chemotaxis regulation of cell growth and proliferation and apoptosis 11 12 13 14 15 infections associated with ip-10 include those caused by parasites viruses bacteria and fungi 3 ip-10 production is associated with both protection from and facilitation of infection recent reports have indicated increased levels of ip-10 occur with acute respiratory infections aris and suggest a biomarker role for ip-10 16 17 18 19the present study investigated serum concentrations of ip-10 in otherwise healthy patients who developed aris in order to further ascertain a link between ari and ip-10 concentrations the development of a biomarker for virally-mediated aris could potentially lead to a methodology to point to infection etiology and severity in order to formulate a treatment plan based on previous studies the hypothesis is that serum ip-10 concentrations correlate with ari severity and durations in otherwise healthy individuals also we considered that the detection of virus in nasal specimens would be associated with ip-10 concentration obtained early in the ari course this could potentially be helpful as there are few if any clinically useful markers of mild to moderate severity acute respiratory infectiondata come from a randomized controlled trial measuring the effects of mindfulness meditation or exercise on the incidence and severity of ari clinical trials id nct01654289 study participants were community-recruited adults ages 3069 who were generally healthy and who reported getting at least one cold per year three cohorts of 99 105 and 104 healthy individuals who gave written informed consent over three seasons were enrolled in august and september and were followed until may the trial is ongoing and the investigators are still blinded ip-10 concentrations used in this analysis were measured at study entry before randomization of intervention occurred and within the first 72 h following onset of ari it is still unknown if or how the meditation or exercise interventions could influence ip-10 measurements the study protocol was approved by the university of wisconsin-madison institutional review board for human subjects researcheach participant had blood drawn at study entry when a participant reported ari symptoms equaling 2 or greater on the jackson scale samples were collected within the first 72 h of onset of symptoms blood samples were collected using standard venipuncture techniques and the serum was frozen at 80 c ip-10 concentrations were measured in picograms per milliliter pgml using elisa according to manufacturers protocol r and d systems minneapolis mn the assay range is 78500 pgml and samples with concentrations greater than the highest standard were diluted as directed by the manufacturers protocol and remeasured at the time that the participant contacted the study coordinators to report an ari the participant performed a nasal self-swab a nasal lavage was done at the time of the blood draw multiplex pcr was used to detect and identify respiratory viruses in nasal swab and wash samples over 100 rhinovirus serotypes as well as serotypes of influenza parainfluenza coronavirus respiratory syncytial virus adenovirus enterovirus and metapneumovirus can be identified overall sensitivity is estimated at 94 with 99 specificity 20 viruses detected in either nasal swab or lavage were considered positive viruses were grouped by type for analysis adenovirus and bocavirus coronaviruses enterovirus and rhinovirus influenza viruses paramyxoviruses metapneumovirus parainfluenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virusesafter providing written informed consent participants were contacted every week using a web-based surveillance system to prompt self-reported ari episodes the jackson criteria were used to define the beginning of an ari episode three criteria had to be met 1 answer yes to either do you think you have a cold or do you think you are coming down with a cold 2 report at least one of four cold symptoms nasal discharge nasal obstruction sneezing or sore throat and 3 score at least two points on the jackson scale the jackson score is calculated by summing scores for eight symptoms sneezing headache malaise chilliness nasal discharge nasal obstruction sore throat and cough each symptom is rated 0 1 2 or 3 from absent to severe 21 data about symptom severity and quality of life impact were collected daily using the validated wisconsin upper respiratory symptom survey wurss-24 until the ari episode resolved 22 23 the daily severity score is calculated by adding the wurss items for that day to calculate area under the curve wurss auc for ari global severity the sum of wurss totals across all daily time points of the illness episode was used and trapezoidal approximation was then applied 24 25 wurss can be divided into three categories of symptoms nasal throat and quality of life qol symptoms 25 26to assess the relationship between the ari illness outcomes and ip-10 spearman correlations were computed fishers z transformation was used to compute 95 confident intervals ci around the correlations wilcoxon scores were computed and used in the kruskalwallis test to compare continuous variables by groupings eg ari global severity between participants with corresponding ip-10 measurements versus those without ip-10 measurements at time of ari generalized linear regression modeling techniques were used to assess the relationship between ari outcomes and ip-10 after adjusting for baseline covariates age sex and body mass index bmi repeated measures modeling was used to account for the correlation between observations within a participant for those who had more than one ari generalized linear regression modeling techniques with repeated measures correlations were also used to compute lsmeans comparisons between the viral infection categories using the tukey adjustment for multiple comparisons ari global severity ari duration and ip-10 are highly skewed measurements we transformed these measurements on the log base10 scale before running the regression models observed measurements for these data are presented as medians and interquartile ranges iqr for the change from baseline models with log base 10 transformed outcome variables change was calculated as log10ari at later time pointari at baseline the beta can be interpreted as a percentage change in the outcome eg ari global severity for every unit increase in the predictor variable eg ip-10 all statistical analyses were run using sas 93of the 308 individuals enrolled in the study 181 participants experienced 284 ari episodes we were unable to measure ip-10 levels during 59 of the ari episodes due to challenges getting samples within 72 h of onset of symptoms as required by protocol fig 1
 thus we were able to collect serum samples for ip-10 concentration during 225 ari episodes that occurred in 157 individuals table 1
 characteristics of these 225 ari episodes with corresponding ip-10 collection can be also be found in table 1 there were no statistically significant differences in ari global severity or ari duration between the ari episodes where ip-10 was collected as compared to the ari episodes where ip-10 was not collected in addition we were unable to collect ip-10 on the same day as the wurss symptom scores for five aris n

  0008this paper presents some evidence that ip-10 concentration early during the ari may serve as a useful predictor of ari outcome including severity and duration in healthy adults the concentration of ip-10 appears to correlate with symptom severity and hence could serve as a useful marker or predictor of ari illness severity ip-10 correlates with symptoms on the day that it is measured and appears to predict subsequent severity and duration it appears to correlate with all three groups of symptoms used to measure ari severity as expected from a potential biomarker in serum 25 26in the context of a clinical study such as the one reported here participants also have baseline ip-10 concentrations measured at study entry a time when they are not sick we show that the change in ip-10 concentration at ari over baseline also correlates with ari severity and duration this finding confirms that the ip-10 concentrations increase with ari illness for example ip-10 could potentially be helpful with risk-stratification with refining the differential diagnosis or even possibly with clinical decision-making such as whether to initiate antiviral treatment future work would be needed to formally test these possibilitiesserum ip-10 correlates with detection of virus in nasal specimens obtained within the first 72 h of symptoms parallel correlations exist in that influenza and paramyxovirus infections are associated with higher ip-10 concentrations and greater ari severity as measured by wurss auc compared to infections caused by coronaviruses enteroviruses and rhinoviruses our results are consistent with the findings from another laboratory that found higher ip-10 concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage samples in which a virus was identified 17 however the patients in that study were much sicker as all were hospitalized and underwent bronchoscopy for diagnosis of their lower respiratory tract infectionfew serum biomarkers of ari have been identified in fact for all-cause community-acquired ari illness no reliable predictor of severity or duration exists 27 our group previously found a positive correlation between interleukin-8 concentrations in nasal wash and severity and duration of ari nasal symptoms including runny nose plugged nose and sneezing 25 in contrast serum procalcitonin is not a useful marker for ari 28 other research groups have reported that nasal ip-10 is correlated with ari primarily among people with underlying illness 29 30 31 aris caused by parainfluenza virus in adults with severe multiple disabilities had an almost 9 fold increase in the serum concentration of ip-10 during the acute phase of the infection 16 additionally in other populations with underlying illnesses such as asthma or copd ip-10 concentrations measured in serum 16 32 33 34 or nasal 31 samples or ip-10 gene expression 19 35 again correlated with acute respiratory infections leading to exacerbations although ip-10 concentrations are higher in smokers with copd but not in smokers generally 36 the number of smokers in our cohort is small and hence unlikely to influence ip-10 concentrations however we also analyzed change in ip-10 with ari and got the same results although the correlations are relatively modest our study results show that serum ip-10 is a potentially useful marker for ari severity and trends with ari duration in this healthy populationalthough ip-10 is elevated with influenza infections compared to controls ip-10 has not been shown to be useful for identifying severe influenza infections 37 although large increases in ip-10 concentrations were observed with parainfluenza infections no correlations with clinical severity of infection were apparent 16 in contrast we found that ip-10 concentrations correlate with ari symptoms on the day measured early in the course of the infection as well as with severity and duration of ari in a cohort of healthy individualsthe ari episodes in these healthy individuals were mild to moderate in severity these were community-recruited female-predominated participants who are primarily white well-educated and agreed to be monitored for a cold-and-flu season the vast majority of illness episodes were not severe enough to prompt clinical evaluation a sample collected from people presenting to clinic would likely demonstrate somewhat higher severity and biomarker values which might influence the relationships reported here 38 39 the nasal specimens in which no virus was detected are certainly not always without viral or infectious cause there are several reasons why we did not identify virus in someone sick with what appears to be an ari 1 we did not test for the virus causing the infection 2 the symptoms are associated with an allergic response or other inflammatory reaction 3 the infection is of bacterial 40 or fungal etiology 4 the symptoms are caused by chemical irritation 5 the symptoms are psychosomaticour study results provide evidence that ip-10 is a biomarker for ari severity in healthy adults serum ip-10 concentration correlates with ari severity as measured by wurss on the day that it is measured also ip-10 concentration measured early in the course of the ari correlates with both the severity and trends with duration of the illnessnone declaredthe study protocol was approved by the university of wisconsin-madison institutional review board for human subjects researchacute respiratory infection illness also known as the common cold upper respiratory tract infection or upper respiratory infection is an acute infection generally viral in etiology involving structures of the upper airways simoes et al 2006 the most common causative agent is rhinovirus but several other respiratory viruses are also known to cause acute respiratory illness gwaltney 1985 acute respiratory infection is a common occurrence yet detrimental to wellbeing moreover there is currently no cure or effective treatment option available cohen et al 1993 carter 2002 symptoms of acute respiratory infection illness can be examined threedimensionally in the following groups nasal throat and quality of life obasi et al 2013 these unpleasant and sometimes severe symptoms cause people to miss work and to utilize healthcare services which places a notable burden on the individual and society fendrick et al 2003 eccles 2005 fiore et al 2010 ebell and afonso 2011for many years it has been known that some inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin8 il8 play a role in the pathophysiology of the common cold as levels are found to increase in individuals sick with viral rhinitis compared to healthy individuals choi and jacoby 1992 becker et al 1993 noah et al 1995 rseler et al 1995 gern et al 1996 johnston et al 1997 zhu et al 1997 kaul et al 2000 parry et al 2000 within the immune system il8 acts to recruit and activate neutrophils contributing to inflammation naclerio et al 1988 teran et al 1997 zeilhofer and schorr 2000 turner 2001 however little work has been done to correlate il8 concentrations with specific acute respiratory infection symptoms and degree of illness this paper presents important novel research boasting over 800 common cold cases with biomarkers and detailed records of acute respiratory infection severity making the breadth of our study unique additionally not only is the relationship of the biomarkers with overall illness severity examined but also more than 20 separate symptoms are considered one by one and in meaningful clusters in order to hone in on exactly what the relationship is between inflammatory biomarkers and certain cold symptoms by investigating the relationship between acute respiratory infection illness severity and inflammatory biomarkers the intent was to determine whether certain symptoms correlate more closely than others with inflammatory biomarkers such as il8 and nasal neutrophils an additional aim was to gain insight into the predictability of overall severity and duration of acute respiratory infection episodes based on change in il8 and neutrophil levels during the first 3 days of illnessin order to answer these questions data sets from two studies barrett et al 2010 barrett et al 2012 were combined to look at a total of 811 acute respiratory infection episodes in both studies a nasal lavage was performed within the first 72 hr of the onset of symptoms in one of the studies 685 participants returned about 48 hr later to provide a second nasal specimen during their acute respiratory infection the nasal specimens were used to measure il8 concentrations and neutrophil counts and to undergo multiplex polymerase chain reaction pcr for the detection and identification of respiratory viruses throughout the duration of the acute respiratory infection episode participants provided information about their symptoms on a selfreport basis using the wellvalidated wisconsin upper respiratory symptom survey wurss21 barrett et al 2002 barrett et al 2005 barrett et al 2009 the wurss scores were then used to statistically analyze correlations of symptom severity with il8 and neutrophil levelsil8 and nasal neutrophils were hypothesized to have a significant positive correlation with overall acute respiratory infection severity measured by both area under the curve auc and wurss total upon examination of the 21 wurss items the nasal group symptoms runny nose plugged nose and sneezing obasi et al 2013 were hypothesized to have the most significant correlations with the inflammatory biomarkers examined finally it was hypothesized that higher il8 and nasal neutrophil levels on day 1 of the acute respiratory infection would be associated with lower wurss total on day 3 of the acute respiratory infection due to the initial vigorous immune response leading to quicker amelioration of symptomsin the pep trial physician echinacea and placebo which is a shortened version of the trial title placebo physician or pill a randomized controlled trial in a common cold model barrett et al 2007 barrett et al 2010 barrett et al 2011 n  718 participants gave written informed consent then were enrolled within the first 36 hr of newonset common cold symptoms and were followed until their colds resolved the population consisted of communityrecruited 12 to 80 year olds enrollment and monitoring occurred over a period of about four and a half years from january 2004 until august 2008 daily contact was made by telephone for the duration of participationin the mepari trial meditation or exercise for preventing acute respiratory infection a randomized controlled trial barrett et al 2012 written informed consent was obtained from n  154 healthy individuals aged 50 years and older who were recruited from the community the first cohort n  94 was enrolled in september 2009 while the second cohort n  60 began in january 2010 participants from both cohorts were followed until exiting in may 2010 during the entire trial participants were asked to start documenting symptoms anytime they thought they were getting a cold participants were contacted two times a week by telephone throughout the duration of the studyboth trials used the same criteria to define an acute respiratory infection illness episode 1 answer yes to either do you think you are coming down with a cold or do you think you have a cold 2 exhibit one or more of four cold symptoms  nasal discharge nasal obstruction sneezing sore throat and 3 score two points or more on the jackson scale jackson et al 1962 the jackson score is calculated by summing eight symptom scores sneezing headache malaise chilliness nasal discharge nasal obstruction sore throat and cough where each is rated 0  absent 1  mild 2  moderate 3  severe in the pep trial illness episode duration began at enrollment and continued through the last time the participant answered yes to do you think you still have a cold to confirm that the illness had ended the last yes answer had to be followed by a no answer for two days in a row monitoring was limited to a maximum of 14 days in the mepari trial the beginning of each acute respiratory infection illness episode was determined by the defining criteria described above the last day of the illness episode was the last day the participant rated illness severity higher than 0 in response to how sick do you feel today on the wurss instrument in both trials the date and time of selfreport questionnaires were recorded in order to assess illness durationacute respiratory infection severity was assessed using the wisconsin upper respiratory symptom survey wurss barrett et al 2002 barrett et al 2005 which is a well validated illness specific quality of life outcome instrument items assess symptom severity and functional impairment with a score of 1 considered to be very mild 3 mild 5 moderate and 7 severe throughout the length of the illness the wurss21 barrett et al 2009 was selfadministered twice daily by each pep participant and the wurss24 daily by mepari participants the wurss21 contains one item rating overall illness severity how sick do you feel today 10 items rating cold symptoms runny nose plugged nose sneezing sore throat scratchy throat cough hoarseness head congestion chest congestion feeling tired nine items rating how much the cold episode has interfered with function and quality of life think clearly sleep well breathe easily walk climb stairs exercise accomplish daily activities work outside the home work inside the home interact with others live your personal life and one item rating daily change compared to yesterday i feel that my cold is wurss24 is a derivation of the wurss44 and includes all wurss21 items plus three items rating influenzalike symptoms these three items were not included in this study in order to make the wurss scores between the two trials parallelillness duration was assessed in hours and minutes according to the times of selfreport and then converted to decimalized days for the pep trial morning and evening scores for each item of the wurss21 were first averaged in both trials for each day of illness wurss total was calculated by summing 19 items on the wurss21 not including the first item assessing overall illness severity or the last item assessing change since the previous day to calculate area under the curve auc for global severity the sum of wurss totals across all time points of the illness episode was used and trapezoidal approximation was applied nasal auc was calculated by using the sum of the wurss scores from only the nasal symptoms runny nose plugged nose sneezing for the duration of the acute respiratory infection episode individual symptoms from the wurss were analyzed with respect to the main variables using the wurss score from day 1 of the acute respiratory infection episode which corresponds to the day the nasal specimens were collected for biomarker analysessamples were collected at enrollment day 1 and again on day 3 of participation in the pep trial in the mepari trial when a participant reported acute respiratory infection symptoms equaling two or greater on the jackson scale samples were collected within the first 72 hr of onset of symptoms nasal specimens were obtained by performing nasal lavage and were used for analysis of il8 and neutrophils as indicators of nasal inflammation nasal lavage specimens were also used for pcrbased viral identification in both trials il8 concentrations were measured in picograms per milliliter pgml using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay test elisa according to manufacturers protocol polymorphonuclear leukocytes were counted using a standard hemocytometer in both trials and expressed as neutrophils per milliliter pmnml multiplex pcr methods developed and validated at uwmadison were used to detect and identify respiratory viruses in nasal wash samples with this accurate highthroughput assay over 100 rhinovirus serotypes as well as serotypes of influenza parainfluenza coronavirus respiratory syncytial virus adenovirus enterovirus and metapneumovirus can be identified overall sensitivity is estimated at 94 with 99 specificity lee et al 2007to assess the correlation among the variables il8 neutrophils auc and acute respiratory infection duration spearman tests were done using spss version 20 linear regression assessed the relationship between biomarkers and symptoms pearson correlation coefficients between biomarkers and certain symptoms were reported and students t tests were used to test the significance of any specific symptom in the corresponding linear model table iii these tests were done using r version 302 the r foundation for statistical computing httpr-projectorg preliminary analysis showed that the ranges of some variables were very wide and skewed for example the il8 and neutrophil values which ranged from zero to more than ten thousand in this case the boxcox transformation box and cox 1964 was used to transform these values in order to make the data more normally distributed thus improving the validity of measures of association such as the pearson correlation between variables and for other data stabilization proceduresfor the results regarding each model the summary statistics are listed including the estimated values for covariates standard errors tstatistics and corresponding pvalues the pearson correlation coefficients between certain important variables are also reported to better explain the relationships of symptoms and biomarkersa total of 811 acute respiratory infection episodes were analyzed making up 7124 days of acute respiratory infection illness with a mean global severity score auc of 275 of these 56 tested positive for pcr identifiable respiratory viruses including adenovirus bocavirus coronavirus enterovirus influenza virus metapneumovirus parainfluenzavirus rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus the biomarkers examined showed the mean il8 was 1139 pgml and mean neutrophils were 68 pmnml table ioriginally called neutrophil activating factor1 naf1 il8 is a chemokine that recruits and activates neutrophils marsh and kendall 1996 zeilhofer and schorr 2000 as physiologically expected il8 correlated significantly with neutrophils in the positive direction r  058 p  0001 teran et al 1997 turner et al 1998 participants who had higher levels of il8 had consistently more nasal neutrophils fig 1significant positive correlation of both il8 and neutrophils with auc and acute respiratory infection duration was found participants who had a higher concentration of il8 had colds that lasted longer and were more severe similarly participants who had more nasal neutrophils had longer lasting and more severe colds table ii the correlation between il8 and global severity of nasal specific symptoms or nasal auc for the entire illness episode showed a positive trend r  00031 p  0066 neutrophils also trended positively with nasal auc r  00035 p  0088 on day 1 il8 significantly correlated with each of the three symptoms from the nasal group of wurss rhinorrhea nasal obstruction and sternutation sneezing interestingly il8 on day 1 of the illness also correlated with scratchy throat and with how participants responded to a question gauging overall symptom improvement nasal neutrophils correlated strongly with global severity measured by wurss total although the correlation was not maintained when nasal symptoms were considered individually with the exception of runny nose in addition to correlating with runny nose and global severity neutrophils also correlated with scratchy throat thinking clearly and sleeping well table iiiin order to investigate whether the il8 and neutrophil levels from day 1 of an acute respiratory infection episode can predict characteristics of the illness a couple days later a time points analysis was performed using biomarkers on day 1 and wurss total on day 3 of the pep trial it was hypothesized that high levels of il8 and neutrophils on day 1 would predict low wurss score on day 3 however the findings were insignificantthe results of this study show there is a significant correlation between nasal il8 and neutrophils with the severity of rhinorrhea nasal obstruction and sternutation during acute respiratory infection illness these data support the hypothesis that il8 and neutrophils play a significant role in respiratory infectionrelated nasal symptoms looking at the interconnectedness between biomarkers il8 a proinflammatory cytokine was found to significantly correlate with neutrophils in the positive direction which makes sense physiologically as il8 is a chemoattractant for neutrophils teran et al 1997 several cytokine genes and gene products including those for il8 are known to play significant roles in the induction and modulation of inflammation in human nasal epithelium becker et al 1993 a clear correlation of the biomarkers il8 and nasal neutrophils with symptoms of the common cold is shown using this sizeable and diverse set of datamany in vitro studies have found a relationship between viral respiratory infection and il8 expression andor concentrations one study found a 4 to 10fold increase in il8 mrna expression after infecting human nasal epithelium with respiratory syncytial virus rsv or stimulation with tumor necrosis factor or interleukin1 becker et al 1993 they determined that il8 is a major cytokine of human nasal epithelium constitutively expressed and readily produced upon virus infection rsv has also been found to increase both il8 gene expression in human lung epithelial a549 cells fiedler et al 1995 and il8 release by buffy coat cells especially in the presence of lung surfactant protein a hickling et al 2000 another study showed that adenovirusinduced rafmapk activation contributes to il8 production bruder and kovesdi 1997 additionally influenza virus a has been determined to induce interleukin8 expression in human airway epithelial cells choi and jacoby 1992cytokine levels have also been examined in naturally acquired viral rhinitis one group of investigators found elevated il8 levels in patients with viral rhinitis when compared to control subjects which suggests that il8 among other cytokines play a role in the pathophysiology of the common cold rseler et al 1995 the current findings support and extend the known role of il8 in acute respiratory infection in addition to showing il8 concentrations are high in individuals with acute respiratory infection the current results show that the il8 concentration correlates with symptom severity while the previous study examined specimens from 20 patients with naturally acquired viral rhinitis this studys sample size is much larger with nasal specimens for over 800 communityacquired acute respiratory infectionsthe elevation of certain biomarkers such as il8 during acute respiratory infection has been most studied in rhinovirus infection several authors have reported a direct correlation between the severity of symptoms associated with in vitro rhinovirus infection and the concentration of interleukin8 in nasal secretions biagioli et al examined the mechanism of rhinovirusinduced il8 response and suggested that mediation occurs through production of oxidative species and the subsequent activation of nfkappab biagioli et al 1999 that study was carried out in vitro the current study supports that studys findings and is more clinically applicable as infections were naturally communityacquired and are correlated with symptom severity global severity measured by auc was found to correlate with biomarker concentrations of il8 and neutrophils gern and colleagues report il8 production contributes to acute respiratory infection symptom severity in children with rhinovirus or influenza a infection gern et al 2002 while this study used a different symptom scale it too found that il8 correlated with acute respiratory infection severity when all the acute respiratory infection episodes reported in the studied adult population are considered among these 811 episodes nine types of viruses were identified an analysis by viral type was tried but once divided by virus the number of acute respiratory infection episodes in each group had insufficient power to draw conclusionsa general correlation has been shown between il8 and overall acute respiratory infection severity the recent goal however was to hone in on the specific symptoms or groups of symptoms that correlate most closely with il8 and neutrophils the results highlight rhinitis related symptoms and these findings are supported by the literature one study examined the association between experimental rhinovirus infection and the elaboration of il8 into nasal secretions and also looked at rhinovirusassociated common cold symptoms turner et al 1998 they found il8 concentrations were significantly higher in infected symptomatic subjects compared to infected asymptomatic or placeboinfected subjects more specifically there was a correlation between severity of nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea with the change in il8 concentration from baseline to 24 days after virus challengein addition to correlating with nasal symptoms il8 correlated with scratchy throat and with the item gauging overall symptom improvement neutrophils correlated with scratchy throat and two quality of life symptoms thinking clearly and sleeping well the scratchy throat correlation with il8 and neutrophils could be explained as a result of postnasal drip triggered by acute respiratory infection the correlation between neutrophils and sleep quality is an interesting issue healthy individuals who are sleep deprived are known to have increased neutrophils boudjeltia et al 2008 ruiz et al 2012 similarly night shift workers have been found to have increased levels of inflammatory markers including neutrophils compared to individuals who work day shift alireza et al 2011 additionally individuals with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome osas have a higher percentage of sputum neutrophils compared to normal controls lacedonia et al 2011 all of these examples imply that the poor sleep leads to the neutrophil increase however during an acute respiratory infection the neutrophils are likely due to the infection which leads to poor sleep quality nasal symptoms due to neutrophil infiltrated nonallergic rhinitis have been shown to have a large effect on sleep quality and quality of life gelardi et al 2008 even though the participants we studied exhibit a different disease state than sleep apnea it shows an important and consistent relationship between nasal symptoms and sleep quality likely the poor sleep quality is due to nasal neutrophils but our study does not allow us to determine if the poor sleep quality is a result of the nasal neutrophils or if the nasal neutrophils are a result of the poor sleep qualitypreviously no biomarkers have correlated well with acute respiratory infection illness domains or specific symptoms nor have they been shown to predict outcomes barrett et al 2006 barrett et al 2009 the current studys results show a strong correlation with the nasal domain of acute respiratory infection illness namely nonallergic rhinitis and in fact most strongly with three specific symptoms rhinorrhea nasal obstruction and sternutation however a biomarker or panel of biomarkers that correlate well with biological symptoms and quality of life measures remains elusivean important remaining question concerns the role of cytokines and cells in the clearance of acute respiratory infection virus in humans compared to the mediation of symptoms il8 has been shown to be linked to clearance of a porcine respiratory virus lunney et al 2010 and one study suggests that neutrophils do not play an important role in viral clearance during influenza virus infection in mice wareing et al 2007 furthermore investigators have run human experiments that attempt to determine predictability of acute respiratory infection severity or duration one group of researchers asked clinicians and patients to predict the severity and duration of acute respiratory infection at an initial visit and had the patient complete the wurss longmier et al 2013 there was no significant association found between participant and clinician predictions of severity or duration with the actual severity and duration of acute respiratory infection in order to answer a similar question about predictability of cold severity timepoints analysis that looked at il8 and neutrophil levels on day 1 of the acute respiratory infection episode was performed in relationship to wurss score on day 3 of the acute respiratory infection episode the analysis gave insignificant results therefore while il8 is indicative of inflammation it may not be a mediator affecting the chronological course of colds further research is necessary to determine if the concentration or change in concentration of cytokines throughout an acute respiratory infection episode can predict the overall duration and severity of the illness for example specimens from additional time points could be assayed and a larger array of cytokines could be measured in order to create a better model of the importance of cells and cytokines for the mediation of symptoms and the control of viral replication this insight could be useful for prevention and treatment options focusing on shortening the length of a cold and abating symptomsin conclusion the following nasal symptoms rhinorrhea nasal obstruction and sternutation have been determined to correlate more closely with the biomarkers il8 and neutrophils than other symptoms on the wurss21 item assessment tool additionally both correlate with scratchy throat finally within the quality of life group neutrophils correlated with thinking clearly and sleeping well while il8 negatively correlated with how participants responded to a question gauging overall symptom improvement while it has been known for years that cytokines like il8 are involved in the disease process of acute respiratory infection illnesses and while it is not surprising that the symptoms that correlate most closely with il8 and neutrophils from nasal specimens are nasal symptoms this relationship has not been well documented in detail until now with these findings knowing more about acute respiratory infection symptomology and its relationship with inflammatory biomarkers opens doors to discovering more effective curative treatment methods and potential medications for the amelioration of unpleasant and burdensome symptomsliquid biopsy is a minimally invasive technology for the detection of molecular biomarkers in blood and other body fluids urine saliva ascites fluids pleural effusions etc the term was coined several decades ago when was discovered for the first time the presence of extracellular nucleic acids in humans 1 currently it comprises not only the detection of extracellularcell-free nucleic acids nas with diagnostic significance but also of circulating tumor cells ctcs and extracellular vesicles evs mainly exosomes exs although liquid biopsy cannot provide information related to tissue architecture and pathological microenvironment it is considered a revolutionary technique that is opening unexpected perspectives in the early diagnosis and in the therapy monitoring severe diseases ranging from cancer 2 metabolic syndrome 3 autoimmune disease 4 neurodegenerative disorders and atherothrombosis 5 to prenatal screening 6despite the high potential of liquid biopsy the isolation characterization and quantification of na ctc and ex biomarkers due to their specific intrinsic features and low concentrations in the complex biological matrix require complex procedures and the systematic application in real practice is still hindered by many hurdles such as unsatisfactory specificity and sensitivity lack of standardization methods and cost-effectiveness recently a series of technological advancements in liquid biopsy has been obtained from the rapid development of nanotechnology-based strategies that provide a remarkable control over nanoparticle design allowing to tailor their properties toward specific applications 7 a plethora of nanomaterials nanostructures and molecular probes have been proposed for the fabrication of devices able to provide readable signals for early diagnosis and dynamic monitoring of diseases taking advantage of their outstanding electrical magnetic optical mechanical or thermal characteristics at nanoscale dimensions 8 due to their unique physicochemical properties arising from their high surface area size shape unique optical properties and surface chemistry graphene-based materials g can realistically devise more advanced applications for liquid biopsy scope the current review dealt with the recent advancements of g platforms for effectively capturing identification and quantification of na ct and ex biomarkers we discussed the main design criteria that have been used to develop multifunctional g platforms bringing out the specific role of g in the selective capture and identification of heterogeneous biomarkers from the body fluids particular attention was reserved for the advances of liquid biopsy in cancer diagnosis and monitoring final remarks were devoted to challenges and the opportunity to adapt g technology for the diagnosis of emerging viral diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19the outcomes of graphene-based platforms in sensing applications are strictly correlated to the physicochemical properties of the starting material used for their fabrication 9 however a univocal classification of g broad family and their correlation with biosensing properties are challenging thus the different synthetic approaches have been adopted for g preparation the not homogeneous g nature complexes structures with several oxidation states varied lateral sizes different number of layers and different colloidal stability the presence of impurities often metal impurities the formation of nanocomposites by a combination of g with organic or inorganic compounds have been taken in consideration for graphene-based biosensing applications 10g has been obtained by bottom-up or top-down approaches differing for i the number and dimension of layers ii the amount of oxygen functional groups scattered over the carbon surfaces iii chemical features of compounds introduced during the post-synthetic decoration process etc 11121314commonly high-quality mono or multilayer g systems have been obtained by bottom-up approaches such as epitaxial growth eg or chemical vapor deposition cvd on metallic substrates these materials are endowed with ideal features ie large surface area and high homogeneity to be used as components of electronic devices however the high cost of these strategies together with the requirement to transfer g on more suitable substrates has limited the graphenes scale-up production 15top-down strategies such as chemical or physical exfoliation of graphite bulk are regarded as valuable synthetic options to develop g for diagnostic devices 1617 g commonly used in the biosensing field includes graphene oxide go reduced graphene g-red functionalized graphene f-g together with emerging derivatives such as graphene quantum dot gqd n-doped multiple graphene aerogel graphene field-effect transistor gfet etc the plethora of g is continuously supplied by new derivatives with unique properties which potentially enable an entirely new generation of technologies beyond the limits of conventional materials 181920go is obtained by chemical oxidation of graphite and successive exfoliation of graphite oxide via ultrasonication oxygen functionality groups on go surfaces are widely exploited in the chemical functionalization of go especially by esterificationamidation reactions at the carboxylic groups 212223 processability and water stability due to ionizable groups on go surfaces are the main advantages in the use of go whereas the structural defects on the sp2 network and the lacking electrical conductivity are the main limits for go applications as an electronic device 24g-red is obtained from go nanosheets by different techniques including the solvothermal process or chemical reduction with hydrazine 2526 a partial restoring of the sp2 network which results in an improved electrical conductivity and mechanical strength of g-red compared to go has been obtained by the reduction process nowadays g-red stable colloidal systems are obtained by using biocompatible reducing agents such as gallic acid starch vitamin c etc allowing to reduce the cost and the environmental impact 27gqds are fluorescent carbon nanosystems generally arising from g or go composed of less than ten graphene layers with a later dimension less than 10 nm gqds do not possess only the intrinsic properties of graphene but also new properties due to edge effects and significant quantum confinement 28 a wide variety of gqds is obtained by bottom-up or top-down approaches in the first case the adopted strategies are characterized by a good size control and by the possibility to tune the gqds properties on the basis of substrate nature however they suffer from some drawbacks ie the employment of toxic solvent high temperature and substrate concentrations top-down approaches give a large scale production of gqds due to the early synthetic steps and the use of cheap carbon starting materials 29gqds have shown lower toxicity and higher photostability compared to other semiconducting quantum dots and several applications ranging from catalyst to nanomedicine have been proposed in particular electrochemical optical and photoelectrochemical biosensors based on gqds characterized by a high sensing selectivity have been developed 30an emerging class of 3d carbon materials aerogel foam hydrogel etc have been recently proposed for water decontamination and as conversionstorage energy devices 31 template-assisted methods based on cvd strategy or graphenego layers assembling processes such as self-assembly of g-red sheets reduced via the solvothermal or hydrothermal method have provided 3d graphene-based materials characterized by the intrinsic properties of g together with new interesting physicochemical properties such as high porosity low density unique electrochemical performance 32 n-doping strategies have been widely adopted to tune the electrochemical properties of g derivatives n-doped g has shown high performance like photocatalytic systems for the reduction of co2 and the degradation of organic contaminants under visible light 33the replacement of the traditional semiconductors-based electronic devices with a single layer graphene-based material has been proposed and used for the fabrication of gfet proposed as sensors in physical chemical and biological application fields 34considering the temporal and spatial heterogeneity and its evolution the tumor needs to be monitored at distinct times of the disease for an efficient treatment therefore there is an urgent need to search for minimally invasive approaches in order to detect and monitor the disease progression throughout the treatment indeed surgical tissue biopsies are invasive procedures often difficult to perform on organs that lie deep within the body and their use is limited as they can give false-negative results due to sampling therefore it is necessary to identify ideal biomarkers that can be used for the early diagnosis detection of recurrence and monitoring of metastasis for cancer a liquid biopsy might be a promising approach because it deals with the communication in tumor microenvironment according to several research studies the liquid biopsy is defined as the capture and the analysis of tumor-related biomarkers in a fluid sample the biomarkers are represented by circulant tumor cells ctcs circulant tumor nucleic acids ctnas proteins andor tumor-derived extracellular vesicles evs which have been shed from tumor masses figure 1 into the bloodstream saliva urine cerebrospinal fluid csf among other peripheral fluids of patients the liquid biopsy provides a more comprehensive snapshot of intra-tumor clonal heterogeneity compared to single-site tissue biopsies and in addition can allow repeated blood sampling thereby providing an insight into the evolutionary dynamics of cancer for these reasons liquid biopsy should be extensively studied due to its minimal invasiveness and can be used for the early diagnosis and monitoring of metastasis in cancer patients 35 the main approaches to liquid biopsies have embraced the detection of ctcs 3637 the capture of exosomes exs that are secreted by tumor mass 38 and the analysis of ctdna or mirna in body fluid samples 39 since the first studies indeed due to the rapid turnover of cancer cells and the constant release of tumor-derived nucleic acids vesicles and viable ctcs into the circulation the ability to detect and characterize has enabled surgeons to analyze the evolution of the tumor at distinct times and most importantly in a non-invasive manner literature data have demonstrated that levels of these biomarkers increase in patients with several malignant types of tumors such as breast ovarian cancer stomach colorectal prostate lung and others however most studies have been done in patients with late-stage cancer mainly due to the considerably higher concentrations of the above-mentioned biomarkers in their blood based on these promising findings data from wroclawski and collaborators demonstrated that serum dna levels were significantly increased in patients with colorectal cancer of stage iv and fluctuated during chemotherapy 40 lung cancer patients if compared to the control patients have demonstrated significant differences in ctdna levels since stage i 41 the fluctuations of ctdna were proposed by diehl et al as a biomarker to monitor the course of therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer mcrc undergoing surgery or chemotherapy treatments 42 the level of ctdna has been quantified by beaming beads emulsions amplification and magnetics and compared to carcinoembryonic antigen marker cea routinely used in the management of the disease in subjects with crc 42 numerous gastrointestinal diseases can also lead to an increase in ctdna even if considered malignant or benignthe diagnosis of ovarian cancer oc is mainly based on levels of biomarker ca-125 in blood and imaging recent data have shown that evs possess advantages in terms of abundance stability and accessibility compared with ctcs and ctdna furthermore the contents of evs are tumor-specific and reveal a high correlation with tumor staging and prognosis 43 additionally due to tumor heterogeneity a panel of biomarkers will be more useful and reliable instead of a single marker for oc early diagnosis and screening high-risk individuals 4445ctcs are a population of rare cancer cells detached from the primary tumor and shed into the bloodstream becoming the main responsible for metastases in different organs they are emerging as potential biomarkers and non-invasive alternative to tissue biopsy for the early detection diagnosis and prognosis of cancer to improve the clinical settings of patients 46 since ctcs are extremely rare cells in the blood vessels usually less than 10ml of blood their isolation from billions of red blood cells and millions of white blood cells and their accurate identification remain a challenge their heterogeneity variety of surface protein expressions sizes and physical features depending on the type and stage of cancer makes laborious their isolation requiring extremely sensitive and specific recognition methods 47 in general ctc detection includes four steps such as capture enrichment detection and the final release the capture step is based on specific interactions between ctcs and materials physical or antibodyantigen interaction the enrichment step refers to ctcs isolation from the blood the ctcs detection is generally carried out by fluorescence surface-enhanced raman scattering sers or electrical impedance measurements finally the enriched ctcs are released for further phenotype identification and molecular analyses 48 to date several technologies have been refined for ctcs detection enrichment and isolation based on chemical or physical methods such as capture by magnetic nanoparticles nps 49 mechanical separation by size difference 50 microfluidic approaches 5152 and immune-recognition methods 47among the antibody-dependent isolation procedure based on specific biomarkers recognition immunomagnetic technologies are often performed using anti-epcam antibody-functionalized magnetic nps to specifically target epcam epithelial cell adhesion molecule expressing cells the epithelial cell adhesion molecule epcam is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates cellcell adhesion in epithelial tissues since it has oncogenic potential it has been extensively used for ctc capturing to date the only fda approved ctc detection system is the cellsearch assay although the high-cost fabrication limits its use the kit is based on immunomagnetic separation to target a specific antigen by using anti-epcam antibodies coupled to magnetic beads the subsequent separation of the antigen-antibody complex can be achieved via exposure to a magnetic field 53the development of reliable cost-effective and sensitive ctc detection and isolation technologies plays a pivotal role in the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer nanomaterials offer excellent advantages to improve the sensitivity in biomolecule detection due to their high surface area to volume ratio and similar size with respect to biomolecules 54 many classes of nanomaterials have been incorporated into ctc research for highly sensitive and selective cell capture ie magnetic and gold nanoparticles carbon nanotubes dendrimers quantum dots and graphene oxide go 55 specifically recent progresses in nanoscience have allowed designing nanoarchitectures based on multifunctional g platforms for the isolation and identification of ctcs representing technological advancements in liquid biopsy 56 in fact the ease surface chemical modifications together with its unique optical properties make go an attractive material for biomolecule detection 56 and the most commonly used strategies to isolate ctcs are based on traditional immunomagnetic separation electrochemical technology and microfluidic tools 47 because of the diamagnetic feature of all untreated biological materials magnetic cell separation using bio-conjugated magnetic materials can be fruitfully applied to separate ctcs from whole blood in a highly specific way via targeted binding and subsequent separation using a bar magnet avoiding light scattering and autofluorescence background from blood cellsthe combination of graphene oxide quantum dots goqds and magnetic nanoplatforms into a single nanoarchitecture functionalized with anti-gpc3 glypican 3 antibody has been proposed for the accurate identification and selective capture of liver cancer tumor ctcs 57 an electrochemical sensing strategy based on aptamer-functionalized and gold nanoparticles array-decorated magnetic graphene nanosheet aunps-fe3o4-gs has been reported for monitoring and capturing ctcs in human whole blood the sensor takes advantage of the combination of two effects the efficient recognition and capture of the target ctcs assured by selected aptamers and the signal amplification guaranteed by the functionalization of the gold nanoparticles aunps with electroactive species 6-ferrocenyl-1-hexanethiol or thionine 58several go-based microfluidic devices have been proposed to enrich ctcs based on their distinct biochemical properties toward other human blood components most of these devices focus on immunoaffinity-based technologies which exploit specific antibodies widely expressed in cancer cells to isolate ctcs with high purity and sensitivitya microfluidic go-based chip with accurate surface capture design has been reported for isolating ctcs from metastatic breast cancer patients with high sensitivity and reproducibility the use of go as the base material for antibody conjugation enables the chip to detect ctcs from only 1 ml of blood with high yield and reproducibility due to the high-density antibody presentation 59a microfluidic device exploiting immunocapture based on a tunable thermal-sensitive polymer-go chip has been proposed for highly efficient capture and subsequent release of ctcs from breast and pancreatic cancer patients the microfluidic device is coated with a composite film of functionalized go dispersed in a thermoresponsive polymer matrix the combination of a biocompatible go properly functionalized for immunocapture with a thermosensitive polymer has provided temperature-dependent modulation of capturerelease allowing the effective cell release for post-capture analysis this device has overcome the common drawback of most immunoaffinity-based technologies reliant on antibodies attached to the capture surface hindering the release of viable cells 60 electrochemical technology is also applicable to ctc recovery a graphene-based electrochemical sensing platform based on functionalized graphene-modified glassy carbon electrodes gces has been designed to be incubated with mammalian cells ie different cancerous multidrug-resistant cancerous and metastatic human breast cells as well as artificial ctc samples the interactions with cell surface components responsible for conjugating the target cells on the electrode surface have been transduced to an ultrasensitive electrochemical response the chemical diversity offered by the graphene probes has allowed discerning different cell surfacecell type serving as a sensor array featuring selective receptors the advantage of such an array-based sensing approach relies on the possibility to make an overall signature of ctcs providing a fingerprint that allows for the classification and identification of cells 61 a porous graphene-oxide pgo has been used to decorate light addressable-potentiometric-sensor laps surface followed by the aptamer as1411 anchoring apta-pgo-laps and is investigated as a light addressable potentiometric sensor the ctc sensing interface has exploited the integration of electronic sensors with the robust and specific ctcs bioprobe aptamer specifically the aptamer probe as1411 has owned high binding affinity and specificity to the overexpressed nucleolin on the ctcs membrane 62a sensor for clinical samples ctc detection based on aptamer as1411 functionalized graphene field-effect transistor gfet by using tetra 4-aminophenyl porphyrin-mediated reduced go as the channel material has been recently proposed the aptamer sensing strategy has been applied to isolate ctcs of human lung cancer cell line a549 breast cancer mdamb-231 and cervical cancer hela with good sensitivity 63a versatile super-sandwich cytosensor based on go-modified 3d microchip and au-enwrapped silica nanocomposites siaunps fabricated by photolithography has been developed as ctc-sensitive quantitative detection system the sensor integrates two functional components 1 an anti-epcam coating on go for recognizingcapturing epcam-expressing cells and 2 horseradish peroxidase hpr and anti-ca15-3 ab2 loaded in siaunps to improve the selectivity of target cells and amplify the electrochemical detection signal the performance was assessed on mcf7 breast cancer cells showing high sensitivity with a wide range of 101 to 107 cells ml1 and a detection limit of 10 cells ml1 64 a ctc isolation platform based on go functionalized polyester fabric sheets bearing anti-epcam antibodies has been proposed as a low-cost easy-to-fit and disposable platform assuring high sensitivity capture efficiency of 7580 was obtained for cells with high epcam expressions 65a 3d hierarchical nanostructured graphene cell-captured foam with an anti-epcam coating rgoznoanti-epcam foam has been proposed for recognizingcapturing epcam-expressing cancer cells showing some advantages compared to microfluidic-based devices such as easy fabrication increased cell-substrate contact frequency in all directions microporosity which allows normal red blood cells to travel through but selectively captures ctcs due to the anti-epcam coating the performance of this 3d foam was investigated using epcam-positive cancer cell lines mcf7 breast cancer cells resulting in a cell-capture yield reaching up to 58 after an incubation time of 30 min 66for more comprehensive ctc enrichment special attention must be focused on the choice of antibodies by combining different antibodies in a single nanodevice higher capture efficiency can be achieved than that obtained by single biomarker recognition reduced graphene oxide rgo films functionalized with anti-epcam and anti-prostate specific membrane antigen anti-psma antibodies have been recently fabricated by spray coating rgo solution onto a smooth glass slide the antibody-modified rgo films exhibited a high efficiency 60 of ctc capture from the blood of prostate cancer patients with prostate-specific antigen psa levels of 410 ng ml1 67exs are a subgroup of cell-derived nano-sized 30100 nm extracellular vesicles evs that have been recently recognized as new mediators for many cellular processes and potential biomarkers for non-invasive disease diagnosis and for monitoring treatment response especially in cancer therapy mounting evidences have demonstrated the ex implication in several diseases including viral pathogenesis 68 neurodegenerative diseases 69 and cancer growth and progression 70 in particular the release of exs has been found to increase significantly in most neoplastic cells and occurs continuously at all stages of tumor development growing evidence has shown that the tumor-derived exs carry characteristic proteins and rnas in various cancer types and the expression levels of these molecules are closely correlated with tumor progression 71 besides the surface protein expression can provide invaluable information associated with the physiological states of the parental cells that is why exs are emerging as a novel disease diagnosis tool although exs share several protein markers on their membrane some of them are cell-specific and reflect the conditions of the secreting cell meaning that there is a large heterogeneity among these biological markers in a single sample of withdrawn blood this makes their isolation rather difficult up to date most of the microfluidic devices are still not compatible with clinical analysis due to scalability standardization and validation further several approaches are time-consuming require extensive pre-treatment steps and do not recover enough samples for genomic or proteomic analysis thus there is a need for isolation techniques that selectively isolate exs in a cost-effective and rapid manner 2 nevertheless the performance of common isolation methods is significantly affected by contamination from other membrane-derived subcellular structures with high similarity in physical properties resulting in very poor recovery yields numerous ex isolation techniques have been established so far including ultracentrifugation polymer-based precipitation filtration and affinity pull-down currently the most common method for ex purification is the ultracentrifugation which includes several centrifugation steps polymer-based precipitation relies on the formation of a polymer network to entangle all lipid components in the sample and to reduce their solubility for rapid removal under a low centrifugal force 727374 membrane filtration has also been applied for size-based isolation of exs but exs are prone to adhere to the filtration membranes causing sample loss moreover the additional force applied to pass the analyzed liquid through the membranes could potentially deform or damage the exs 74 affinity pull-down is superior in selective separation of exs using specific antibodies but it requires large amounts of sample volumesthe development of bio-sensors able to recognize exs without purification steps from biological samples with very high accuracy and sensitivity has recently spread among the scientific community generally they combine the specificity of immunoaffinity-based systems with functionalized nanomaterials fang et al 71 designed a hybrid platform that integrated two nanomaterials with different surface properties the hydrophilic macroporous graphene foam gf and the amphiphilic periodic mesoporous organosilica pmo the high specific surface area of gf after modification with the antibody against the ex protein marker cd63 specific exosome marker allowed highly specific isolation of exs from complex biological samples with high recovery after lysis with methanol the amphiphilic pmo was employed to rapidly recover the ex proteins including the highly hydrophobic membrane proteins peptides obtained by protein digestion were analyzed by lc-msms analysis liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry zhang et al reported a microfluidic platform based on the graphene oxidepolydopamine gopda system 75 go induced spontaneous polymerization of a 3d pda surface coating which was demonstrated to improve the efficiency of ex immuno-capture suppressing the effects of non-specific adsorption the platform was prepared by a layer-by-layer coating method figure 2 and the on-chip-captured exs were detected by fluorescence analyses after the treatment with a mixture of biotinylated antibodies cd63 cd81 and epcam streptavidin-conjugated -galactosidase sg was used as a reporter enzyme the platform performance was proved in both molecular profiling and the quantitative exs detection of purified samples from a colon cancer cell line or directly in plasma samples from ovarian cancer patients surface-enhanced raman scattering sers spectroscopy is a promising analytic tool for exs ultra-detection sers biomedical applications include two general methodologies called label-free detection and indirect approaches based on the use of a raman reporter rar linked to nobel nps commonly known as sers tags or sers-labeled nps 76 a sers tag consists of four main components 1 silver or gold nps which act as plasmonic enhancer 2 raman reporter rar acting as fingerprint label 3 a protective layer or coating shell that stabilizes the nps allowing the biomolecules grafting 4 recognition moieties noble metal nps inducing an enhanced electric field when lspr localized surface plasmon resonance is excited by selected laser light sources 16 might be considered the sers tag core the rar an organic compound with a typical spectral fingerprint ie benzenthiol 4-mercaptobenzoic acid etc ideally should cover the nps to provide a stable intense and reliable raman signal the coating component of sers-tag although not essential can improve the colloid stability and provide several advantages a prevent the rar leaching b avoid contaminations c reduce the intensity variations due to np-np interactions several protective coatings have been proposed including biomolecules ie bovine serum albumin polymers ie peg inorganic shell ie sio2 liposomes 76 and graphene 77 in the last case g acts as both a protective shell and rar specific peptides antibodies or proteins are grafted in the external layer of the sers-tag as recognition ligands of biomarkers 76circulating tumor nucleic acids ctnas such as circulating cell-free dna rna microrna figure 1 represent an innovative tool for liquid biopsy applications 27879 the ctna levels compared to other circulating free biomarkers such as ctcs are detectable early in the bloodstream therefore they can be used for the initial tumor detection and the disease monitoring 80 to date several ctna detection approaches based on fluorescence sers spectroscopy radiochemical enzymatic approach chemiluminescence have been investigated 468182 unfortunately the detection of these biomarkers is challenging due to their small size and low concentrations in body fluids 80 different ultra-sensitive detection methods including nucleic-acid sequence-based amplification 83 rolling circle amplification rca 84 and polymerase chain reaction pcr 85 have been proposed however the complexity the high cost of reagents and equipment and the time-consuming protocols prevent the translation of these strategies in the market to overcome some of these disadvantages also the electrochemical approaches characterized by a lower cost and a high detection sensitivity via signal amplification have been proposed in the last years 86go and rgo have been chosen as sensing platforms to detect circulating oligonucleotides and cells by fluorescent spectroscopy due to their ability to adsorb single-stranded ss oligonucleotides by noncovalent approaches - interactions andor hydrogen bonds 87 at the same time go and rgo have shown a lower affinity towards the double-stranded ds oligonucleotides due to poor accessibility of nucleobases inside the double helix and a lower ability to adsorb longer oligonucleotides due to lower diffusivity processes 88 moreover g materials are able to almost completely quench the fluorescence emission of the fluorescent dye linked to ss oligonucleotide in the presence of complementary target oligonucleotides circulating oligonucleotides the ss oligonucleotides marked with fluorescent dye can be released by g surface and complexed with the complementary target oligonucleotide restoring the fluorescent emission allowing the identification of the circulating oligonucleotide fragmentsa biosensing platform able to simultaneously detect and evaluate the amounts of mir-141 and mir-21 two mirnas overexpressed in the early and in the advanced stage of prostate cancer from several body fluids blood urine saliva was investigated by salih hizir et al 89 the ability of go to adsorb ss dna on its surface and to quench fluorescence emission was exploited for the design of go platform engineered with two fluorophore-labeled antisense dna strands fluorescein amidites fam-labeled anti-mir-21 and cy5-labeled anti-mir-141 the platform resulted in a fluorescent quenching at 520 nm fam channel and 670 nm cy5 channel in the presence of overexpressed mir-21 a fluorescent signal enhancement at 520 nm was observed whereas overexpressed mir-141 induced a fluorescent signal increase at 670 nm non-target mirnas induced only a lower fluorescent increase at these channels therefore the increase of fluorescent signal at 520 or 670 nm indicated the presence of mir-21 or mir-141 and the increase of intensity fluorescence signal level was used to determinate the concentration of mir-21 and mir-141 fragments the system was proposed not only to detect prostate cancer disease but also to evaluate its advancement stage unfortunately the low sensitivity and low specificity are typical problems of these nanodevices hindering their clinical application 89a new go-polymer-oligonucleotide ngo-pegmam2 and enzyme dnase i system able to detect mir-10b in an rna pool taken from metastatic breast cancer cells were reported by robertson et al 90 the insertion of a specific mismatch fragment into the probe sequence induced an increase of specificity towards mir-10b an oligonucleotide overexpressed in breast cancer the ngo-pegmam2 dnase i system was able to distinguish mir-10b from mir-10a which differed only for a single nucleotide the presence of the endonuclease dnase i improved the fluorescent sensitivity of the probe but also the background fluorescent signal to overcome this drawback the edge of go was functionalized with pegma which hindered the access of dnase i on the go surface to avoid the increase of fluorescence background signal due to undesired enzymatic activity 90the combination of the quenching properties of go and cyclic enzymatic amplification method ceam has allowed developing gossdna probes able to detect and discriminate among several mir-21 mirnas in cell lysate media the up-regulation expression of mir-21 mirnas is involved in solid tumor growth the biological media have been obtained from lung carcinoma cell line a-549 and mammary epithelial cells mcf-10a the presence of complementary mirna has induced the restoration of fluorescence due to mirnadna complex formation previously quenched by go subsequently mirna released from the dnase i digestion can complex with another ssdna probe on the go surface to start another cycle enhancing the fluorescent signal until all released ssdna probes are completely consumed 91in the presence of divalent salt go is not able to discriminate between ssnas and dsnas 92 on the contrary rgo has shown a higher selectivity towards mirna compared to go in the same adsorption conditions 93 taking into account these findings yan et al developed a magnetic system based on rgo magnetic beadsaptesrgo able to selectively adsorb mirna from the rna pool isolated from healthy human plasma 88 magnetic beads were employed to obtain a faster extraction process by centrifugation moreover in situ reverse transcriptions rt such as rolling circle amplification rca strategy were applied to desorb and detect mirna by rgo surface 88several challenges have been also focused on the detection of both circulating ssds dna ruiyi et al developed a nitrogen-doped multiple graphene aerogelgold nanostar biosensor n-doped mgagns able to detect dsdna by human serum via electrochemical approach 94 the hybrid n-doped mgagns system showed an electrocatalytic activity towards fe cn634 improved in the presence of dsdna which was demonstrated by amperometric detection the authors ascribed this behavior to the interaction between dna and under-coordinated aui sites bonded on the n-doped mga-5 surface 94 another electrochemical biosensor composed of g decorated with au nanorods and polythionine film gau nrpt deposited onto glassy carbon electrode gce was developed by huang et al for the detection of human papillomavirus hpv dna in human serum 95 g was used to enhance the surface area and the electric conductivity of the system au nrs au nanorods were employed to increase the immobilization of dna probe polythionines were selected due to their good electron transfer ability and due to their ability to bond the au nr surfaces by their amine groups the thiolated capture probes cp were immobilized on the biosensor via electrostatic interactions and aus covalent bonds cp was hybridized with one terminal of dna target td which arose from hpv-16 long terminal repeat sequences moreover two auxiliary probes ap were developed to complex td fragment to be detected in human serum by a long-range self-assembly process finally the 110-phenanthrolineruthenium dichloride ruphen32 was used as an electrochemical indicator due to its ability to bond the dna by electrostatic interactions the increase of electrochemical response signal depended on the amount of ruphen32 bonded to dna nanostructure worth noticing the two ap sequences could bond with each other on the biosensor surface giving rise to considerable lengthy self-assembled dna nanostructure only in the presence of td 95direct methods exploiting graphene nanotechnology for the rapid virus detection have been only marginally investigated in the past and no critical discussion has been reported in successive literature reviews 9697this attitude was unchanging even during sarscov-1 emergency that was responsible for the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars infection in asia causing about 8000 cases and 774 deaths also during the middle east respiratory distress syndrome mers of 2013 which affected saudi arabia causing close to 858 deaths 129899100 advances in nanotechnology have begun to play an important role in viral detection to improve the detection limit operational simplicity of viral diagnostics 78a coplanar-gate graphene field-effect transistors gfets 71 have been proposed for the detection of hiv-1 human immunodeficiency virus 1 and mlv murine leukemia virus viruses using antibodies of vesicular stomatitis indiana virus vsv as biorecognition element vsv antibodies are immobilized on the g layer using 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester pase pase binds g by - interactions anchoring the antibodys primary amine groups by the opposite succinimidyl group the formation of the virus-antibody complex leads to a downward shift of the dirac point voltage regardless of the types of detected viruses the proposed platform has worked in a wide range of concentrations from 478 am to 1055 nm but the lack of virus specificity appears the main limitation of this strategyan surface plasmon resonance spr sensor based on an polyamidoamine-functionalized rgocomposite with monoclonal antibodies immobilized on self-assembled dithiobis succinimidyl undecanoate dsu for the detectionquantification of dengue virus denv has been recently described 97the specificity and the sensibility of the sensor have been achieved by anchoring a stable biorecognition element antibodies igm against dengue type 2 envelope proteins on the gold surface of the sensor the specific binding of antibody-denv 2 e-protein allows a significant change in the angle of the reflectivity minimum that is correlated to dengue virus detection the proposed sensor has shown a sensitive and selective response towards denv 2 e-proteins compared to denv 1 e-proteins and zikv zika virus e-proteins although no g materials have been integrated into the above-described sensor 97 the criteria used for its fabrication were included in this review since the strategy could be extended to other viruses and the performance of spr noble metal could be improved in the presence of g 76differently from the past the current sanitary pandemic emergency caused by the new type of coronavirus sarscov-2 is characterized by global effort to identify biomarkers that predict the severity of covid-19 patients and to develop diagnostic tools for the rapid detection of sarscov-2 infection 101currently nucleic acid testing on respiratory specimens is the reference gold standard method for the diagnosis of covid-19 infected patients 102 the test requires a series of laboratory procedures a viral rna extraction b addition to a master mix containing nuclease-free water reverse primers a fluorophore-quencher probe and a reaction mix ie polymerase reverse transcriptase magnesium nucleotides and additives c loading of extracted rnamaster mix into a pcr thermocycler d several cycles at settled temperature during the rt-pcr cycles the cleavage of the fluorophore-quencher probe generates a fluorescent signal detected and recorded in real-time 101rt-pcr uses respiratory samples to genetically detect sarscov-2 some data have suggested that 2034 of covid-19 patients resulted negative in the test despite being infected this variance in the sensitivity could be mainly attributed to low viral load ie patients tested in the early stage of the viral disease 102 other rt-pcr issues include the time consuming and expensive analysis and the technical expertise in carrying out the textother technologies such as point-of-care technologies and serologic immunoassays are rapidly emerging to address these deficiencies 78analytic methods to assess prior infection and immunity to sarscov-2 by antibody identification are essential for epidemiologic studies although sensibility and specificity of the tests currently available in the market remain undefined cross-reactivity of antibody to nonsarscov-2 coronavirus proteins is the main issue of these serologic tests 101102 the development of an antigen detection test 102 could take advantage of progress in the production of monoclonal antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of sarscov-2 the global effort to increase sarscov-2 testing capacity takes advantage of the most recent advances in chemistry molecular biology genome technology and nanotechnology several projects are ongoing in this direction and some results are already reported in the literature 95103the detection of sarscov-2 in respiratory samples has been achieved by lspr biosensor combining the photothermal effect and plasmonic sensing transduction for sarscov-2 viral nucleic acid 103a field-effect transistor fet-based biosensing device for detecting sarscov-2 spike protein s in clinical samples was reported by seo et al 104 antibodies against s protein were anchored to the graphene sheet external coating of fet by 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester pbase figure 3the performance of the sensor is determined using antigen protein cultured virus and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from covid-19 patients the device could detect s protein at concentrations of 1 fgml in pbs and 100 fgml in the clinical transport medium and it could distinguish the sarscov-2 antigen protein from those of mers-cov the successful fabrication of a covid-19 fet sensor based on the integration of the sarscov-2 spike antibody with graphene suggests the key role of g for diagnostic scope 80 specifically the functionalization of g with diverse functional molecules 1417105106 could be the key element to tailor its properties and to obtain advanced diagnostic tools for the sarscov-2 diagnosis meanwhile for the revision of this manuscript some works dealing with sensors for covid-19 diagnosis based on graphene are reported in the literature 107 and although further researches are undoubtedly necessary the leading role of g in the worlds fight against covid-19 is clearly coming out 108in summary the biomolecules till now used to target sarscov-2 includes the viral rna the viral spike proteins and the specific immunoglobulins produced by the host immune system the biosensing community is actively working to improve portability time and cost of pcr-based sarscov-2 detection as well as to create manufacturable pcr-based microfluidic devices recently also the gene-editing technology crisprcas has been developed to overcome the issues of pcr-based systems two different detection modes have been proposed in crispr technology ie binding- or cleavage-based 109 the sensor is developed by immobilization on a graphene-based field-effect transistor gfet of cas9 with a sgrna specific to the target sequence of sars cov-2 the electrical signal originated by the binding of the target nucleic acid by the cas9sgrna complex is recorded via a simple handheld device without amplificationthe extraordinary properties of g make it a potential candidate to be routinely implemented in the design of biosensing platforms for liquid biopsy certainly the innovation in diagnosis and monitoring of severe diseases could take advantage of the most recent progress in chemistry molecular biology genome technology and nanotechnology however to give a significant contribution to the topics of great relevance for public health such as cancer-fighting neurodegenerative pathologies emerging viral diseases etc the priority of collaborative research should be mainly focused on the opportunity to clinically translate the newly identified biomarkers using nanotechnology significant advancement has been achieved in the last years however data reproducibility remains the main drawback and the selection of suitable nanomaterials for the development of devices is one of the key elements to obtain diagnostic tools that guarantee reproducible and reliable quantitative measurementsfinally the covid-19 lesson indicates that the development of diagnostics is crucial to managing the pandemic outbreak and certainly g technology will assume a prominent role in the fabrication of innovative devices for the detectionquantification of viral nucleic acidsproteins actionable for detection at the point-of-caresince its emergence in december 2019 the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak has infected over 113000 people globally with nearly 4000 deaths 1 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 produces a respiratory and systemic illness which progresses to a severe form of pneumonia in 10-15 of patients 2 severe covid-19 can lead to critical illness with acute respiratory distress ards and multi-organ failure mof as its primary complications eventually followed by intravascular coagulopathy 3 in order to optimize patient care and resource allocation during this pandemic biomarkers are urgently needed for stratifying patients risk and for actively monitoring illness severityplatelet count is a simple and readily available biomarker which is independently associated with disease severity and risk of mortality in the intensive care unit icu 4 5 6 moreover a low platelet count correlates with higher disease severity scores such as multiple organ dysfunction score mods simplified acute physiology score saps ii and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation apache ii 5 in the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak thrombocytopenia was reported to occur in up to 55 of patients and was identified as a significant risk factor for mortality 7 8 platelet count with hypoxemia were the only two variables used by zou et al for developing a sars prognostic model which displayed 962 accuracy 9 in the present study we aim to investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between covid-19 patients with or without severe disease and assess if thrombocytopenia may be associated with severe covid-19we carried out an electronic search in medline pubmed interface scopus and web of science using the keywords laboratory or platelets and coronavirus 2019 or covid-19 or 2019-ncov or sars-cov-2 between 2019 and present time ie march 6 2020 without language restriction the title abstract and full text of all documents identified using these search criteria were screened independently by two investigators gl and bmh and all documents reporting information on platelet count either the value or the rate of thrombocytopenia in covid-19 patients with a clinically validated definition of severe disease were finally included in our meta-analysis the reference list of all identified documents was scrutinized with the aim of identifying additional potentially eligible studiesa meta-analysis was performed with calculation of weighted mean difference wmd and 95 confidence interval 95 ci of platelet number in covid-19 patients with or without severe disease as well as the odds ratio or of thrombocytopenia for severe covid-19 subgroup analysis was performed based on study definition of severity the statistical analysis was performed with metaxl software version 53 epigear international pty ltd sunrise beach australia when unavailable mean and standard deviation of platelet count were extrapolated from sample size median and interquartile range iqr according to hozo et al 10 the study was carried out in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and with the term of local legislationoverall 98 documents could be initially identified based on our search criteria and from the reference lists 89 of which were excluded after title abstract or full text reading since they were review articles n8 commentaries or other editorial materials n2 they did not deal with covid-19 disease n71 or did not expressly reported the number of platelets andor the rate of thrombocytopenia in covid-19 patients with or without severe disease n8 therefore 9 studies could finally be included in our meta-analysis totaling 1779 covid-19 patients 399 of whom 224 with severe

all authors directly participated in the design of this study data collection and analysis interpretation of the results and manuscript drafting and revisionin december 2019 clusters of acute pneumonia cases of unclear etiology were identified in wuhan city the capital of hubei province in china 13 the pathogen has been reported as a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the world health organization who has made the assessment that coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 can be characterized as a pandemic because the disease is still spreading rapidly around the world especially in the united states spain and russia 4 as of may 26 a total of 82993 cases 4634 deaths were confirmed in china including 50340 cases 3869 deaths in wuhan city 5the national health commission of china has issued a series of diagnosis and treatment recommendations and suggested classifying the disease into four grades mild moderate severe and critical 5 recent studies have reported the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the varied severity grades of covid-19 1 2 68 the underlying mechanisms of the novel coronavirus leading to disease exacerbation and organ dysfunction remain to be further explored due to the high mortality and the lack of effective treatments in critically ill patients 7 9 early identification and prediction of these patients are crucial what are the risk factors for severe illness or death 10 how can we identify groups that are most likely to have poor outcomes so that we can focus prevention and treatment efforts 10 these studies are needed huang et al 8 reported that patients admitted to the intensive care unit icu had more severe clinical symptoms and more abnormal serum parameters however fewer studies have been published that confirm an early and sensitive biomarker to estimate the disease severity and prognosis of covid-19 during our clinical work against the covid-19 epidemic in wuhan we observed a high incidence of hypocalcemia in critically ill patients therefore we hypothesized that serum calcium levels were associated with the disease severity and prognosis of patients with covid-19 this study was performed to test this hypothesis and explore the causes of hypocalcemiathe median serum calcium levels were 212 iqr 204-220 mmoll on admission we divided the patients into three groups based on the serum calcium values 20 mmoll defined as group a n  43 20-22 mmoll defined as group b n  137 and 22 mmoll defined as group c n  61 as shown in table 2 significant differences in the clinical variables except for serum creatinine were found among the three groups and the same differences were found between groups a and b p 005 there were also differences in the clinical variables except for wbc count p 007 and serum creatinine p 0244 between groups a and c whereas differences in the variables except for wbc count p 060 alt p 0839 the lowest spo2 p 0328 and serum creatinine p 0635 were found between groups b and c these results indicated that patients with lower serum calcium levels had worse clinical variablesof the 241 patients 26 were tested to determine levels of parathyroid hormone pth and 25-hydroxy-vitamin d vd according to clinical needs the median serum calcium level of the 26 patients was 213 iqr 203-216 mmoll the median pth level was 5527 iqr 4273-7315 pgml and the median vd level was 1020 iqr 820-1265 ngml all of these patients had low levels of vd vd deficiencythe spss scatterplots and correlation analyses of serum calcium and the blood biomarkers are shown in figures 1 and 2 the serum calcium levels were significantly positively correlated with lymphocyte count figure 1a p 0001 albumin levels figure 1b p 0001 vd levels figure 1c p 0004 and lowest spo2 figure 1d p 0001 whereas they are significantly negatively correlated with crp figure 2a p 0001 d-dimer figure 2b p 0001 and pth figure 2c p 0048 levels these results indicated that hypocalcemia may be associated with imbalanced vd and pth in the acute phase of covid-19ards developed in 19 of 241 79 patients and liver injury developed in 16 66 aki developed in 14 58 and cardiac injury developed in 12 50 patients during the research period twelve patients received mv and 7 patients received crrt as shown in table 3 significant differences in the clinical severity and outcome variables were found among the abovementioned three groups a b and c p 0001 and between groups a and c p 0001 there were also differences in all these variables except for liver injury incidence p 0201 no differences were found between groups b and c p 005 these results indicated that patients with serum calcium values 20 mmoll had higher 28-day mortality and a higher incidence of organ injury moreover the serum calcium values were significantly lower in patients who died and in patients with mods septic shock and organ injury requiring mv or crrt p 0001 table 4roc curves were also performed to assess the associations between serum calcium and mods septic shock and 28-day mortality as shown in figure 3 the area under the curves aucs of mods figure 3a septic shock figure 3b and 28-day mortality figure 3c were 0923 p 0001 0905 p 0001 and 0929 p 0001 respectively optimal cut-off points of serum calcium values were derived from the roc curves the optimal cut-off point for mods was 2035 mmoll the sensitivity was 882 and the specificity was 826 the optimal cut-off point for septic shock was 201 mmoll the sensitivity was 1000 and the specificity was 843 the optimal cut-off point for 28-day mortality was 201 mmoll the sensitivity was 1000 and the specificity was 857 figure 4 shows the significant differences in the 28-day mortality among groups a b and c the 28-day mortality of group a was significantly higher than that of groups b or c p 0001 no difference was found between groups b and c p 005this clinical retrospective study investigated the correlations between serum calcium and clinical severity and outcomes in patients with covid-19 the incidence of hypocalcemia was 747 we found that patients with lower serum calcium levels especially 20 mmoll had worse clinical variables higher incidences of mods and septic shock and higher 28-day mortality hypocalcemia may be associated with imbalanced vd and pth in the acute phase of covid-19 the overall mortality was 41 10241 whereas the mortality of critically ill patients was increased to 400 1025the who declared that covid-19 was a pandemic because the disease is still spreading rapidly around the world 4 more than 5700000 patients have been diagnosed with covid-19 worldwide and nearly 360000 have died 4 although the national health commission of china and the who have issued a series of diagnosis and treatment recommendations the mortality of critically ill patients is still extremely high the underlying mechanisms of the novel coronavirus causing organ dysfunction are yet unknown it is crucial to identify the risk factors for severe illness or death 10 however few reports have been published to establish an early and sensitive biomarker to predict the disease severity and prognosis of covid-19 in this study we found that serum calcium levels were associated with the disease severity and prognosis of patients with covid-19hypocalcemia is common in critically ill patients the causes of hypocalcemia include oversecretion of pth vd deficiency decreased dietary intake hypoproteinemia hypomagnesemia drug interactions and so on 15 hypocalcemia was defined as a serum calcium level less than 22 mmoll in our clinical laboratory at present there is no specific severity grading system for hypocalcemia previous studies reported that serum calcium levels less than approximately 20 mmoll were associated with worse clinical outcomes in critically ill patients 1517 therefore we divided patients into three groups based on serum calcium values of 20 mmoll 20-22 mmoll and 22 mmoll we found that patients with serum calcium values 20 mmoll had higher 28-day mortality and a higher incidence of organ injury the findings of this study were consistent with previous reports however this was the first study to investigate the correlations between serum calcium and clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19 these results suggested that correcting hypocalcemia could be an important strategy to improve the prognosis of patients with covid-19 especially for patients with serum calcium values less than 2 mmoll in addition our study also revealed that hypocalcemia was associated with hypoproteinemia and imbalanced vd and pth in the acute phase of covid-19 hypoproteinemia and vd deficiency were also common and correlated with increased mortality in critically ill patients 18 19 therefore improvement of hypoproteinemia and imbalanced hormone levels may also be useful in the treatment of covid-19increased crp alt tni and d-dimer levels and lymphocytopenia were present in most critical covid-19 patients 2 7 8 our results also showed that patients with lower serum calcium values had higher levels of crp alt tni and d-dimer and lower lymphocyte counts the serum calcium values were significantly correlated with lymphocyte count and crp and d-dimer levels moreover crp and d-dimer were also indicators to predict the prognosis of critically ill patients 19 the findings of this study were consistent with previous reports and confirmed that serum calcium levels were associated with the disease severity and prognosis of patients with covid-19 the lung is the main organ affected by this disease in this study the median lowest spo2 was 970 iqr 960-980 range 80-99 and the spo2 values were significantly positively correlated with serum calcium levels patients with serum calcium values 20 mmoll had higher ards incidence while patients with ards also had lower serum calcium values these phenomena indicated that hypocalcemia might be crucial in the development of ards early diagnosis and treatment of hypocalcemia may alleviate organ injury in the acute phase of covid-19some limitations of the study should be discussed because of our single-center retrospective design and small sample size the results might be inconclusive and the accuracy should be confirmed by large-scale prospective clinical studies moreover because the study was not based on pathophysiological models the results were hypothesis generating and the exact mechanisms of hypocalcemia and vd deficiency should be tested by more fundamental experiments in addition the values of serum calcium were of total calcium rather than ionized calcium in this study which may not precisely reflect the extent of decreased calciumin conclusion this retrospective clinical study found that the incidence of hypocalcemia and vd deficiency was very high in patients with covid-19 hypocalcemia may be associated with imbalanced vd and pth levels patients with lower serum calcium levels especially 20 mmoll had worse clinical variables higher incidences of mods and septic shock and higher 28-day mortality the overall mortality of covid-19 was 41 whereas the mortality of critically ill patients was 400from february 10 to february 28 2020 adult patients age 18 years with confirmed covid-19 admitted to our specialized isolation units tongji hospital of huazhong university of science and technology in wuhan were enrolled in this clinical retrospective study patients with chronic organ dysfunction eg hepatic or renal dysfunction terminal cancer immunodeficiency and a history of long-term use of hormones were excluded written informed consent was waived by our institutional review board because this was a retrospective study that assessed deidentified data and included no potential risk to patients the diagnosis of covid-19 was made according to the who interim guidance and the recommendations of the national health commission of china 4 5 and confirmed by rna detection of sars-cov-2 in the clinical laboratory of tongji hospitalan identified case of covid-19 was defined as a positive finding by real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens 4 5 7 only laboratory-confirmed cases were enrolled in the analysis the clinical

risk of mortality 11 the diagnostic criteria of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards were in accordance with the berlin definitions 12 the definitions of acute kidney injury aki were based on the 2012 kidney disease improving global outcomes kdigo guidelines 13 cardiac injury was defined if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers eg troponin i were more than twice the reference upper limit or new abnormalities were found in electrocardiography and echocardiography 2 liver injury was defined if serum levels of hepatic biomarkers eg alanine aminotransferase were more than twice the reference upper limit or if there was disproportionate elevation of alanine aminotransferase alt and aspartate aminotransferase ast levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels 14 multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods was defined as the combined dysfunction of two or more organsthe baseline clinical characteristics including age sex days from onset to admission initial symptoms or signs and clinical classifications were collected from electronic medical records and all laboratory tests were performed according to the clinical needs of patients the levels of serum calcium c-reactive protein crp alt albumin creatinine troponin i tni and plasma d-dimer and white blood cell wbc count lymphocyte count and the lowest spo2 within 24 hours of admission were recorded the hormone levels associated with blood calcium eg parathyroid hormone 25-hydroxy-vitamin d were also recorded all blood parameters were detected by the clinical laboratory of tongji hospital moreover the numbers of patients with ards aki cardiac injury liver injury septic shock and mods and patients receiving noninvasive ventilation niv high-flow nasal cannula hfnc mv and continuous renal replacement therapy crrt were also recorded the primary endpoints were the development of septic shock mods and 28-day mortality the secondary endpoints were the other disease severity parameters eg organ injury or notthe kolmogorov-smirnov test was first performed to test the normal distribution of the data normally distributed data were expressed as the means  standard deviation and were compared by t tests abnormally distributed data were expressed as the medians interquartile ranges iqr and were compared by the mann-whitney u test or the kruskal-wallis test categorical variables were presented as absolute numbers or percentages and were analyzed using the 2 test or fishers exact test to take into account the repeated nature of the variables analysis of variance anova for repeated measurements of the general linear model was implemented receiver operating characteristic roc curves were used to evaluate the associations between serum calcium and septic shock mods and 28-day mortality ibm statistical package for the social sciences spss version 220 ny usa software was used for statistical analysis and p 005 was considered statistically significant spss scatterplots and a correlation analysis were performed to evaluate the relevance between serum calcium and blood biomarkers the statistical methods of this study were reviewed by qiao liu a biostatistician from the center for disease control and prevention of jiangsu province in chinacoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is now a global pandemic that is challenging modern medicine in many aspects 1 the disease initially presents as a mild respiratory illness developing into viral interstitial pneumonia which may in turn further progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure mof in 10-15 of adults 2interestingly the course of the disease in children is generally mild compared to that seen in adults for reasons that are yet to be clearly elucidated 3 nonetheless severe and fatal cases have been reported in children and are expected to continue to increase with the growing community transmission and overall current disease prevalence in fact a recent report from china on 2143 children with suspected covid-19 described a particularly concerning rate of severe disease in young children stratified by several age sub-categories 4 specifically the proportions of severe and critical cases by age group were 106 for 1 years 73 for 1-5 years 42 for 6-10 years 41 for 11-15 years and 30 for 16 years 4in a previous report we briefly summarized the laboratory findings reported in the early case studies from china on children with covid-19 which despite the limited sample at the time clearly suggested that children with covid-19 have different laboratory profiles compared with adult patients 3 although a limited number of pediatric cases continue to be described in the current literature the growing number of such reports allowed us to conduct this updated data synthesis in this pooled analysis of literature data we report the most common laboratory abnormalities observed in children with covid-19 moreover because sex and age have been shown to factor into incidence and outcomes of covid-19 in adults we also compared the laboratory findings across different age subgroups and across the sexes in children with covid-19 finally for children with severe disease we summarized the most frequently observed laboratory abnormalities highlighting the biomarkers that may be the best indicators at present to monitor disease severityan electronic search of medline pubmed interface scopus web of science and china national knowledge infrastructure cnki was performed using the keywords children

were applied the reference lists of all identified potentially relevant studies were reviewed to identify any additional eligible studies this systematic review and meta-analysis was reported in conformity with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelines supplement 1all studies were evaluated for inclusion by two independent reviewers each reviewer screened the titles and abstracts of retrieved references for relevance and possible eligibility full texts were then retrieved for references deemed eligible by at least one reviewer and screened for inclusion studies were deemed eligible for inclusion if they were case reports case series or observational studies that report clear and extractable data on laboratory findings in rt-pcr confirmed cases of covid-19 in pediatric patients editorials and reviews were excluded cases of the multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children mis-c potentially linked to covid-19 were not included in this investigation studies in the chinese language were evaluated by a medical professional fluent in both chinese and english who translated the article into english when data on laboratory parameters in children were reported in these studies inter-reviewer disagreements were resolved by discussion among the reviewers and in certain cases with a third author given the limited data available to date on pediatric covid-19 cases we decided to include single case reports and case series as a result we did not assess the risk of bias or grade the level of the generated evidencetwo reviewers independently extracted data from the included studies which covered the following information study authors sample size country of study sex and mean age of participants disease severity and laboratory tests performed with their corresponding values the primary outcome was frequency of laboratory abnormalities with mean laboratory values being collected whenever available to allow for comparisons between different age and sex groups individual patient data was also extracted whenever possible when the mean and standard deviations sds of laboratory values were not reported we extrapolated these values from sample size median and interquartile range iqr using the method suggested by hozo et al 5 additional data was sought from original study authors when appropriate severe disease was defined in our analysis as having any of the following hypoxemia oxygen saturation of 92 central cyanosis acute respiratory distress syndrome ards need for ventilation support need for vital life support need for intensive care unit icu support or any combination of these mild disease was defined as covid-19 with any severity below that as defined for severestudies were grouped into two separate cohorts for analyses a mild cohort and a severe cohort which include studies reporting relevant data on children having mild and severe covid-19 respectively for the mild cohort a meta-analysis was performed to calculate pooled prevalence estimates ppe with their 95 confidence interval 95 ci for each of the laboratory parameters reported in the relevant studies laboratory data was pooled whenever two or more studies reported a specific variable for some parameters appropriately only increased or decreased values were reported by the studies as such ppe represents prevalence estimate percentage of patients outside the normal ranges for a given value increased andor decreased laboratory values were defined according to the cut-off values reported in their corresponding study to accommodate for any heterogeneity arising from using different cut-offs or measuring methods in the different studies a random effects model was applied heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using the chi-square test and the i2 statistic for the chi-square test significant heterogeneity among studies is indicated by a cochrans q p-value of 010 as for the i2 statistic heterogeneity was classified as results were interpreted as 25 50 and 75 representing low moderate and high heterogeneity respectively 6given that sex and age have each been found to affect covid-19 severity and outcomes subgroup analyses were performed to compare mean lab values by age 1 vs 1 year and sex female vs male using inverse variance we calculated a weighted mean difference wmd with a 95 ci for each laboratory parameter assessed in each of these subgroups statistical analysis was performed using the metaxl software version 53 epigear international pty ltd sunrise beach australia due to the nature of the included studies ie case reports and case series mainly and the types of outcomes evaluated in this analysis we did not investigate publication biasadditionally given the limited number of studies reporting laboratory abnormalities in children with severe covid-19 with available ones showing marked variability across patients we did not conduct a meta-analysis for studies evaluating severe covid-19 patients instead we only descriptively report the findings on such patients in a summary of findings tablesupplementary figure 2 shows the flow diagram for this review after removing duplicate references a total of 553 articles were identified for title and abstract screening among these 117 were excluded for being review articles 292 for not reporting data on covid-19 44 for not providing lab data on pediatric patients with covid-19 and 79 for being editorials andor commentaries when we screened the reference lists of the 21 remaining articles eligible for inclusion we identified three additional eligible studies as a result our final pooled analysis included 24 studies which together covered a total of 624 laboratory-confirmed pediatric cases of covid-19 reporting data on 27 different laboratory parameters 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 all studies were from china except for two one from the united states 17 and the other from italy 30 the age of patients ranged from 0 to 175 years old in these studies with females accounting for around 43 of the pooled cohort three patients with severe disease were included in the mild cohort analysis as data was not able to be removed individually the basic characteristics of the included studies are summarized in table 1
twenty out of the 24 included studies totaling 610 pediatric patients with mild covid-19 reported on laboratory abnormalities7 9 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 19 20 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 their pooled results are presented in table 2
with their corresponding forest plots in supplement 3 the most common hematologic aberration was a decreased neutrophil count with ppe of 38 95 ci 19-60 elevations in the levels of c-reactive protein crp procalcitonin pct and lactate dehydrogenase ldh were also seen with ppes of 18 26 and 28 respectively interestingly creatine kinase-mb ck-mb was also elevated in one-third of patients ppe 33 95 ci 25-42 heterogeneity varied between the parameters analyzed but trended higher for inflammatory biomarkerssubgroup analyses by age and sex are presented in table 3 table 4
 respectively with respect to age infants 1 year had significantly higher leukocyte lymphocyte and platelet counts along with elevated aspartate aminotransferase ast alanine aminotransferase alt and ldh levels without any of these changes being significant however they had significantly reduced hemoglobin and creatinine levels no differences were observed with respect to crp pct or ck-mb relatively lower heterogeneity was observed for the age-specific subgroup analyses suggesting that laboratory findings are influenced by age with infants having a slightly different biochemical presentation compared with children older than 1 year of age with respect to sex females had significantly higher leukocyte and neutrophil counts with lower ck levels compared with males here too heterogeneity trended lower for several variables suggesting that sex may also account for the variability observed for some variables in the main analysisonly 6 out of the 24 included studies covering a total of 14 pediatric patients addressed laboratory abnormalities in children with severe covid-19 8 10 17 21 26 27 table 5
summarizes the characteristics and laboratory findings of these studies given the limited data and high variation across these studies we did not analytically pool their data together nonetheless certain trends could be noted from generally observing their reported findings and deserve to be mentioned alterations in leukocyte count were observed at lower-than-expected frequency with few patients having elevated counts 416 25 interestingly increased and decreased lymphocyte count were observed at equal frequency 187 in 2 studies n9 patients 10 21 that reported lymphocyte subsets 444 of patients had an increase in cd4 cell counts with only 1 patient 111 increased cd8 cell count however 666 69 had decreased counts of natural killer cells when reported crp 5 studies n13 615 pct 4 studies n11 727 and ldh 3 studies n11 727 were commonly elevated only 2 studies n9 patients reported on cytokines 10 21 with interleukin-10 il-10 being the most frequently elevated cytokine seen in up to 75 of cases il-6 and interferon-gamma ifn-gamma were also elevated though in only 37 and 25 of cases respectively all other cytokine levels were normal though only reported in one severe case report ck-mb and troponin was elevated in congruence with our observations of frequently elevated ck-mb in 13rd of the mild cohort additionally a trend of elevated d-dimer and prothrombin time pt could also be seen in severe casesalthough laboratory abnormalities in adults with mild and severe covid-19 have been widely reported and appear to be somewhat consistent little is known about the laboratory findings in children with covid-19 while the disease burden seems to be significantly lower in the pediatric population with many children being almost completely asymptomatic or only mildly affected the number of cases continues to increase recent data has shown that up to 10 of infants testing positive for covid-19 may be at risk for developing severe disease that necessitates supplemental oxygen and other aggressive interventions 4 nonetheless the majority of laboratory data on covid-19 pediatric patients stems from case reports and case series with very few small-sized observational studies contributing such data thus given that data on children with covid-19 is lacking and urgently needed to inform patient care we conducted this pooled analysis in the hope that we may provide some insights into the expected laboratory abnormalities or trends for this cohort

provides a summary of the most common laboratory abnormalities seen in children with mild and severe covid-19 overall children with mild disease have relatively few laboratory changes leukocyte count is elevated with a ppe of only 13 with an inconsistent overall pattern of derangement in white blood cell wbc indices in this category compared with adults having mild disease 31 unlike a summary of 80 laboratory-confirmed pediatric cases of sars that observed leukopenia in 47 of cases the ppe for leukopenia was only 19 in this study 32 moreover while neutropenia and lymphopenia were reported in 52 and 46 of sars cases respectively the generated ppes corresponding to these abnormalities in our study were 38 and 17 respectively these changes emphasize notable differences between sars and mild covid-19 in children despite the high genetic and molecular similarity between the two underlying viruses 32 in influenza leukopenia is common occurring in 13rd of hospitalized children however when compared to covid-19 a similar rate of leukocytosis 3-10 and neutropenia 14-26 are observed in influenza 33of interest crp was not found to be as frequently elevated in mild covid-19 cases as would be expected yielding a ppe of only 18 in children hospitalized with influenza the rate of elevated crp ranges from 37-67 33 in contrast we found an elevation in pct level of 26 ppe suggesting the possibility of a secondary bacterial infection in children hospitalized with covid-19 pneumonia this is higher than that noted in children hospitalized with influenza in which pct elevations were noted in 6-12 33 importantly bacterial and viral co-infections at the time of admission have been reported as being common in children with covid-19 24 in adults elevated pct was found to be associated with a nearly 5-fold increased risk of severe disease 34 hence we propose serially monitoring pct levels in children hospitalized with covid-19 as a potential biomarker of bacterial super-infection either pulmonary or systemic and consequent clinical deteriorationadditionally ck-mb levels were found to be increased over local thresholds in one-third of mild pediatric cases of covid-19 which resembles the case of adults with covid-19 in whom acute cardiac injury demonstrated as elevated cardiac biomarkers has been reported as a common finding that is associated with poorer outcomes as such the elevated ck-mb level may suggest either viral infiltration of cardiac tissue which is among the organs known to express the viral receptor ie angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 or cardiac ischemia due to the frequent intravascular coagulopathy that is seen with this enigmatic disease while the data on ck-mb presents potential evidence of cardiac damage in children affected by covid-19 more sensitive and specific cardiac biomarkers like cardiac troponins both ctni and t need to be measured in a pediatric cohort recently a new hyperinflammatory shock phenomenon referred to as mis-c has been reported in children and is likely associated with covid-19 in these patients significant cardiac dysfunction and high levels of troponins have been observed 35 as such we suggest that clinicians regularly monitor cardiac troponins in hospitalized children with covid-19 as a likely indicator of ongoing or imminent cardiac injurywhen we conducted a subgroup analysis in children with mild covid-19 by age increased leukocyte counts ldh levels and liver enzymes were noted in infants ie 1 year this may reflect a higher viral burden in this age group given that infants have been reported to have higher risk of developing severe disease importantly low heterogeneity was observed when comparing laboratory values across different age groups suggesting that age may explain some of the differences seen between the various laboratory variables included in the primary analysismoreover since males have been reported to exhibit higher severity and mortality with covid-19 compared with females across all age groups with numerous hypotheses attempting to explain this sex-specific discrepancy such as differences in ace2 expression heterogeneous immune responses presence of co-morbidities and sex hormones variabilities we also conducted a subgroup analysis by sex to check for such discrepancies in the pediatric population 36 paradoxically our pooled analyses showed that female children actually have higher leukocyte and neutrophil counts as well as ldh levels compared with males all other parameters had low or non-significant differences between the sexes
table 6 highlights the most common laboratory findings in children with severe covid-19 despite the limited data on this category of patients we were able to note some meaningful trends first unlike the case of adults with severe covid-19 who show significant lymphopenia a near equal frequency of increased and decreased lymphocyte counts were seen in children with severe covid-19 with the majority having normal counts in a limited analysis of t-lymphocyte subsets 44 of patients showed an increase in cd4 cell counts because lymphopenia and immune dysregulation may impact disease severity the differences between children and adults require further investigation especially because sars-cov-2 has been found capable of directly infecting t-lymphocytes which may be the mechanism underlying this lymphopenia 37 lymphopenia in adults has been shown to correlate with increased risk of in-hospital mortality whilst this association remains to be tested in pediatric patients 31 however it may be possible that the relative immaturity of the immune system in young children accounts for differences in viral susceptibility or response to infection possibly explaining the differences in laboratory trends seen in the pediatric versus adult population of covid-19 patients 3 overall based on our analysis leukocyte indices do not appear to be reliable indicators of disease severity in childrenchildren with severe covid-19 showed somewhat consistent trends of elevated ldh crp and pct levels similar to what has been reported in adult patients with covid-19 31 additionally trends of elevated d-dimer and pt were noted in children with severe covid-19 although these variables have not been consistently measured across studies nonetheless these also overlap with findings reported in adult patients which have been suggested as markers of the recently highlighted hypercoagulability status seen in patients with severe disease 37it is worth mentioning that further information on other biomarkers that may help in covid-19 prognostication such as il-6 and serum ferritin levels remains limited in children only two studies reported data on il-6 in covid-19 with none reporting data on serum ferritin of note il-6 was only elevated in 375 of severe pediatric cases additional studies should therefore incorporate measurements of il-6 given that this biomarker is commonly elevated in viral respiratory tract infections and perhaps plays an important role in the cytokine storm seen with the disease which may make it part of a risk stratification test 3 in children aged less than 5 years with severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation elevated il-6 is in fact associated with increased mortality 38 interestingly il-10 levels were elevated in 75 of severe cases reported in two studies included in this review il-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine which at high levels may contribute to or reflect a state of immunoparalysis in critically ill children increasing the risk for secondary nosocomial infections 39 this further supports the importance of serially monitoring pct levels in children hospitalized with severe disease the use of il-10 as a measure of pediatric disease severity should also be further investigated in future studiesthe major limitation of this study is the small number of relevant references that could be included and their erratically observational nature in fact it is imperative to keep in mind when interpreting our results that our pooled analyses included case reports and case series which reduce our level of confidence in the generated estimates nonetheless we provide in this report the most comprehensive summary to date on the laboratory abnormalities seen in children with covid-19 the heterogeneity detected in our primary analyses could be explained by different influences of age and sex as differences were noted in subgroup analyses moreover heterogeneity may stem from differences among studies with regards to their outcome measures such as the timing of specimen collection and measurement assays used which were not clearly described in most of the included studies lastly as reference ranges and cut-offs used in the pediatric population for laboratory measures are traditionally heterogenous and may differ from institution to institution this may partially explain the elevated levels of heterogeneity see for some measurements importantly however as leukocyte indices appear to be unreliable markers of disease severity based on early data urgent identification of reliable prognostic biomarkers should be a top priority of future studies in this populationdespite the increasing number of pediatric covid-19 cases little is known about the laboratory profiles of these patients based on data available to date within the literature alterations in leukocyte indices appear to be mostly inconsistent in children unlike the case of adults with covid-19 therefore leukocyte indices in children do not appear to be reliable markers of disease severity instead we propose that physicians serially monitor crp pct and ldh levels to monitor the course of the disease in children hospitalized with covid-19 finally elevated ck-mb levels in children with mild covid-19 suggest the possibility of cardiac injury highlighting the importance of monitoring cardiac biomarkers in hospitalized patients and the need for further investigation in future studiesthis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectorsnonevarious studies have been carried out to find out the etiology of kawasaki disease kd viral infection is thought to be one of the causes of kd but it is still controversial1234 although several potential viral causes of kd are identified the diagnosis of kd with concomitant viral infection is a little unclear to confirm kdadenoviral infection is frequently involved in young children less than 3 years and is characterized with prolonged high fever upper and lower respiratory tract symptom conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptom with hepatic involvement inflammatory biomarker such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and c-reactive protein crp levels are mostly elevated in patients with adenoviral infection because of strong inflammatory response adenoviral infection closely resembles bacterial infection and kd5678 although the majority patients of adenoviral infection presented respiratory condition extrapulmonary manifestation of conjunctivitis skin rash mucous membrane changes cervical lymphadenopathy and encephalitis can be associated the various clinical manifestation of adenovirus infections are particularly similar to kd regarding the clinical aspects910111213a recent study demonstrated the distinction of clinical and virologic characteristics of adenoviral infection differentiating from kd with incidental adenoviral detection14 because of clinical similarities early and acute diagnosis and intravenous immunoglobulin ivig therapy are essential to prevent coronary artery abnormalities in kd the aim of this study is to compare the clinical and laboratory characteristics of kd patients with adenovirus detection and those with only adenoviral infection and to identify biomarkers that can differentiate kd from adenovirus infections at the initial hospitalization stage in addition we also assessed the clinical and laboratory distinction of kd with adenovirus from kd without adenovirus infectionwe conducted a retrospective study from august 2012 to june 2016 a total of 129 patients with kd were diagnosed during this period the diagnosis of kd was established in patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of kd typical kd was diagnosed in the presence of fever for at least 5 days combined with at least 4 of the 5 following clinical features the lip and tongue change bilateral bulbar conjunctivitis skin rash erythema and edema of the hands and feet and cervical lymphadenopathy with diameter of 15 cm incomplete kd was diagnosed if the patients had symptoms that were associated with kd met the inflammatory biomarker criteria15among 129 kd patients respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction was performed in 107 patients respiratory virus panel included influenza a and b adenovirus parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4 respiratory syncytial virus types a and b bocavirus types 1 through 4 coronavirus nl 63 oc 43 and 229e enterovirus human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus types a b and cin addition we retrospectively analyzed 147 patients with isolated adenoviral infection the most common symptoms were fever more than 4 days 813 cough 732 sputum 688 rhinorrhea 652 the most common diagnosis at admission was acute pharyngotonsillitis 573 followed by pneumonia 161 bronchiolitis 125 and gastroenteritis 59 the pharyngoconjunctival fever was initially diagnosed in 12 patients 82we compared 147 patients with adenoviral infection and 11 patients with kd with adenovirus detection in addition we also compared 11 patients with kd with adenovirus and 87 kd without adenovirus detection this study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of hallym university kangdong sacred heart hospital kangdong 2018-01-004 written informed consent was obtained from all patientsall patients with kd were examined for inflammatory markers such as total white blood cell count neutrophil count neutrophillymphocyte ratio esr crp lactate dehydrogenase ld and b-type natriuretic peptide bnpin addition other laboratory findings such as hemoglobin serum sodium serum albumin aspartate aminotransferase ast alanine aminotransferase alt and urinalysis were also assessed however bnp was not detected in most patients with isolated adenoviral infectionregarding the criteria of typical kd15 the acute clinical features such as conjunctival injection lip and tongue changes skin rash cervical lymphadenopathy and changes in extremities were also evaluatedall of the kd patients were initially treated with ivig 2 gkg for 12 hours and additionally treated with ivig in case of ivig resistance ivig resistance was defined as a persistent or recrudescent fever for 48 hours after initial ivig completion in the case of recurrent or persistent fever with twice ivig therapy we managed with the fever with methylprednisolon pulse therapy or infliximab after the acute phase all patients have been given low dose aspirin for 8 weeks low dose aspirin was discontinued unless the coronary artery abnormalities persistedin all patients with kd transthoracic echocardiography was performed to define the involvement of the coronary arteries during the acute phase and also at an outpatient clinic at 23 weeks and 8 weeks the coronary abnormalities analysis by echocardiography was performed off-line retrospectively echocardiographic recording at 3 different times was reviewed in each patient measurement were conducted at the left main coronary artery the left anterior descending artery and the right coronary artery to identify the coronary abnormalities we assessed the z value of coronary arteries according to the body surface area we defined the coronary abnormalities as a coronary z score of more than 25 the presence of wall irregularity no acute tapering of the coronary artery branch and saccular or diffuse coronary aneurysm15continuous variables were expressed as the median interquartile range and categorical variables as either a number or a percentage for continuous variables the comparisons were performed using mann-whitney u test categorical variables were compared using fishers exact test or chi-square analysis as appropriate multivariate analysis was performed to detect the independent variables associated with kd with adenoviral detection using all parameters with a p value005 via univariate analysis the area under the receiver operating characteristics roc curve was used to evaluate the discrimination of kd with adenoviral detection from isolated adenoviral infection and then to derive sensitivity and specificity values for crp the cutoff value of crp parametric variable was determined by roc curve a p-value 005 was considered statistically significantvarious kinds of virus were detected in 42 out of 107 392 patients in kd fig 1 showed the virus distribution of kd in virus positive patients rhinovirus was the most commonly detected 405 additionally 12 adenoviruses were identified in kd two patients had coinfection rsv type b and rhinovirus in 1 patient and adenovirus and coronavirus in 1 patient we excluded 1 adenovirus patient with co-infection of coronavirusamong 129 patients with kd adenovirus without coinfection was identified in 11 patients baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics of kd with adenoviral detection are shown in table 1 the median age of these patients was 36 months range 5109 months nine patients 818 were diagnosed as typical kd most of the kd patients had 4 or more clinical symptoms satisfying the kd criteria and 2 incomplete kd patients had 3 clinical features of kd accompanied by coronary artery abnormalities in the laboratory findings crp was more than 50 mgl as a whole bnp was found to be higher than 100 pgml in only 3 patients astalt elevation more than 45 iul was detected in 3 patients and sterile pyuria defined as 10 wbchigh-power field was shown in 6 patients four patients had developed coronary artery abnormalitieswe compared 11 patients with kd with adenovirus and 147 patients with isolated adenoviral infection table 2 showed the comparison of clinical and laboratory variables between the 2 groups in patients with kd with adenovirus detection the median fever duration was 6 days and was not different from isolated adenoviral infection group p0356 regarding the clinical features of kd lip and tongue changes and skin rash and changes in extremities were more frequently demonstrated in the kd with adenoviral detection group than the adenoviral infection group 818 vs 156 p0001 in lip and tongue changes 727 vs 367 p0007 in skin rash 636 vs 102 p0001 in changes in extremities we also compared the differences in laboratory parameters between the 2 groups there were significant differences in crp 675 585781 mgl vs 319 192481 mgl p0002 hypoalbuminemia 91 vs 07 p0009 and the presence of sterile pyuria 545 vs 109  p0001 between the kd with adenovirus group and the isolated adenoviral infection group in addition the neutrophillymphocyte ratio had the borderline statistical significance p0053 there were however no significant differences in wbc count esr ld hyponatremia or astalt between the 2 groupsby multivariate logistic regression analysis lip and tongue changes odds ratio or 1416 95 confidence interval ci 11511741 p0001 crp or 1039 95 ci 17431454 p0021 and sterile pyuria or 1052 95 ci 08611286 p0041 were independent predictors of kd with adenoviral detection table 3the cutoff value of crp that differentiated adenovirus-positive kd from isolated adenoviral infection was 56 mgl which resulted in a sensitivity of 818 and a specificity of 759 fig 2in a total of 129 patients with kd the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with kd who were adenovirus positive n11 were compared with those who were adenovirus-negative n87 we excluded the patients with other virus isolation n31 in the adenovirus-negative group the age sex and fever duration did not differ between patient groups fourteen patients 161 in the adenovirus-negative kd group were diagnosed with incomplete kd compared with 2 patients 222 in the adenovirus-positive kd group there were no statistically significant differences in the clinical manifestation of kd and laboratory parameters between the two groups in addition coronary artery complications were not different between the 2 groups 364 4 of 11 vs 333 29 of 87 p0868our findings demonstrate that lip and tongue changes higher serum crp level and sterile pyuria were significantly related to the adenovirus-positive kd differentiating from isolated adenoviral infection the cutoff crp level was 56 mgl with 818 sensitivity and 759 specificity the development of coronary artery abnormalities was not different between the adenovirus positive group and adenovirus negative group in kd patientsthis study demonstrated the clinical and laboratory characteristics of kd with incidental adenoviral detection that may help differentiate isolated adenoviral infection although the clinical features of adenovirus-positive kd are similar to an isolated adenoviral infection adenoviral-positive kd usually had frequent lip and tongue change skin rash and changes in extremities compared to adenoviral infection however cervical lymphadenopathy was not differently observed between the 2 groups in the present study crp hypoalbuminemia and sterile pyuria could be differentiated between the adenovirus-positive kd group and adenoviral infection group in addition the cutoff crp level of 56 mgl aids in the discrimination of diagnosis of kd from adenoviral infection this distinct clinical and laboratory pattern was characteristic of adenovirus positive kd however high crp level could also be observed in adenoviral infection with secondary bacterial infection although the american heart association guidelines suggest that a crp 30 mgl or esr 40 mmhr may consider incomplete kd15 a recent study demonstrated that a crp 30 mgl has a lack specificity for kd additionally a higher crp 70 mgl suggesting the discrimination of kd from adenoviral infection was consistently observed in the kd group14previous studies investigated viral etiology in kd and the role of viral infection associated with kd several potential viruses including rhinovirus coronavirus parainfluenza virus human metapneumovirus and adenovirus were detected in kd patients1234 in contrast no association of coronavirus and bocavirus with kd was demonstrated in the other study16although the relationship between virus and kd was not precisely identified clinical presentation of adenovirus still mimics kd9101112 it remains to be determined whether this virus causes kd with triggering pathophysiology leading to similar clinical features as adenoviral infection this study has several important clinical implications the early differential diagnosis of kd from adenoviral infection was important to prevent inadvertent coronary artery complications the suggested clinical features and inflammatory markers could be useful in differentiating kd from isolated adenoviral infection in the early period of disease in addition other inflammatory markers such as bnp and procalcitonin should be assessed because no specific inflammatory biomarker was established during the acute phasehowever there were no significant differences in clinical and laboratory findings between the adenovirus-positive and adenovirus-negative kd groups the development of coronary artery abnormalities was also not different therefore the adenovirus detection could not be excluded in kd but might not affect the occurrence of coronary artery abnormalitiesa better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of virus associated kd and detection of specific biomarkers of kd are crucial to diagnose and treat without untoward coronary complicationsalthough we found clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters differentiating adenovirus-positive kd from isolated adenoviral infection no specific adenoviral type was identified in 11 patients with adenovirus-positive kd in addition there was no relationship between adenoviral detection and coronary artery abnormality in kdin the study we did not routinely examine for bnp in the adenoviral infection so we could not assess the difference between the 2 groupsthis was a retrospective study and we evaluated a relatively small number of adenovirus-positive kd patients further prospective studies with larger numbers of patients are warranted to confirm our resultsdespite the similarities between kd and adenoviral infection clinical and laboratory features can be used to differentiate kd with incidental adenoviral detection from adenoviral infection serum crp can be used as a biomarker to predict kd from isolated adenoviral infection at the early stage of hospitalizationthe concept of microarrays was developed from an earlier concept termed ambient analyte immunoassay first introduced by roger ekins in 1989 in the following decade microarrays were first successfully realized as dna or oligonucleotide microarrays which allowed the quantification of the mrna expression levels of thousands of genes in parallel this technology has changed many aspects of biological research though extremely successful the chemistry of dna hybridization precludes its application for studying proteins which are considered the major driving force in cells consistent with this view mrna profiles do not always correlate with protein expression as reported in many recent mass spectrometry studies 1 2 3 therefore protein microarrays were developed as a highthroughput tool to overcome the limitations of dna microarrays and to provide a versatile platform for protein functional analyses 4 5 6at the beginning of the development of protein array technology bacterial strains of a cdna expression library were gridded and grown on nylon membranes followed by lysis of the bacteria and immobilization of the total protein complement 7 8 however these early attempts only had limited success because i heterologous proteins eg human proteins were expressed in bacteria yielding proteins that lacked critical eukaryotic ptms ii denaturing conditions were used to lyse the bacterial host resulting in improperly folded proteins iii proteins of interest were not purified away from thousands of unwanted bacterial proteins and iv the density of the array was low before long other research groups began to report their efforts to fabricate highdensity protein microarrays with purified proteins or antibodies 9 10 11 12 in order to improve protein stability and preserve the native conformation of purified proteins many research groups developed a variety of surface features to keep proteins hydrated during protein microarray fabrication these efforts included reports on the 3d gelpad chips 13 nanowell chips 11 and plasma membranecoated chips 14 to name a fewthe real breakthrough was a 2001 report on the fabrication of a yeast proteome microarray by the snyder group 15 in this study approximately 5800 fulllength yeast orfs were individually expressed in yeast and their protein products purified as nterminal glutathione stransferase gst fusion proteins then each purified protein was robotically spotted on a single glass slide in duplicate at high ensity to form the first proteome microarray as it covered more than 75 of the yeast proteome more recently proteome microarrays have been fabricated from the proteomes of viruses bacteria plants and humans 4 16 17 18 19 20 21on the basis of their applications protein microarrays can be divided into two classes analytical and functional protein microarrays 22 unlike antibody arrays analytical microarrays functional protein microarrays are made by spotting purified proteins on solid surfaces and are therefore useful for direct characterization of protein functions such as proteinbinding properties ptms enzymesubstrate relationships and immune responses 5 22 more recently a reversephase array was developed in which tissue or cell lysates as opposed to antibodies are used to construct the array 23meanwhile we and others have developed various types of biochemical assays that can be conducted using protein microarrays to characterize proteinbinding properties including proteinprotein proteindna proteinrna and proteinlipid interactions and to identify substrates of various types of enzymes such as protein kinases acetyltransferases and ubiquitin and sumo e3 ligases via covalent reactions 9 15 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 table 1 these efforts clearly demonstrate the versatility and power of protein microarray technology as a systems biology and proteomics tool 6 32 in this review we will summarize recent applications of protein microarrays in clinical proteomics including biomarker identification pathogenhost interactions and cancer biology table 2in 2003 zhu et al fabricated the first viral proteome microarray composed of every fulllength protein and protein fragment encoded by sars coronavirus sarscov as well as proteins from five additional mammalian coronaviruses 16 these microarrays were then used to screen 400 canadian serum samples collected during the 2002 sars outbreak including samples from confirmed sarscov cases respiratory illness patients and healthcare professionals antibody response was quantified by the application of both antihuman igg and igm antibodies each coupled to different fluorophores followed by measurement of fluorescence signal intensity fig 2 to identify potential biomarkers serum samples were first clustered according to the relative signal intensities of all of the coronavirus proteins in an unsupervised fashion see data analysis section the serum samples fell into two major groups which upon subsequent comparison with clinical data were largely correlated with either sarspositive or sarsnegative sera in the cluster of markers five fragments of the sars n protein associated tightly with sars infection while sars sera also exhibited statistically significant binding to one spike protein fragment however a few proteins encoded by other coronaviruses also showed significant correlation to determine the best classifiers and classification model two different supervised analysis approaches k nearest neighbor and logistics regression were applied and the n protein of sarscov as well as the spike protein s from both sarscov and hcov229e were identified as the best classifiers a useful feature of a serum test relative to a nucleic acid diagnostic test is that antipathogen antibodies can potentially be detected long after infection taking advantage of this serum samples collected from sars patients who recovered from respiratory disease 320 days after diagnosis were used to probe the microarray and positive signals were detected with both antihuman igg and igm antibodies fig 2 middle panel these results clearly showed that sarscov n proteins could be readily recognized by human igg antibodies and importantly not by igm antibodies as expected however serum samples collected from the chinese patients immediately after fever was detected showed much stronger signals both in the igg and igm profiling fig 2 left panel these results indicated that the protein microarray approach is capable of detecting antipathogen antibodies in serum samples long after infection as well as detecting infection at early stages of infection as demonstrated by antihuman igm profiling the approach developed here is potentially applicable to all viruses and expected to have a great impact on epidemiological studies and possibly in clinical diagnosesa similar approach has been applied to profile humoral immune responses to two human herpesviruses epsteinbarr virus ebv and kaposis sarcomaassociated herpesvirus kshv ebv is an ubiquitous human herpesvirus while kshv has a restricted seroprevalence both viruses are associated with malignancies and show an increased frequency in individuals who are coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv1 the zhu and hayward groups generated a protein microarray consisting of 174 ebv and kshv fulllength proteins that were individually expressed and purified from yeast 36 41 instead of sera plasma antibody responses to ebv and kshv were examined from healthy volunteers and patients with bcell lymphoma or with aidsrelated kaposis sarcoma or lymphoma these experiments detected igg responses to known antigens as well as the tegument proteins orf38 kshv bbrf ebv bglf2 ebv and bnrf1 ebv and to the ebv early lytic proteins brrf1 and borf2 because iga responses to ebv ebna1 and viral capsid antigens have long been used as a diagnostic tool for nasopharyngeal carcinoma they also found iga responses in healthy and hivinfected patients iga responses to vca and to ebna1 were found to be frequently elevated in lymphoma patients and in individuals who were hiv1 positive comparison between the igg and iga responses indicated that iga responses were much higher against bcrf1 brrf2 and lmp2a therefore this study demonstrated that plasma can be used for biomarker identification immunoglobulin responses of other isotypes such as iga are therefore also worth testingto demonstrate that protein microarrays could also be used to identify new biomarkers in autoimmune diseases chen et al decided to apply an e coli k12 proteome microarray 17 to profile serum samples collected from crohns disease cd and ulcerative colitis uc patients 46 cd and uc are chronic idiopathic and clinically heterogeneous intestinal disorders collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease ibd although ibds have been suggested to be autoimmune diseases antimicrobial antibodies are present in the sera of ibd patients and some of these antigens have proven to be valuable serological biomarkers for diagnosis andor prognosis of the disease in this study a protein microarray including 4256 proteins encoded by a commensal k12 strain was screened using individual serum from healthy controls n  39 and clinically wellcharacterized patients with ibd 66 cd and 29 uc surprisingly among the 417 e coli proteins that were differentially recognized by serum antibodies from healthy controls and either cd or uc patients 169 proteins were identified as highly immunogenic in healthy controls 186 proteins were identified as highly immunogenic in cd patients and only 19 proteins were identified as highly immunogenic in uc patients using several statistical tools they identified two sets of serum antibodies as novel biomarkers for specifically distinguishing cd from healthy controls accuracy 86  4 p  001 and cd from uc accuracy 80  2 p  001 this study was the first demonstration of using highdensity highcontent proteome microarrays to discover novel serological biomarkers it was also the first effort to examine human immune responses to the entire proteome of a microbial species in a disease contexta protein microarray composed of individually purified human proteins would be an ideal tool for discovery of novel autoantigens associated with an autoimmune disease take autoimmune hepatitis aih as an example aih is a chronic necroinflammatory disease of human liver with little known etiology detection of nonorganspecific and liverrelated autoantibodies using immunoserological approaches has been widely used for diagnosis and prognosis however these traditional autoantigens such as antisma smooth muscle autoantibodies and antiana antinuclear autoantibodies are often mixtures of complex biological materials unambiguous and accurate detection of the disease demands identification and characterization of these autoantigens therefore song et al fabricated a human protein microarray of 5011 nonredundant proteins that were expressed and purified as gst fusions in yeast 45 there are several advantages associated with producing human proteins in yeast rather than bacteria i higher solubility ii higher yields of large proteins eg  50 kd iii better preserved conformation of proteins and iv proteins are less immunogenic when produced in yeast than in e coli
17 21 25 however unlike a viral or bacterial protein microarray a significant obstacle to the use of a human protein microarray of high content is its high cost for example a human protein array of 9000 proteins can exceed 1000 per array in order to reduce this cost song et al developed a twophase strategy to identify new biomarkers in aih phase i is designed for rapid selection of candidate biomarkers which are then validated in phase ii fig 3 in phase i 30 aih and 30 control serum samples were selected and individually used to probe the human protein microarrays at a 1000fold dilution followed by detection of bound human autoantibodies using a cy5conjugated antihuman igg antibody statistical analysis revealed 11 candidate autoantigens to validate these candidates and to avoid a potential overfitting problem see below which is especially likely when dealing with a small sample size the 11 proteins and three positive controls were repurified to build a large number of lowcost small arrays for phase ii validation these arrays were then sequentially probed with serum samples used in phase i and serum samples obtained from an additional 22 aih 50 primary biliary cirrhosis 43 hepatitis b 41 hepatitis c 11 system lupus erythematosus 11 primary sjgrens syndrome and two rheumatoid arthritis patients as negative controls they also included 26 serum samples from patients suffering from other types of severe disease and 50 samples from healthy subjects three new antigens rps20 alb2like and dutpase were identified as highly aihspecific biomarkers with sensitivities of 475 rps20 455 albalike and 227 dutpase which were further validated with additional aih samples in a doubleblind design finally they demonstrated that these new biomarkers could be readily applied to elisabased assays for clinical diagnosis and prognosisthis study represents a new paradigm in biomarker identification using protein microarrays for three reasons first a manageable number of candidate biomarkers can be rapidly identified at low cost because fewer expensive protein microarrays of high content are needed in the first phase of this twophase strategy second by using small arrays comprised selected candidate proteins the validation step can be rapidly carried out with a much larger cohort at lower cost this validation step is extremely important for avoiding the overfitting problem associated with statistical analysis in biomarker or classifier identification especially when dealing with a small cohort eg 40 overfitting is a problem in which a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship it generally occurs in biomarker identification when the system is excessively complex such as having too many individualtoindividual variations relative to the number of samples used as a result biomarkers that have been overfit generally have poor predictive performance therefore testing an additional larger cohort in a doubleblind design is an effective way to rule out overfit biomarkers third the author developed elisabased assays to examine the performance of the validated biomarkers with additional samples these newly identified biomarkers serve as a translational step toward clinical practicein addition there have been a series of studies that employed pathogen protein microarrays to profile serological responses following infection for example protein microarrays have been developed in bacteria and viruses for biomarker identification in various infectious diseases 43 44 47 54 these studies have clearly demonstrated the power of protein microarrays in identification of potential biomarkers however several shortcomings are repeatedly seen in these studies for instance many of these arrays were fabricated using proteins translated in e coli lysates without purification 43 44 47 54 because these proteins are contaminated with unwanted e coli proteins sensitivity of the assay is likely reduced due to their high immunogenicity 41 as a result e coli lysates had to be used as a blocking reagent to alleviate this problem also problematic is that in many of these studies identified biomarkers were not validated with additional cohorts and therefore the possibility of overfitting was not completely ruled outin 2007 zhu et al described the first study using a yeast proteome microarray to identify host factors that can affect replication of brome mosaic virus bmv a plantinfecting rna virus that can also replicate in saccharomyces cerevisiae
25 previous studies have shown that this positivestranded rna virus encodes a trnalike structure at the 3end of its rna genome in which a clamped adenine motif cam is required for packaging its genome into the capsid to identify crucial host proteins that can interfere with the viral packaging process a cy3labeled camcontaining rna stemloop structure was incubated on the yeast proteome microarray in the presence of an equal amount of a cy5labeled mutated cam hairpin using cy3tocy5 fluorescence signal intensity ratios the top hits were identified and validated using an in vitro gelshift assay two validated candidate proteins pseudouridine synthase 4 and actin patch protein 1 were selected for further characterization in tobacco plants both proteins modestly reduced bmv genomic plusstrand rna accumulation but dramatically inhibited bmv systemic spread in plants pseudouridine synthase 4 also prevented the encapsidation of the bmv rnas in plants and the reassembly of bmv virions in vitrothis work is significant because it established the first rnabinding assay on a proteome microarray and demonstrated the utility of protein microarrays for identifying important players involved in pathogenhost interactionsin the course of evolution viruses have been very successful at exploiting the host via development of their own arsenals some of which were hijacked from the host in the form of both dna and proteins to develop more effective antivirals one must understand the molecular mechanisms by which viruses exploit the host machineries for their own use the human   and  herpesviruses infect different tissues and cause distinct diseases ranging from mild cold sores to pneumonitis birth defects and cancers 55 however they each confront many of the same challenges in infecting their hosts including reprogramming cellular gene expression sensing cellcycle phase and modifying cellcycle progression and reactivating the lytic life cycle to produce new virions and spread infection on the other hand many lytic cycle genes involved in replication of the viral genomes eg the orthologous serinethreonine protein kinases are highly conserved across the herpesvirus family therefore it became an attractive hypothesis that the shared substrates targeted by these orthologous viral kinases would reveal host pathways that are critical for replication across the herpesvirus familyto test the above hypothesis li et al employed a human protein microarray 56 the authors purified four orthologous kinases encoded by ebv kshv human cytomegalovirus hcmv and hsv1 performed kinase reactions on a human protein microarray described previously 4 and identified 110 shared substrates like every largescale screen the next challenge was to select candidates that would be worth pursuing to do so the authors then applied gene ontology and string analyses httpstring-dborg a database of known and predicted proteinprotein interactions to these candidates and found a highly connected cluster of 15 proteins strikingly these proteins were all known to be involved in the dna damage response ddr fig 4 the host ddr has been known to be important to many viruses including human herpesviruses and is relevant to virusinduced tumorigenesis 35 to narrow down this list to a single candidate for indepth characterization the authors reasoned that the viruses are likely to target an upstream master regulator which triggers the dna damage response on the basis of a literature search and the structure of this cluster tatinteractive protein 60 tip60 emerged as an excellent candidate for followup because i tip60 is further upstream in the ddr pathway than any of the other candidates in the cluster ii it serves as a master regulator in ddr via activation of atm autophosphorylation activity by acetylation iii it regulates chromatin dynamics via histone acetylation and iv its importance has been shown in other viruses indeed the authors observed that when tip60 was knocked down in ebvinfected b cells ebvs lytic replication was greatly reduced next the authors applied a series of cellbased assays and showed that during ebv replication tip60 activation by the bglf4 kinase triggers ebvinduced ddr and also mediates induction of viral lytic gene expression finally the authors demonstrated that tip60 was also required for efficient lytic replication in hcmv kshv and hsv1this work illustrates the value of highthroughput unbiased approaches for the discovery of conserved viral targets in the host that have the potential to be developed into novel therapeutic targets for antivirals currently there are few drugs available to treat herpesvirus infections and viral escape mutants develop as a result of extensive use of this limited repertoire the herpesvirus protein kinases are attractive antiviral drug targets however developing broadly effective drugs targeting protein kinases requires knowledge of their common cellular substrates the information provided by common substrate identification will assist in the design of assays for new and broadly effective antiherpesvirus therapeuticsprotein microarrays can also serve as a convenient tool for profiling proteinprotein interactomes between a pathogen and a host in a recent example hayward et al surveyed the interactome between a kshvencoded virulent factor lana and the human host using human protein microarrays in order to identify host proteins that can be recognized by lana 57 lana functions in latently infected cells as an essential participant in kshv genome replication and as a driver of dysregulated cell growth although yeast twohybrid screens gst affinity immunoprecipitation assays and chromatography coupled with ms have been applied to the identification of lana binding proteins each approach has its strengths and weaknesses and each tend to identify different sets of proteins in this study the authors used purified flagtagged lana applied to human protein microarrays to identify 61 potential binding partners many of which were previously unknown eight out of nine proteins were validated by coimmunoprecipitation including tip60 protein phosphatase 2a replication protein a rpa and xpa although human papillomavirus e6 hiv1 tat and hcmv pul27 interact with tip60 and induce tip60 degradation lanaassociated 42 retained acetyltransferase activity and showed increased stability this observation is in line with the study described in the previous section that showed that tip60 plays a positive role in kshv lytic replication on the other hand identification of rpa as a lana interacting partner suggested that lana may play a role in regulating the length of host telomeres because rpa1 and rpa2 are known to be essential in the replication of cellular telomeric dna to test this hypothesis the authors performed chip assays with antirpa1 and rpa2 antibodies using primers specific to the telomere regions and found that the presence of lana drastically reduced the recruitment of both rpa1 and rpa2 to the host telomeres while it had no impact on the protein level of the rpa complex this observation raised the possibility that lana might have an impact on telomere length using southern blot analysis of terminal restriction fragments the standard method for quantifying telomere length the authors demonstrated that the average length of telomeres was shortened by at least 50 in both lanaexpressing endothelial cells and kshvinfected primary effusion lymphoma cells many interesting questions remain to be answered how does lana block the rpa complex recruitment to the telomeres is it achieved via direct competition since lana is also an ssdnabinding protein or does lana serve as a kinase sink for the rpa complex and regulate rpa recruitment via phosphorylationon the flip side a human factor of interest can be used to survey a virus protein microarray to identify important viral factors similar to the ubiquitylation pathway sumoylation involves a series of sequential enzymatic reactions that conjugate sumo to lysine residues on substrate proteins previous studies have shown that both latent and lytic ebv proteins interact with the sumo system noncovalent sumoebv protein interactions can occur via a sumo interaction motif sim in the target proteins to comprehensively identify additional ebv proteins that bind to sumo li et al performed a proteinbinding assay with human sumo2 58 on a previously described ebv proteome microarray 41 and identified a total of 11 proteins including the conserved viral kinase bglf4 the mutation of potential sims in bglf4 at both n and ctermini changed the intracellular localization of bglf4 from nuclear to cytoplasmic while bglf4 mutated in the nterminal sim remained predominantly nuclear the mutation of the cterminal sim yielded an intermediate phenotype with nuclear and cytoplasmic staining the authors also found that bglf4 abolished the sumoylation of the ebv lytic cycle transactivator zta and that this inhibitory effect on zta sumoylation was dependent on both bglf4 sumo binding and bglf4 kinase activity the global profile of protein sumoylation was also suppressed by bglf4 but not by the sim or kinasedead bglf4 mutant furthermore bglfs interaction with sumo was required to induce the cellular dna damage response and to enhance the production of extracellular virus during ebv lytic replicationthe identification of pathogen proteins that interact with human factors has also been applied to understanding the mechanisms of bacterial infection margarit et al harnessed the power of protein microarrays to identify proteins expressed by two species of the streptococcus grampositive bacteria streptococcus pyogenes and s agalactiae that interact with human factors known to mediate pathogenesis 59 rather than developing wholeproteome arrays they used a bioinformatics approach to predict those proteins present on the cellular surfaceand thus most likely to play a role in infection and used this list of 200 proteins to develop their arrays they also carefully considered the human probes that they would use choosing three human ligands fibronectin fibrinogen and c4binding protein all known to play important roles in the colonization and infection processes binding experiments conducted using the streptococcal arrays and human protein probes identified 17 of the 20 known interactions previously reported as well as eight newly identified streptococcal proteins many of which they confirmed by far western blot analysis these novel proteins included proteins of unknown function as well as three related proteins that they termed the fib proteins they then used domain mapping to identify regions of the fib proteins required for their interaction with the human ligands interestingly sera samples from patients with s agalactiae infections show high titers of fibspecific antibodies indicating that these proteins are highly expressed during infection further work will determine the role of these proteins in infection and whether they will emerge as suitable drug targets to fight pathogenic streptococcus infectionsin summary the above studies have demonstrated the power of protein microarrays in the discovery of novel molecular mechanisms underlying hostpathogen interactions at various levels in recent years other highthroughput approaches such as shotgun ms 60 genomewide rnai screens 61 62 and yeast twohybrid 63 64 have been applied to understand hostpathogen interactions however the protein microarray approach provides a more versatile platform than any of these single approaches for identifying multiple types of direct interactions between a pathogen and host including proteinprotein interactions 57 58 59 rnaprotein interactions 25 and enzymesubstrate interactions 35a widely adopted approach to determining the status of signaling pathways in tumor cells is based on immunoblot analysis with antibodies that can recognize phosphorylated proteins to transform the lowthroughput immunoblot to a highthroughput format haab et al first reported the development of antibody microarray technology in which individual commercial antibodies were spotted on glass at high density 12 this technology allows for simultaneous detection of multiple antigens presented in a complex biological sample such as cells tissues and body fluids 67 68the term reverse phase protein microarray was proposed by liotta petricoin et al in 2001 69 as an array in which lysates of cells or tissues are immobilized on the array surface rather than antibodies using phosphoproteinspecific antibodies these arrays can then be used to interrogate the phosphorylation state of proteins present in these mixtures as a proxy of signaling status in tumors there are several ongoing clinical trials currently utilizing the reverse phase protein microarray 70 an obvious advantage of this approach is that it allows to evaluate the state of multiple components of a signaling pathway even though the cell is lysed because fabrication of such microarrays requires a minimum amount of sample multiple clinical samples such as biopsy samples tumors and body fluids can be printed on a series of identical arrays and analyzed in parallel using commercially available antiphosphoprotein or other specific antibodiesfor example petricoin et al used cancer cell lysates representing 59 patient samples obtained from the childrens oncology group intergroup rhabdomyosarcoma study irs to fabricate reverse phase microarrays 53 rhabodymyosarcoma is a rare childhood cancer that arises from undifferentiated muscle progenitor cells although current treatments can yield as high as a 67 diseasefree survival rate the reasons for treatment failure in the remaining onethird of patients are unknown the identification of biomarkers to allow distinguishing these patients from those that respond to traditional therapies would help identify those patients best suited for alternative therapies and also potential drug targets these reverse phase arrays were therefore used as platforms to detect the phosphorylation status of proteins thought to underlie whether rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes were responsive to standard chemotherapy regimens using phosphositespecific antibodies the authors identified higher phosphorylation levels in four aktmtor pathway components in patients with poor survival outcomes network analysis based on this data and known pathway information was used to find that on the other hand patients with good treatment outcomes showed mtor pathway suppression together these findings suggested that pharmacologically inducing mtor pathway suppression could result in improved outcomes for patients that failed to respond to standard chemotherapy regimens the authors proceeded to test this hypothesis using a mouse xenograft model with rhabdoymyosarcoma cell lines and a known mtor pathway inhibitor they found that treatment with the inhibitor resulted in reduced phosphorylation of the protein 4ebp1 that had been identified by the protein microarray studies as well as inhibition of tumor growth these results suggest that mtor pathway inhibitors may be a potential way to improve treatment outcomes for patients that fail to respond to standard chemotherapy regimens additionally they demonstrate the power of tumor cell lysate arrays in i identifying specific patient subpopulations that could benefit from tailored therapies as well as ii identifying the specific molecules that should be targeted in developing and testing these therapies however there are several major problems with the reverse phase array approach first wellcharacterized antibodies are not available for the great majority of human proteins 71 72 second several recent studies have suggested that many commercially available monoclonal antibodies mabs may not even recognize their purported targets and crossreact extensively with other cellular antigens 73 third antibody crossreactivity is an even more pressing problem in diagnostic and therapeutic applications as underlined by the recent withdrawal of several mabbased pharmaceuticals from the market 74 75 finally this approach requires prior knowledge as to which phosphoproteins should be evaluated and as a result is not an ideal platform for the discovery of novel biomarkerscurrent screening for breast cancer using mammograms detects only 70 of breast cancers and falsepositive mammograms lead to unnecessary biopsies the identification of biomarkers that would allow early detection of breast cancer could provide a noninvasive low cost method that could improve patient outcomes one promising category of cancer biomarkers is autoantibodies to tumor antigens that offer better stability specificity ease of purification and ease of detection compared to other serum proteins in order to identify autoantibodies to tumor antigens associated with breast cancer anderson et al used protein arrays containing candidate tumor antigens and applied breast cancer patient and control serum samples to identify differences in the human antibody repertoire that could be used as biomarkers 50 these custom protein arrays termed nappa arrays nucleic acid protein programmable array are fabricated by the spotting of cdnas that encode the target proteins at each feature of the array proteins are transcribed and translated by a cellfree system and immobilized by encoded epitope tags thus bypassing the protein purification process additionally the authors used a threephase screening approach to home in on the best candidate breast cancer biomarkers in the first phase they used arrays with the full set of 4988 tumor antigens in order to eliminate uninformative autoantibodies that were present at similar levels in both early breast cancer patients and healthy women subtracting these antigens the protein set was reduced to 761 allowing them to fabricate smaller arrays for the next phase that offer the benefits of reduced cost and fewer false positives in the second phase sera from patients with invasive early breast cancer and benign breast disease were compared in order to identify antigens specific to early breast cancer but absent from benign breast disease resulting in 119 antigens in the third phase they set out to validate this antigen list finding 28 antigens that maintained high levels of specificity in a blinded validation assay including the protein atp6ap1 a known autoantigen they then focused on this protein and went on to show high expression of atp6ap1 in four breast cancer cell lines by western blot as well as significantly higher atp6ap1 autoantibody levels in approximately 13 of early breast cancer serum cases compared to controls although only a first step this work demonstrates the power of protein microarrays in particular programmable protein microarrays in identifying biomarkers for the early detection of breast canceran important goal of identifying cancer biomarkers is to define new strategies for early diagnosis that can allow early intervention with current therapies to improve patient survival rates additionally since cancerassociated autoantibodies often target proteins that are mutated modified or aberrantly expressed in tumor cells they could also be considered immunologic reporters that could uncover molecular events underlying tumorigenesis 52 the molecular players in these events in turn may be the best place to start in efforts to develop novel therapies in order to identify autoantibody biomarkers that could act as indicators of bladder cancer as well as the underlying molecular pathology contributing to disease orenespinero turned to a protein array strategy using the invitrogen protoarray containing approximately 8000 purified human proteins to identify antibodies to tumorassociated antigens in serum 52 comparing serum samples collected from 12 patients with bladder cancer and ten control patients without bladder cancer they identified 171 differentially expressed proteins among these they selected clusterin and dynamin for validation based in part on their known role in cancer biology using immunohistochemistry on a custom tissue microarray comprised bladder cancer tumor samples they found reduced expression levels of clusterin in muscle invasive bladder tumors as compared to nonmuscle invasive tumors on the other hand they found that lowprotein expression of dynamin was associated with increased tumor stage and grade higher recurrence rate after surgery as well as shorter survival paradoxically their followup tests revealed lower expression levels of dynamin and clusterin associated with disease in contrast to their protein array results that showed increased autoantibody levels to these proteins among bladder cancer patients compared to controls despite these contradictory findings the authors demonstrated significant associations between dynamin and clusterin expression levels and bladder cancer disease progression that could potentially allow them to use these as informative biomarkers in the clinic as well as potential drug targets this work demonstrates the power of protein microarrays for the identification of autoantibodies to tumorassociated antigens and its application to the discovery of cancer biomarkerscell surfaces especially mammalian cell surfaces are heavily coated with complex poly and oligosaccharides and these glycans have been implicated in many functions such as celltocell communication hostpathogen interactions and cell matrix interactions aberrations of glycosylation are usually indicative of the onset of specific diseases such as cancer there are a handful of tools that can be used to study glycosylation such as lc 76 77 mc 78 ce 79 80 and flow cytometry 81 82to take advantage of the specific glycanbinding properties of lectins and the parallel analysis capability of microarrays 83 we and others have developed the lectin microarray technology for profiling glycans in a highthroughput fashion 51 84 85 86 87 although lectin microarrays in early reports were only composed of a small number of lectins in a later report a highcontent lectin microarray composed of 94 unique commercial lectins was fabricated and used to profile accessible surface glycans of mammalian cells 51 a total of 24 human cell lines were labeled and applied to this lectin microarray a binary algorithm was developed to generate a glycan signature for each cell line resulting in a hierarchical cluster based on their accessible glycan composition by comparing the glycan profiles of a breast cancer cell line and its cancer stemlike cell derivatives three lectins namely lel aal and wga were found to specifically recognize mcf7 cells but not the derivatives to confirm this result the authors first employed lelconjugated beads to purify away the normal mcf7 cells from the cancer stemlike cells estimated as 01 in the cell population in an mcf7 cell population as a means to enrich cancer stemlike cells next using a mouse model to test the enrichment of the cancer stemlike cells they showed that 2 weeks following injection of the leldepleted cancer stemlike cell enriched cultures average tumor size was greater than twofold bigger than the control group injected with a similar number of regular mcf7 cells this study demonstrated the utility of a lectin microarray in the identification of novel cell surface markers on cancer stemlike cells that subsequently allowed enrichment for cancer stemlike cellsbecause the affinity of lectins is usually low kd is in the range of 103106
m 84 in processing a cellbinding assay on a lectin microarray an analyte of low affinity may be washed away from the immobilized lectins especially when dealing with live cells in order to overcome these problems researchers have modified lectin microarray technology in many ways 88 one example is antibodyassisted lectin profiling that was developed for detecting glycoproteins at low concentrations kuno et al used this method to analyze the glycan structures of a protein hpod which has been proposed to enhance the metastatic potential of glioblastoma cells 86 the hpod protein complex was first ip enriched with the appropriate antibody and then incubated on a lectin array to identify its associated glycans an additional modification of the lectin microarray platform is the use of the evanescentfield activated fluorescence detection system which allows for labelfree realtime detection since the evanescent field is generated within 200 nm the background signals are so low that washing steps are not necessary it has been reported that this detection system has by far the highest sensitivity among the lectin microarray detection systems with a reported detection limit in the 100 pm range 89 finally li et al reported a twophase discovery and validation approach to improve the sensitivity of the lectin microarray technology in cancer biomarker discovery for prostate cancer 90 first pooled tissue samples for each group were generated by mixing equal amounts of tissue proteins 50 g from the four cases in the normal nonaggressive cancer aggressive cancer and metastasis groups in the first phase or discovery phase prostatespecific antigen psa and membrane metalloendopeptidase mme proteins were extracted from each tissue group using antitotal psa antibody and antimme mabs respectively after incubating the iped psa or mme proteins on a lectin microarray captured psa or mme proteins were detected with antipsa or antimme mabs comparison of signals between each group of pooled tissue revealed that the fraction of psa that is oglycosylated as recognized by jacalin or neu5ac conjugated as detected by sna as well as the fraction of mme that was modified by either galnac or glcnac was highly elevated in aggressive prostate cancer and metastatic prostate cancer groups these results were confirmed with immunosorbent assay in phase ii in which psa and mme were first captured on an ecl plate coated with antipsa and antimme mabs followed by detection with biotinylated lectins these studies demonstrate the power and adaptability of protein microarrays for detection of even lowaffinity interactions such as those between lectins and glycansrecent years have witnessed tremendous growth in the use of protein microarrays to address important questions in the field of clinical proteomics in the area of biomarker identification most of the recent research has been focused on either infections or autoimmune diseases we believe that protein microarrays especially functional protein microarrays will be widely used for identification of cancer biomarkers in the near future indeed recent advances in immunoproteomics and highthroughput technologies have suggested that the autoantibody repertoire in cancer patients might be quite different as compared with that in healthy subjects leading to the hypothesis that autoantigens might be identified as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis as well as cancer prognosis 91 ideally a human protein microarray developed for such a purpose should cover the entire human proteome in order to enable a comprehensive screen for the autoantigens to our knowledge we have fabricated a human proteome microarray of the best coverage 70 21 however when hundreds if not thousands of serum samples are needed to screen for biomarkers the cost of using these human proteome microarrays accumulates very rapidly an effective strategy to overcome this obstacle is to apply the twophase strategy as described in the aih study 45 we expect that this strategy will become popular in the near future finally we expect that functional protein microarrays will be used as a readout to obtain reaction profiles of the collected activities of various types of enzymes such as kinases acetyltransferases ubiquitin and sumo e3 ligases in cancerous tissues comparing ptm profiles obtained from cancer and healthy tissues will allow us to identify biomarkers and to gain new insights into the molecular mechanisms of diseaseeven with the advancement of infectious disease surveillance over the last century communicable diseases still pose significant risks to public health on the world health organisations who top 10 threats to global health in 2019 four on the list directly refer to infectious diseases pandemic influenza hiv dengue and another for high-threat pathogens such as ebola world health organisation 2019 emerging infectious diseases caused by novel pathogenic organisms are of notable concern it was highlighted by who that since the 1970s over 1500 new pathogens were discovered and nearly 40 new infectious diseases have been identified world health organisation 2018a many of these have severely impacted communities with several major outbreaks occurring within the last 20 years including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 20022003 ebola 20142016 h1n1flu swine flu 20092010 zika virus 20152016 and covid-19 20192020 world health organisation 2020a two others on this list are regarding the prevention and treatment of infectious disease one being hesitation to vaccinate and the other the rise in antimicrobial resistance amr both have been linked to the re-emergence of communicable diseasesthere are a number of drivers affecting the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases woolhouse and gowtage-sequeria 2005 these range from climate change poverty and unprecedented population increases with uncontrolled urbanisation another driver is globalisation linked with tourism and trade resulting in a strong network of air links with regards to international flights it has been highlighted that the incubation period of any human disease is still longer than the lengthiest aviation time for any international flight frenk and gmez-dants 2002 outbreaks are therefore not confined to one geographic location but are less than 24 h away from being a threat somewhere elseanother key factor for the re-emergence of infectious diseases has been linked with drug resistant pathogens whilst microbial evolution happens naturally inappropriate usage of antimicrobials puts additional selective pressures and further facilitates rates of resistance allen et al 2010 andersson and hughes 2014 whilst antibiotics tends to be focused on in discussions of amr rising cases of both fungal and viral resistances still pose significant threats fisher et al 2018 for example candida auris an emerging multidrug resistant yeast is a cause of major hospital acquired infection with high associated mortality having only first been identified in 2009 it has resistance to all clinically available antifungals lockhart et al 2017the rising rate of resistance has resulted in amr being hailed as one of the biggest public health risks threatening medicine in the 21st century oneill 2014 increasing concerns of amr have led to the establishment of the global antimicrobial resistance surveillance system glass in 2015 by who with the aims of sharing information on a global scale to strengthen data and aid decision making on national and international actions world health organisation 2015 whilst the recent report 20172018 has revealed detailed results with participation from over 60 countries several limitations in the study were discussed world health organisation 2018b it was recognised that there was a lack of sampling strategy leading to selection bias also patient samples are typically taken from those that have sought out medical care and hence might not be representative for a population it was further highlighted the need to move away from laboratory data to include epidemiological and population datathere are several techniques with a range of advantages and disadvantages currently used for infectious disease surveillance table 1
 disease monitoring which is often disease specific can vary significantly with country and will depend upon the resources and sophistication of the public health services and facilities available thacker et al 2006 the information collected can be provided to who who have the authority to lead the global surveillance of infectious diseases who have had an integral role in infectious disease surveillance as well as leading international surveillance networks eg influenza surveillance they also provide international coordination of epidemic responses in diseases that pose significant public health risks examples of conventional routes to monitoring diseases are based upon existing resources such as mortality and morbidity rates prescription and hospital admission data whilst these are valuable source of information for surveillance purposes they do suffer from bias resource insensitivity and costs bauer 2008
table 1 routes to assessing public health and infectious disease surveillance techniques with advantages and disadvantagesmany of the current systems in place are forms of passive surveillance that have disadvantages for example in countries with less developed health services morbidity might be higher than assumed due to people failing to report to a healthcare service due to lack of access this combined with the fact that sometimes in epidemics the laboratory facilities can become easily overwhelmed  the consequence of such is that these cases are not reported the 2009 swine flu epidemic caused by a h1n1 influenza virus spread rapidly to214 countries in the space of a few months whilst it was estimated that several million people were infected with over 18400 confirmed laboratory deaths worldwide reported by august 2010 world health organisation 2010 it is believed that this is a gross underestimation reported studies in the literature have estimated through modelling techniques that there could have been as many as 1015 times this amount with up to 203000 respiratory deaths dawood et al 2012 simonsen et al 2013 dawood et al projected around 80 of these deaths occurring in southeast asia and africa the causes for underestimation have been attributed to poor reporting due to the overwhelming number of casesthe problems underlying infectious disease surveillance will only be exacerbated current predictions have estimated a global population growth of 26 from 77 billion 2019 to 97 billion in 2050 with 68 of the global population expected to be urban united nations department of economic and social affairs 2019 with the current unprecedented rises in population size there will undoubtedly be further challenges but also opportunities in rapid health surveillance and responsetherefore there is a need for a surveillance technique that i provides comprehensive and objective data ii gives results in real-time iii is flexible iv able to monitor multiple diseases even those that are rare v is scalable and cost effective vi could be applied in low resource settings furthermore the surveillance system needs to have comprehensive data collection systems regarding emergence of new diseases and re-emergence of old diseases the threat of imported diseases or pathogens and the emergence of multidrug or pan-drug resistant organisms it has also been highlighted in the literature that monitoring clinics and laboratories for informing on public health is not sufficient and there should also be an aspect of environmental monitoring of potential hazards nsubuga et al 2006 therefore a surveillance technique that could also encompass environmental exposure would be invaluable in providing comprehensive exposure status and disease outcomes a new surveillance technique utilising water fingerprinting is under the development to provide objective and comprehensive evaluation of both public and environmental health status in real-time
complexity of wastewater matrix whilst conceptually wbe is very simple and clearly offers attractive advantages for the monitoring of public health there are some challenges to be considered for example not only are the levels of biomarkers far more dilute in wastewater especially in comparison to urine but the wastewater matrix itself provides a complex environment to work in daughton 2012 as previously mentioned wastewater contains a diverse abundance of chemical and biological targets which can give incredibly detailed information about the population that contributes however a drawback to having such a large amount of information is in the successful extraction from the matrix itself and the subsequent analysis of specific targets can be difficult extraction methods such as solid phase extraction and immunoassay techniques along with sophisticated analytical tools such as advanced mass spectrometry have allowed for the analysis of a wide number of compounds petrie et al 2014 recent developments in sensing approaches could enable measurements on site which would allow the system to provide information on public health in real time yang et al 2017 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2015
estimation of population size another challenge associated with wbe is the problem posed by dynamic populations eg population fluctuations due to tourism and commuters ort et al 2014 typically the standard approach is for levels of certain endogenous biomarkers in humans such as cortisol or cotinine to be calculated as daily loads which have been normalised to the population this enables inter-city comparison chen et al 2014 however there are difficulties in estimating the population size of individual wwtp catchments this can result in unaccounted for unique population fluctuations that whilst having negligible impact on the levels of biomarkers in large populations 100000 people they might contribute to higher uncertainties in smaller populationsthere are several techniques that can be employed to reduce to the source of uncertainties associated with population size investigating certain hydrochemical parameters which have well-established methods of analysis such as chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod or ammonium nh4
 can aid in estimating populations contributing to a wwtp catchment at a particular time period been et al 2014 van nuijs et al 2011 these however can be influenced by the composition of wastewater the other uncertainties associated with the technique briefly mentioned above with regards to sample collection and analytical variability amongst a couple of others have all been extensively discussed in a number of reviews castiglioni et al 2013 ort et al 2014 ort et al 2010 however score and the emdcca have demonstrated that with recognition of the limitations of the technique that the development and adoption of a reliable standardised method will give reliability and credibility to the studies and allow spatial and temporal comparisons to be madeuncertainties within population size will also pose problems for infectious disease surveillance within wastewater as the presence of tourists or commuters within a catchment area could make it challenging to monitor the actual emergence of an infection within that community for example it would be impossible to distinguish whether the presence of a pathogen in wastewater had stemmed from a visitors passing though or from within the community itself arguably however the presence of a pathogen in wastewater whether from a resident in the catchment area or not still provides critical information as members within the population may have been unknowingly exposed to the infected individual this could indicate towards potential disease emergence within the community allowing valuable time for appropriate preparation and response to be put into placeendogenous and exogenous biomarkers in wastewater when chosen carefully can give key information with regards to health of a population along with some of the limitations of wbe touched upon above there are also certain criteria that must be fulfilled for a biomarker to be considered in wbe techniques for example the biomarker in question must mostly be excreted via urine and concentrations of the biomarker must be in ng l-1 for downstream detection of the biomarker in wastewater chen et al 2014 another vital characteristic is that the biomarker needs to be stable not only in the sewage system but also during the process of sampling and storage mccall et al 2016 biomarkers also need to be unique to human metabolism and ideally the metabolism process involving the biomarker would be well understood this ensures that the biomarker in question has only originated from human sources as opposed to exogenous ones potential contamination of animals in the sewage system or from microbes present in wastewater daughton 2012 with regards to the sewage system wastewater is home to an extensive range of complex microbial communities that are challenging to characterise and will vary geographically as of such there is a high risk of microbial degradation or transformation of chemical compounds in fact biological treatment in wastewater treatment plants such as trickle bed filters are home to these diverse microbial communities which play a key role for the breakdown of many organic compounds kraigher et al 2008an example of a key biological marker are pathogenic dnarna residues from bacteria viruses and fungi the detection in influent wastewater would suggest human sources and hence indicate what diseases are circulating within a population whilst risk factors for emerging infectious diseases have highlighted resistant bacteria as a concern viruses pose a significant threat due to their high mutation rates and ability to adapt to new host eg humans this is particularly in the case of rna viruses where higher nucleotide substitution rates can result in this rapid adaption and spreading in new host populations woolhouse and gowtage-sequeria 2005 the potential of wastewater to be used for viral surveillance has been well discussed in the literature barras 2018 obrien and xagoraraki 2019 wigginton et al 2015 wastewater surveillance has already demonstrated promising results with the potential for retrospective prediction of disease outbreaks of hepatitis a and norovirus hellmr et al 2014 influenza in wastewater was also investigated during the h1n1 swine flu virus outbreak whilst influenza a viruses were detected in sewage the pandemic h1n1 virus was not detected heijnen and medema 2011 furthermore environmental surveillance of polio in wastewater has been utilised since the 1980 s years before when the term wastewater-based epidemiology was coined with finland hovi et al 2012 israel roberts 2013 and senegal ndiaye et al 2014 all successfully analysing sewage samples in order to assess polio circulating within populations who have also released guidelines for employing environmental sampling to monitor polio in wastewater samples world health organisation 2003the complexity of a wastewater matrix is not only challenging for the extraction and quantification of chemical compounds similar problems are apparent for biological biomarkers composition of wastewater contains a diverse range of pcr inhibitors including fats proteins and humic and fulvic acids which can cause problems later during downstream processing during pcr the availability of different commercial extraction kits for dnarna has demonstrated sometimes variable efficiencies and consistencies when extracting from pcr inhibitor rich samples including wastewater and sediments mumy and findlay 2004 walden et al 2017 this results in challenges when making meaningful comparisons across different studies and in establishing spatial and temporal trends however advancements of molecular biology techniques offer new routes for the analysis of genetic material including digital pcr dpcr and next generation sequencing techniques in dpcr the absolute quantification of target genes is calculated using poisson distribution statistics via the partitioning of dnarna samples into tens and thousands of reaction wells due to this partitioning effect pcr inhibitory substances have demonstrated to have less of an effect in environmental samples including wastewater when analysed via dpcr raki et al 2014 critical evaluation of dpcr and its suitability for certain sample types have been discussed by salipante et al salipante and jerome 2020next generation sequencing is another promising technology providing a wealth of information on the complex microbial communities in samples including identification of the diverse range of pathogens and resistance genes present in particular analysis of the viruses and resistance genes present via metagenomics has been highlighted as providing potentially key information on novel pathogens as well as re-emerging infectious diseases and amr aarestrup and woolhouse 2020 fernandez-cassi et al 2018 whilst standardisation of protocols of metagenomics remain a challenge the continued advancements in the technology combined with decreasing costs sequencing have the potential to revolutionise both pathogen and resistance surveillance in wastewaterprotein based inflammation biomarkers represent a vital group of endogenous markers urine proteomics has attracted much interest in the last decade as has been evidenced to contain an abundant source of proteins urine for diagnosis purposes is desirable not only due to the non-invasive nature of testing but because of the previously untapped source of potential disease and health biomarkers zhao et al 2017 some which could be sensitive to changes in the body and could be early indicators of disease whilst only a handful of proteins are currently utilised in clinics it has been previously highlighted that this is not a limitation for wbe as purposes here are not for diagnostic analysis daughton 2018 urinary inflammation biomarkers that are indicative of inflammation include c-reactive proteins crp and interleukins including il-6 and il-8 have been highlighted as promising candidates for use in wbe rice and kasprzyk-hordern 2019 urinary crp levels are routinely utilised in clinics and in human biomonitoring studies eg to investigate renal function abnormalities within a population stuveling et al 2003 other proteins that have previously been suggested for wbe include vitamin d binding proteins which are prognostic biomarkers for kidney disease due to their significantly elevated levels occurring in the urine of infected individuals daughton 2018increased interest into urine proteomics for non-invasive clinical tests is a growing area and with it will bring greater understanding of the proteins present in urine whilst it is widely considered that proteomics in wbe would offer invaluable new insight into public health of communities the analysis of proteins in wastewater however is still underexplored rice and kasprzyk-hordern 2019 the extraction and analysis of these larger biomolecules from wastewater poses new analytical challenges due to the complexity of the matrix and questions regarding stability of proteins in the sewage systems are yet to be investigatedbiomarkers of intervention encompass pharmaceuticals used to treat infectious diseases or ones used to lessen the symptoms as previously mentioned wbe has been successful at monitoring drug usage and as many infectious diseases are seasonal there are potentially interesting opportunities for trends to be established in wastewater regarding antibiotics a handful of studies have demonstrated seasonal patterns for several antibiotics including clarithromycin erythromycin and ciprofloxacin with higher loads typically observed over winter coutu et al 2013 golovko et al 2014 this is in line with the use of these antibiotics for respiratory infections where cases tend to peak in winter-early spring in areas where prescription data is not widely available or antimicrobial medications can be bought over the counter with ease wbe could provide a route for monitoring antimicrobial usage within a community which otherwise might go unobservedwith rising rates of amr the importance of understanding consumption habits in a community is critical one of the major advantages of wbe is the potential to distinguish differences between prescription and consumption of a pharmaceutical investigating ratios of parent compounds to respective metabolites or ratios between compound enantiomers in wastewater can inform on whether levels have originated from human excretion or from direct disposal of a pharmaceutical into the sewage system petrie et al 2016 furthermore the availability of pharmacokinetics data and excretion rates can allow back calculation to the estimated amounts of a pharmaceutical that a population has ingested zuccato et al 2008 this ability to distinguish between prescribed disposed and consumed is important as just because a pharmaceutical is prescribed does not necessarily mean it is used delayed prescribing is a strategy by which a general practitioner gp will make a prescription available but will ask the patient to delay from using in order to see if symptoms improve first the initiative has been evidenced to successfully reduce antibiotic usage in a handful of countries including new zealand norway and england spurling et al 2013 the use of wbe could therefore give valuable insight into the amounts of antimicrobials a population has actually consumed however whilst the analysis of parent compounds to metabolites provides valuable community usage data the analysis of antibiotic metabolites tends to be overlooked in wastewater analysis with parent antibiotics typically focused onwith regards to resistance further research is needed to understand how antibiotic usage in communities is impacting the bacterial communities in wwtps it is well recognised that wwtps are hotspots for resistance but the long term effects of exposing microbes to sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics in wastewater streams is not well understood andersson and hughes 2014 michael et al 2013when compared to antibiotics the prescription pattern of antivirals can differ as they are often less commonly prescribed on a day-to-day basis for example antivirals like tamiflu and relenza are stockpiled globally and are then deployed during pandemic periods which can result in high proportion of a community taking the drug in a short time window which is reflected in wastewater singer et al 2007 during the h1n1 influenza virus pandemic in 2009 tamiflu oseltamivir phosphate was heavily prescribed globally in response it has been reported that oseltamivir carboxylate a biologically active and persistent metabolite of oseltamivir phosphate was observed in surface waters during peaks of the outbreak leknes et al 2012 this was due to increased loads of the metabolite in wastewater which is widely known to not be readily removed by conventional wwtpsthe monitoring of drugs like antivirals and their metabolites not only informs upon drug compliance and the progression of an outbreak at the community level but like with antibiotics could provide critical information with regards to resistance the presence of these drugs or their metabolised forms in low levels in the environment could cause irreversible effects to the viral genome resulting in resistant effects for example it has been highlighted the guts of wildfowl could be potential oseltamivir carboxylate-resistance hotspots due to exposure to the metabolite in surface waters singer et al 2007 the rapid spreading of the h1n1 virus and the ease of which viruses can become resistant to antivirals stress the importance of population-wide surveillance tools and again the importance of combining chemical analysis with biological furthermore whilst a number of antiviral drugs have been detected in water bodies there is still a knowledge gap of understanding the environmental impacts their presence has in wastewater streams especially as they tend to pass through wwtp unchanged jain et al 2013markers of antimicrobial resistance are another group of key biological biomarkers the analysis of antimicrobial resistance genes args in influent wastewater could provide a broader perspective of the resistance genes present within a population this together with viral and bacterial monitoring arguably could give a more representative reflection of health of a community as currently much of the understanding of both diseases and resistance circulating within in a community are based upon clinical samples the results from clinics are often from a very small proportion of the population who are ill and hence not representative of the population as a whole as many people can be carriers of a disease or a resistance gene and not experience symptoms asymptomatic in case of diseases as previously mentioned it was highlighted by whos glass programme that a limitation is that current samples are focused on a clinical level and more epidemiological information on a population scale are needed for amr surveillance purposes world health organisation 2018bwbe could aid in providing this population-wide information to date a diverse range of args have been studied and reported on in wastewater typically through qpcr techniques mao et al 2015 rodriguez-mozaz et al 2015 sun et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 only a handful of studies to date have investigated relationships between the levels of antibiotics and abundance of args in wastewater streams correlations observed between antibiotic and respective resistance gene levels have been antibiotic dependant with some correlations observed gao et al 2012 novo et al 2013 rodriguez-mozaz et al 2015 xu et al 2015 however it is generally recognised that the relationship between antibiotic concentrations and resistance in wastewater is complex with further studies needed furthermore focus tends to be upon more common antibiotics resistances such as sulphonamides tetracyclines and quinolones hence there is still a knowledge gap regarding other antimicrobial classes of amr genes including those associated with antifungal resistance the effects of seasonality upon args in wastewater is another underexplored area though caucci et al reported strong seasonal abundances of args within wastewater with higher levels observed in autumn and winter which coincided with increased antibiotic prescribing in those months caucci et al 2016further work is needed to consolidate the impacts of antimicrobial prescribing at the community level on the abundance of args in wastewater particularly if this is to be utilised for epidemiology purposes establishing this link is recognised as challenging as several factors will potentially influence the abundance of args in sewers other than the selective pressures from antimicrobials being prescribed for example the environmental conditions in sewers has been shown to potentially impact arg abundance including temperature metal pollutants and changes in composition of microbial communities jiao et al 2018 novo et al 2013 sun et al 2016as with many other scientific innovations wbe is not immune to misuse and misrepresentation as wbe does not collect data on individuals the ethical risks are low however it will be necessary to manage privacy issues and the potential for stigmatisation of certain societal groups the ethical aspects of wbe for pharmaceuticals have been discussed elsewhere httpscore-costeuethical-guidelines-for-wbe it is generally accepted that populations over  10000 is enough to give anonymity and will pose no risk to smaller groups of people this is also relevant in the case of publications to reduce any risk of media misinterpreting the publications findingexpanding wbe to include infectious diseases will pose new challenges to the ethical considerations particularly with regards to disease outbreaks with regards to pathogen monitoring in wastewater population size will be important it has been highlighted by who for the case of monitoring polio in wastewater that large populations may decrease sample sensitivity and therefore sampling from subgroups may be required world health organisation 2003 as infectious diseases such as polio spread rapidly in urban areas the sampling of subgroups might also provide faster interventions by public health authorities however sampling from smaller subgroups in cities could lead to stigmatism of vulnerable groupsfurthermore outbreaks and the subsequent handling of them will differ between developing and developed countries due to the availability of resources and the quality of health and regulatory infrastructures in place however any outbreak regardless of geographic location are fragile situations thus care must be taken in the reporting of diseases being investigated within a community and social understanding of the situations will be crucial for example fear-trigged behaviours have been attributed as one of the major contributing factors to the spread of ebola in western africa shultz et al 2016 stigmatism surrounding individuals infected with ebola combined with a sense of distrust in health services and treatment centres resulted in efforts to hide cases this exacerbated the ebola spread as there was a decreased chance of survival of those infected with home treatment and increased chances of infecting family members or carers which in turn could infect other members of the wider communitysimilar ethical issues have also been observed with outbreaks such as sars influenza and tuberculosis which has resulted in who publishing the first comprehensive international ethics guidelines on public health surveillance in 2017 world health organisation 2017 these can be appropriately adapted to different social economic and epidemiological circumstances as wbe continues to expand in the direction of disease monitoring ethics should be considered and developed alongside ethics guidelines will need to be adaptable and consider factors such geographic location population and the biomarkers to be monitored to enable further development of this fieldit is widely acknowledged that effective surveillance systems are key for the rapid intervention and control of infectious disease outbreaks there is also a requirement for population-wide surveillance information to compliment current clinical data wbe has demonstrated significant promise in providing information on community-wide exposure and health status comprehensively and in near real-time the importance of effective surveillance has been highlighted recently with the case of the novel coronavirus covid-19 on the 31st december 2019 a number of cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in wuhan city in china just a week later on the 7th january chinese officials had reported a novel strain of the coronavirus world health organisation 2020b even with early intervention measures of quarantining cities in china and travel bans by the 3rd march 2020 the number of confirmed cases were 90892 across 73 countries with severe outbreaks occurring in south korea iran and italy world health organisation 2020c along with the current routes of global surveillance for the virus wbe if implemented could track spread of the virus and if linked with effective response system could help with management however in order to successfully apply wbe in infectious disease surveillance rapid advancements are required to tackle some of key challenges these include-complexity of wastewater matrix and the need for new biomarker extraction techniques-difficulties in accurate estimation of population size to account for temporal population size fluctuations-non-existent biomarker discovery pipeline for both chemical and biological markers-lack of analytical tools for cost-effective sensitive selective and multi-residue analysis of wide-ranging biomarker groups spanning from genes through to proteins and whole microorganisms
the ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2
identified as the causative agent of the corona virus disease 2019 covid-19
rapidly spreads to cause a global pandemic and poses a huge challenge for global
public health13
sars-cov-2 can spread rapidly through direct human-to-human transmission resulting
in high infectivity4 the indefinite latency and nonspecific
symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection makes the pandemic situation more
serious58 considering the seriously
increasing number of infected cases and widening geographical spread of
sars-cov-2 and when in absence of effective antiviral therapeutics and vaccines
for covid-19 there is an urgent need for easy-to-use high-throughput timely
accessible and on-site methods for rapidly and sensitively detecting sars-cov-2
infection at an early stage for responses against the ongoing coronavirus outbreak
and prevent and control the pandemic911reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr is the primary method for
the diagnosis of sars-cov-241214 however rt-pcr requires time-consuming
and labor-intensive rna preparation a reverse transcription step and
professional operation which decreases detection sensitivity and is difficult to
achieve on-site detection computed tomography ct imaging is an essential tool
for fast diagnosis of sars-cov-21516 while the specialized equipment of ct
fails to meet a large scale of requirement it may not provide the benefit for
point-of-care diagnosis of covid-19 various enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
elisa-based methods have been developed for sars-cov-2 diagnosis17 for example the extensively utilized colloidal
gold-immunochromatographic assays18 and lateral flow
immunochromatographic assays lfas1920 offer an immunoassay method for detecting
covid-19 which show the advantages of simplicity cost-effectiveness fast and
point-of-care testing still there are remaining limitations such as limited
sensitivity and incapability of quantitative detectionmicrofluidics-based diagnostic systems have been extensively developed and applied in
various fields2123
microfluidic technologies are able to integrate sample preparation reaction and
detection steps into a miniaturized chip microfluidics-based platform offers many
advantages 1 it enables rapid laboratory-quality sensitive detection at the
point of need 2 portability high throughput multiplex and automatic 3 it
significantly saves the volume of reagents and reduces the testing price24the determination of specific antibodies such as immunoglobulin gm iggm and
antigen is an easy fast reliable and accessible strategy for the diagnosis of
sars-cov-2 as well as efficient and large-scale screening of suspected cases at
point-of-care settings2526 the detection of igg and igm in serum or whole blood has
been demonstrated to be a reliable method for diagnosing covid-19 with high
specificity and sensitivity1827 additionally detecting sars-cov-2
antigen protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples has exhibited outstanding
advantages in clinical testing26to meet the challenge of the large epidemic we describe the development of a
point-of-care microfluidic platform integrating a homemade fluorescence detection
analyzer figure 1a sars-cov-2
diagnostic microchips figure 1b and
multiple immunoassays figure 1c for
detecting three biomarkers igg igm and antigen the microchip fluorescence
detector figure 1a measuring 28 cm
 22 cm  14 cm and weighing 38 kg integrates centrifugation
fluorescence detection and result display function which is portable for use in
the field this proposed platform allowed analysis of three samples or biomarkers
on the fluorescence detector simultaneously the simple and low-cost microchip
length  width  height 55 mm  35 mm  52 mm figure 1b and figure s1 was designed and fabricated by assembling top and
bottom plates made of polycarbonate that sandwich the middle layer containing
the sample analysis channel made of double-sided adhesive tape the microchip is
composed of a sample loading chamber a waste reservoir and a fluorescence
immunoassay fluid channel comprising a capture region and test regionfigure 1c describes the lab-on-a-chip
fluorescence immunoassay for detecting three biomarkers of sars-cov-2 the
combination of multiple biomarker detection offers outstanding performance such as
improving the sensitivity and accuracy for sars-cov-2 diagnosis the preparation
of the immunoassay microchip for detecting igg igm and antigen of sars-cov-2 was
achieved by matrix nanospotting which is listed in the supporting information the cost of a ready-to-use immunoassay
microchip is only about 5 yuan 071 dollar when 10 l of specimen blood
serum plasma pharyngeal swabs alveolar lavage fluid or fecal suspension is
added into the loading chamber of the microchip followed by the addition of 70
l of sample dilution buffer the biomarker of sars-cov-2 iggigmantigen
can specifically bind to the fluorescent microsphere fms labeled capture
antibody due to the large nanoscale of fms the antigenantibody complexes
are easily migrated with the flow under the capillary effect then the
antigenantibody complexes are immobilized on the
fluorescence test region through a second antigenantibody
affinity interaction with sars-cov-2 antigen or detection antibody if the
specimen does not include sars-cov-2 biomarkers no fms-labeled complexes bind on
the test region after 10 min immunoassay chips are placed in the portable
fluorescence analyzer followed by 10 s centrifugation to remove the residual
liquid in the channel into the waste chamber finally the fluorescence detection
results are read and obtained from the analyzer the whole assay only takes less
than 15 min this robust microfluidic immunoassay system can provide a useful tool
for sars-cov-2 diagnosis in public health laboratories as well as for timely
screening potentially infected patients to monitor and prevent the epidemic owning
to its capability of easy fast cost-effective and point-of-care detection
moreover this multiple detection system contributes to enhancing the accuracy and
sensitivity of the detectionthis sample-to-answer microfluidic immunoassay platform for multiple biomarkers
detection was initially determined by clinical samples from confirmed covid-19
patients and healthy samples all clinical specimens were collected and tested in
shanghai east hospital affiliated east hospital of tongji university shanghai
china figure 2a and 2b respectively show the fluorescence immunoassay detection results of igg in
serum samples from 2 patients and 10 healthy people we can observe that there is
a significant difference between the infected patients and healthy people by
comparing their final fluorescence value obtained from peak fluorescence intensity
minus background fluorescence intensity which was defined as the
t value and the t value could be
automatically read from the analyzer figure 2c p  00001 using the mannwhitney no
parametric test figure 2df
illustrates the similar detection results of igm in serum samples from 9 patients
and 7 healthy people the antigen testing results from nasopharyngeal swabs also
exhibited an obvious distinction between 10 patients and 9 healthy people figure 2gi these results proved
the feasibility of the developed method the cutoff values for igg igm and
antigen detection were determined as 200 t value 200 and 100
respectively according to these results it was also found that the fluorescence
values of serum samples from covid-19 patients figure 2be were significantly higher than the detection
results of pharyngeal swab samples figure 2h which is probably because of the different levels of these
biomarkers concentrations between serum samples and pharyngeal swab
samples these results indicated that it was more easy and sensitive to diagnose
sars-cov-2 infection via serum samples than pharyngeal swab samplesthe performance of the microfluidic diagnosis system was evaluated for monitoring the
progression of sars-cov-2 infection by igg and igm testing the testing results
are summarized in table 1 covid-19
patient 1 was detected as positive in serum on the seventh day after symptom
onset and the corresponding t values for iggigm were 2616 and
2886 respectively covid-19 patient 2 had positive results of igg
t value  11970 and igm t value 
4218 on the 14th day covid-19 patient 3 was diagnosed as positive for the igg
test t value  3381 and was diagnosed as negative for igm test
t value  1722 on the 2nd day after onset
t values for igg and igm of covid-19 patient 4 on the 14th
day was 7233 and 2568 respectively covid-19 patient 5 was diagnosed as
positive on the 18th day after onset with extremely high t values
for igg t value  26328 and igm t value 
19191 two healthy samples had negative results of igg t value
 537 600 and igm t value  1785 1032 within the five
patients all of the igg positives were 100 matched with clinical diagnosis
results only one false negative result of patient 2 was found for the igm test
which is probably because the igm level had not significantly increased on the 2nd
day of infection these results demonstrated that this immunoassay platform had a
high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of covid-19 which provides a
rapid approach to adequately meet the urgent need for the ongoing global outbreak
management of sars-cov-2the proposed method was further evaluated by dividing the sars-cov-2 infection into
three stages according to the patients infection time as shown in figure 3a the t value
for igg was increasing when the patients infection time was changed from
stage 1 infected 17 days to stage 3 infected over 14 days such a
growth trend was also observed when detecting igm in serum from covid-19 patients
figure 3b these findings further
proved that the microchip immunoassay could not only accurately identify between
sars-cov-2-infected and uninfected cases but also roughly discriminate the
severity of the patients infection development with high sensitivity and
reliability the proposed microfluidic immunoassay exhibits the comparable
superiority with the traditional colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay method
for sars-cov-2 detection18 such as easy-to-use low cost and
point-of-care detection moreover our method offers the ability of sensitive
multiple and quantitative detection based on fluorescence intensity
t value which shows promising applications for covid-19
diagnosis our method has been approved by the center for medical device
evaluation cmde in china and obtained european ce certificationin conclusion this study successfully developed a multiple detection tool for
diagnosis of sars-cov-2 which integrated diagnostic microchips a homemade
portable fluorescence detector and a microfluidic immunoassay approach the
multiple-testing platform was demonstrated to be easy-to-use rapid portable and
highly sensitive for point-of-care detection of sars-cov-2 within 15 min the
novel integrated diagnostic tool holds great promise for applications in
sars-cov-2 pandemic monitoring and control meanwhile this sample-to-answer
system is expected to be readily applicable for quantitative and sensitive
detection of biomarkers of many diseasesserum samples from 28 sars patients managed in the department of medicine queen elizabeth hospital hong kong were studied the diagnoses of all patients were confirmed by a positive rt-pcr test for sars-cov rna or anti-sars-cov antibody serologic test the clinical pictures of this cohort of patients were similar to those reported in the literature most patients 87 had abnormal chest radiographs on admission and some 13 presented early such that high-resolution thoracic computer tomography ct scanning was required to confirm the presence of pulmonary involvement patients were initially managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive therapy after the diagnosis of clinical sars was made and if there was no response to antibiotic therapy combination therapy with ribavirin 400 mg intravenously every 8 h and systemic steroids intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg every 68 h or intravenous methylprednisolone 3 mg  kg1  day1 was initiated the latter would be continued in a tailing manner for a total of 21 days intravenous pulse methylprednisolone in a daily dose of 500 mg to 1 g for 23 days would be initiated when the clinical condition radiologic presentation or oxygen saturation status deteriorated at least for two of the three the clinical characteristics detailed management plan and treatment regimen of this cohort of patients were described in a previous publication 2forty-four serum samples were available from 24 sars patients for initial expression differential mapping of serum proteins by protein chip array profiling to identify biomarkers that were differentially increased or decreased in the patients in addition 45 serial samples were available from four additional sars patients with comprehensive clinical follow-up seventy-two sera from 51 patients suffering from infections by influenza a virus 12 sera from 6 patients influenza b virus 8 sera from 4 patients respiratory adenovirus 12 sera from 6 patients respiratory syncytial virus 10 sera from 5 patients hepatitis b virus 10 sera from 10 patients mycobacterium tuberculosis 10 sera from 10 patients and various other bacteria with positive bacterial culture 10 sera from 10 patients plus 10 sera from 10 apparently healthy individuals who attended a familial nasopharyngeal cancer screening clinic but were shown to have no malignancy served as negative controls for this study the sera were collected and aliquoted for various routine laboratory tests remaining sera were kept frozen at 70 c until protein chip array profiling analysis was performedthe severity and extent of pneumonia in the four sars patients with longitudinal follow-up were assessed by a radiologist who was blinded to the clinical manifestations using a serial chest radiographic score derived initially to assess computer tomography of the chest 6 briefly the frontal chest x-ray radiograph was divided into six lung zones left upper zone left middle zone left lower zone right upper zone right middle zone and right lower zone with the upper zone representing the area above the carina including the apex the middle zone from the carina to the level of inferior pulmonary veins and the lower zone from the lower margin of the middle zone to the lung base the opacity in each lung zone was scored by a coarse semiquantitative method with a five-point scale of grades 04 representing involved areas of 0 524 2549 5074 and 75100 respectively the grading from each of the six lung zones was then added to provide a 024 point summation scalethe proteins in the sars and control sera were first fractionated by use of anion-exchange q-hyper d ceramic resin ciphergen biosystems in 96-well silent screen filter plates with a pore size of 045 m briefly the resin was prepared by washing with five bed volumes of 50 mmoll tris-hcl ph 9 three times and then equilibrated in the filter plate with 200 lwell of 50 mmoll tris-hcl buffer containing 1 moll urea and 22 gl chaps 1 moll urea buffer sera were then removed from the 70 c freezer and thawed and 20 l of each serum was denatured by adding 30 l of 50 mmoll tris-hcl buffer containing 9 moll urea and 20 gl chaps with vortex-mixing for 20 min at 4 c this sample mixture was then loaded in each well of the filter plate and 50 l of 1 moll urea buffer was added the plate was shaken on an orbital shaker for 30 min at 4 c and centrifuged with a collection plate placed underneath at 300g for 1 min to collect the flow-through fraction we then added 100 l of 50 mmoll tris-hcl buffer containing 1 gl n-octyl--d-glucopyranoside ogp at ph 9 ph 9 washing buffer to the plate and rinsed the resin under vigorous vortex-mixing on an orbital shaker for 10 min the rinse was then collected by centrifugation and mixed together with the previously flow-through fraction fractionation was then repeated similarly with a ph 7 washing buffer 100 mmoll sodium phosphate containing 1 gl ogp at ph 7 a ph 5 washing buffer 100 mmoll sodium acetate containing 1 gl ogp at ph 5 a ph 4 washing buffer 100 mmoll sodium acetate containing 1 gl ogp at ph 4 a ph 3 washing buffer 50 mmoll sodium citrate containing 1 gl ogp at ph 3 and finally an organic washing buffer 333 mll isopropanol 167 mll acetonitrile and 1 mll trifluoroacetic acid the six resulting serum anion-exchange fractions f1f6 representing the flow-through fraction at ph 9 the fractions at ph 7 ph 5 ph 4 and ph 3 and the organic fraction respectively were frozen at 70 c until chip binding was initiatedthe six serum fractions were then profiled on a copperii immobilized metal affinity capture imac cuii proteinchip array and a weak cation-exchange cm10 proteinchip array according to the instruction manual from ciphergen biosystems incorporation a pretreatment step is required for imac cuii chips but not for cm10 chips briefly the imac cuii chips were loaded on a bioprocessor and to each spot of the chips was added 50 l of 100 mmoll cuso4 buffer the chips were vortex-mixed vigorously and rinsed with distilled water after which 50 l of 100 mmoll sodium acetate buffer was added to the chips with strong vortex-mixing to remove the unbound copper the chips were then rinsed with water and equilibrated with a chip binding buffer 100 mmoll sodium phosphate buffer ph 7 containing 05 moll nacl we added 80 and 90 l of the chip binding buffer to each spot of the imac cuii and cm10 chips respectively we then added 20 and 10 l of the serum fraction to the imac cuii and cm10 chips respectively followed by vigorous vortex-mixing for 30 min at room temperature the chips were then washed twice with 150 l of the chip binding buffer with vortex-mixing for 5 min each they were then washed twice with 200 l of distilled water one microliter of an energy-absorbing molecule sinapinic acid in 500 mll acetonitrile5 mll trifluoroacetic acid was applied twice to each spot with the chip being air-dried for 10 min between applications the chips were read in a protein biological system iic mass spectrometer reader ciphergen biosystems incorporation and the time-of-flight spectra were generated by on average 338 laser shots per sample mass accuracy was calibrated externally by use of the all-in-1 peptide molecular mass standard ciphergen biosystems incorporation all controls were run concurrently and intermingled with the patients samples on the same chip and on multiple chipsvariability analyses were also performed to analyze spot-to-spot and chip-to-chip variations in the imac cuii and cm10 chips briefly reference serum samples were repeatedly bound to four different spots on four different chips using ion-exchange serum fractions 1 3 and 6 f1 f3 and f6 for imac cuii chips and fractions 1 and 4 f1 and f4 for cm10 chips the pooled cvs for peaks with signal-to-noise ratios 5 in the mass range of 2200 kda were calculatedthe protein chip profiling spectra from all serum samples were collected and analyzed by ciphergen proteinchip software 302 12 the mass range of 2200 kda was analyzed with molecules from 0 to 2000 da being eliminated because artifacts produced by the energy-absorbing molecule and other chemical contaminants usually lie at this mass range the peaks were baseline-subtracted calibrated on mass accuracy detected and clustered automatically by the analysis software in the biomarker wizard mode the normalized peak height or intensity of each peak detected in sera from sars patients was compared with that in the control groups by a nonparametric two-sample mannwhitney u-test 13 to identify the peaks that were significantly increased or decreased in sars patients briefly this was done by operation in two passes with the first pass detecting major well-defined peaks that were different between the sars and control groups and the second pass defining the remaining small peaks that differed between the groups using a criterion of a twofold or greater difference in peak height after data normalization in the two groups the normalized peak intensities in the sars patients with longitudinal follow-up were also correlated with the chest x-ray opacity score and other clinical manifestationsfor protein identification we subjected fraction 1 from the ion-exchange filtrate of the sars sera to further purification by use of immobilized copper ion spin columns ida-cu hypercel ciphergen biosystems the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in sample loading buffer for sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds-page the eluted antigens were then resolved by sds-page in a 412 gradient gel nupage invitrogen and a protein band at 116 kda in the gel was excised 14 this protein band was then subjected to overnight tryptic digestion in a reaction volume of 20 l of 50 mmoll ammonium bicarbonate buffer ph 80 containing 1 pmole of trypsin 15 subsequently 2 l of the digestion mixture was analyzed on a normal phase proteinchip array np20 -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid ciphergen biosystems was used to facilitate desorptionionization of the peptides generated from the tryptic digest the masses of the tryptic digested peptides were measured by the proteinchip reader and were used for initial protein identification from the profound database available on the internet httpprowlrockefelleredu the identity of the protein was further confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry msms fragmentation analysis of five major peptides at molecular masses of 14558 15508 16119 16409 and 19411 da generated from the tryptic digest on a abi q-star quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer equipped with a ciphergen proteinchip interface pci-1000 as described previously 16 fragmentation of each peptide generated a set of msms ion fingerprint which was then entered into a mass spectrometry database search engine mascot httpwwwmatrixsciencecom to find the closest match with known proteins as reported previously 17 a probability-based mowse score 33 thus generated indicates that the msms ion profile matched with good homology a known protein in the database with a p value 005 whereas a score of 90 represents matching with a known protein with almost absolute identitymore than 1000 biomarkers were resolved by protein chip array profiling of six fractions of anion-exchange filtrates from each sars patients serum fig 1 shows the gel view of part of the profiling results for sars patients in conjunction with the control patients in the molecular size range of 200015 000 da three serum biomarker clusters a b and c in fig 1  with differential expression in sars patients vs the controls were observed with the cluster at 11 695 da cluster a being increased in sars patients and the remaining two clusters at 9159 and 7784 da clusters b and c being decreased analyzing the whole serum biomarker profile we identified nine biomarkers at molecular sizes of 4922 5104 5215 5833 10 867 11 508 11 695 11 871 and 14 715 da respectively that were significantly increased and three at molecular sizes of 7784 8416 and 9159 da that were significantly decreased in sars patients vs the control infection groups and apparently healthy individuals table 1  further analysis of the distribution of the relative peak intensities of the biomarker at 11 695 da showed significant increases in sars patients against each individual control infection group or healthy individuals fig 2 to investigate whether the protein chip profiling results were consistent and reproducible we tested the ion-exchange fractions from a reference serum on four different spots on the same chip for spot-to-spot variability and on the same spot on four different chips chip-to-chip variability see table 1 in the data supplement that accompanies the online version of this article athttpwwwclinchemorgcontentvol50issue12 the cvs of the mean intensities of various peaks on imac cuii chips and cm10 chips were determined the chip-to-chip cvs for imac cuii chips varied from 1 to 16 for the small and large mass ranges whereas the spot-to-spot cvs varied from 1 to 14 cm10 chips had relatively higher variabilities with chip-to-chip cvs of 924 and spot-to-spot cvs of 826 however these variabilities were within a reasonable range for us to compare the peak intensities between the sars and control groups and to correlate the peak intensities of a biomarker at 11 695 da with clinical manifestations and radiographic scores in sars patientsto characterize the nature of the biomarker at 11 695 da we subjected the protein band at 117 kda as resolved by sds-page to tryptic digestion to generate a series of peptide fragments fig 3a  when we submitted these peptide fragments to the profound database search engine it matched with 100 probability to human serum amyloid a protein saa as the first choice saa had a matching probability of 1 with the second choice a human hypothetical protein xp299056 having a probability of 89  106 to further confirm the identity of saa we performed separate fragmentation analyses in a tandem mass spectrometer on each of the five peptides generated by the tryptic digestion of the 117-kda protein shown in fig 3b is one msms ion fingerprint generated from the peptide at 15508 da fig 3a  when we entered the ion fingerprint from this peptide into a mass spectrometry search engine database mascot it gave a mowse score of 90 which indicated almost absolute identity with human saa further confirming the tryptic mapping findings ion fingerprints from the remaining four peptides also confirmed saa as the predominant protein data not shownafter sars-cov infection was diagnosed the radiographic score of the first patient under longitudinal follow-up started to increase from a value of 6 to a peak of 16 and then gradually decreased to 12 9 and finally to 4 demonstrating a progressive recovery fig 1 in the online data supplement the saa concentration by protein chip profiling showed an increase that peaked earlier than the radiographic score but then also gradually decreased along with the radiographic score to a nadir when the patient was dischargedthe second patient had clinical sars symptoms with the sars-cov infection subsequently confirmed by rt-pcr on treatment her radiographic score remained high initially but then decreased with her progressive recovery fig 2 in the online data supplement protein chip profiling also revealed that the saa concentration increased initially but soon decreased similarly to the radiographic score the saa peak also preceded the scorethe third patient had typical clinical sars symptoms with the viral disease confirmed by paired serum anti-sars-cov antibody tests performed twice the clinical course after treatment was uneventful with a low radiographic score which later decreased to zero the saa concentration was low throughout the monitoring period fig 3 in the online data supplementdespite treatment the pneumonic condition of the fourth patient remained severe with high radiographic scores after 3 days of treatment her saa concentrations began to increase as well and were further increased on diagnosis of superimposed bacterial infections fig 4 in the online data supplement a subsequent decrease in the saa concentration was observed after initiation of antibiotic treatment although it remained significantly increased thereafter the patient still harbored the virus as indicated by positive rt-pcr from various sources the radiographic score remained high until she later died of the diseaseconventional cov usually causes mild and self-limiting cold-like symptoms but rarely severe lower respiratory tract infection 18 in contrast sars-cov can give rise to rapidly progressing pneumonia and can be associated with a significantly high mortality rate 23 most sars patients develop pulmonary infiltrates within 48 h of onset of disease 19 usually in the form of focal and unilateral consolidation in the peripheral regions of the lung 20 the consolidation usually clears quickly but a small proportion of patients progress to bilateral consolidation with extensive pneumonic involvement and protracted clinical course 7 serial chest radiographs are helpful in the diagnosis and monitoring of the clinical course 67 but their interpretation can be confounded by a lack of available experienced radiologists by interobserver variability and by the frequently suboptimal quality of portable films taken in isolation wards to avoid the spread of infections to other patientssars-cov antibody is usually increased at a later stage of disease 21 and is therefore not a good marker for monitoring the extent of disease with a high titer being predictive of the need for intensive care it has been suggested that quantitative real-time rt-pcr to determine the viral load 22 may have prognostic value 23 however its use in monitoring the disease is probably limited or at least unclear because the lung damage in sars appears to be more related to immunopathologic consequences of host response than to virus replication 22 it has also been suggested that lymphopenia or t-cell lymphopenia a fairly common occurrence in sars patients 2425 might potentially be a marker for disease activity however the presence of other superimposed viral or bacterial infections as well as the effects of treatment with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins might also affect the lymphocyte counts making them less ideal for monitoring the disease activity of sarsa high serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration has been reported to be associated with an adverse patient outcome 26 with concentrations peaking at the height of the disease and decreasing to within reference values on remission and after discharge 27 because this enzyme can originate from many sources such as the heart skeletal muscles erythrocytes and liver its increase might also be attributable to disease conditions in these organs or disease complications such as rhabdomyolysis 28 and hemolytic anemia after ribavirin treatment 2729 hence a change in lactate dehydrogenase activity might not be specific enough for monitoring the diseasemodern mass spectrometry has revolutionized proteomics studies by enabling rapid resolution of 1000 biomarkers from a single serum sample a large number of samples can also be processed within a short period of time seldi-tof ms or protein chip profiling has further advanced the technology by combining mass spectrometry with a surface-enhanced biochip which allows uniform and reproducible binding and desorption of biomarkers so that quantitative comparison of individually resolved biomarkers in serially monitored patients is possible 810 using this profiling technology we found at least 12 serum biomarkers that were differentially increased or decreased in sars patients among them an acute-phase protein saa was substantially increased in 44 sera from 24 sars patients in contrast to 72 sera from 51 control patients with different viral or bacterial infections using a clinically useful chest radiographic score we found that the saa concentration correlated well with the extent of pneumonia in four patients for whom serial serum samples were available in the first two patients this protein was increased similar to the increase in radiographic score in the active phase of the disease within the first 2 weeks of symptom onset the slightly earlier peaks in saa concentrations compared with the radiographic scores could perhaps indicate that saa might be an earlier marker in disease activity although this requires further validation in the third patient who had a milder disease course and lesser extent of pneumonic involvement saa concentrations remained relatively low throughout indicating that this biomarker correlates well with the severity of diseaseas an acute-phase protein synthesized by the liver saa has been reported to be increased in infectious and arthritic diseases 303132 and malignancies33 the increase has been found to be more prominent in some bacterial infections than in non-sars-cov viral infections 30 hence it is not surprising that the fourth patient demonstrated an increase in saa concentration in the near-terminal part of her illness when there were superimposed bacterial infections followed by a slight decrease after antibiotics were initiated this increase was probably additional to the persistent sars-cov infection as demonstrated by the persistently positive rt-pcr results for samples from various sources and her continuous severe radiologic abnormalities such an increase in saa was however in contrast to the low concentrations of this protein in the tested control viral and bacterial infections figs 2 and 3  and probably was a result of the severity of multiple superimposed infections and septicemia in this patient secondary severe bacterial infection which can cause high mortality is not uncommon in sars patients with pneumonia therefore increased saa concentrations in the presence of severe secondary infections in sars patients could be an advantage rather than a disadvantage if the aim is to monitor patients for severity of diseaseapart from saa other candidate acute-phase proteins such as 1-acid glycoprotein 1-antitrypsin haptoglobulin and c-reactive protein exist in various mammals 3435 saa was found to be more sensitive than c-reactive protein in detecting minor inflammatory stimuli in certain viral infections 30 and in noninvasive and early invasive bacterial infections 31 a study of feline disease conditions also showed that saa was the earliest marker induced when compared with 1-acid glycoprotein haptoglobulin and c-reactive protein 35 this lends support to the possibility that saa might also manifest earlier than the radiographic score although this remains to be confirmed in subsequent studiesdespite various reports on the potential applications of seldi-tof ms for the diagnosis of various diseases this technology has also been suggested to only detect high-abundance proteins such as acute-phase reactants 363738 as far as the sars-cov infection is concerned the major mortality-causing symptom is pneumonia therefore the discovery of acute-phase proteins that are strongly associated with pneumonia-related inflammatory events is expected and entirely matches with the theme of this study in pneumonia monitoring although the individual acute-phase proteins detected in this study may not be absolutely specific to sars-cov infection per se our preliminary data showed that the seldi analysis showing a distinctive pattern of increase and decrease of these proteins and their variants can distinguish sars from other infectious respiratory diseases very well data not shownthe precise mechanism for the increase of saa concentrations in sars patients remains to be investigated pulmonary infiltrates and acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage were frequently found in the sars patients 3940 it is also widely known that such infiltrates and diffuse alveolar damage can serve as stimuli for the production and secretion of a variety of inflammatory cytokines sars patients have been shown to have markedly increased plasma concentrations of two inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 il-1 and il-6 41 knowing that il-1 and il-6 can rapidly induce 1000-fold increases in saa in a synergistic manner 42 it thus perhaps explains the possible rapid induction of this acute-phase reactant at the time of sars cov infection with the encouraging correlation of saa concentration with the extent of pneumonia and the possible correlation of increases or decreases in the remaining serum biomarkers with disease conditions as well saa and probably the other biomarkers discussed could be used to monitor disease activity and response to treatment in sars patients

blood samples all samples were stored as aliquots at 70 c until proteinchip array profiling analysis was performedin the seldi proteinchip analysis the serum samples from the diseased and control groups were randomized and the investigator was blinded to their identity the seldi proteinchip analysis was performed as described previously 81013 for each set of binding conditions samples were analyzed in duplicate serum samples 2 l were denatured by addition of 4 l of u9 buffer 9 moll urea 20 gl chaps 50 mmoll tris-hcl ph 90 and incubated on ice for 20 min denatured serum samples were

intensities before data mining the normalized peak intensities of the duplicate measurements were averaged and log2-transformed the intraassay cvs of the normalized intensities of various peaks were 15to identify proteomic features associated only with disease we used 2 criteria a the normalized peak intensities had to be significantly higherlower in sars patients than in non-sars individuals and b the normalized peak intensities had to correlate with 2 or more clinicalbiochemical variables indicating their biological meaningfulnessthe significance analysis of microarray sam algorithm stanford university 81013 was used to identify proteomic features with concentrations significantly different between the sars and non-sars patient groups during sam analysis two classed unpaired data were selected as the data type and 5000 permutations were performed the false significant discovery rate was set to zero to avoid the identification of falsely significant proteomic features caused by multiple comparisons correlations between the differential proteomic features and various clinicalbiochemical features were examined by the spearman rank-order correlation testthe significant differential proteomic features correlated with various clinicalbiochemical correlations were subjected to two-way hierarchical clustering analysis as described previously 8 before clustering analysis the data of each proteomic feature were subjected to zero-mean unit-variance normalization the processed proteomic data and the serum samples were subjected to two-way hierarchical clustering analysis by the cluster and treeview 14 spearman rank correlation was used to calculate the distance and complete linkage clustering was performedfor protein identification proteins corresponding to the sedli peaks were purified by cation-exchange chromatography with the use of cm10 ceramic beads biosepra under binding conditions similar to those for cm10 proteinchip arrays briefly pooled serum samples were first denatured with u9 buffer and diluted with t4 or t9 sample binding buffer respectively after incubation for 120 min and subsequent washing the bound proteins were eluted from the cm10 ceramic beads with 1 moll nacl solution c18 ziptips were used to desalt the eluted proteins according to the manufacturers instructions millipore the desalted protein preparations were spotted on the gold-coated proteinchip arrays and examined with the proteinchip reader to confirm that the purified proteins had the same masses as the targeted sedli proteomic features after confirmation the purified proteins were resolved by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis in the absence of reducing agents proteins on gels were visualized by either colloidal blue invitrogentrade or silver staining ge healthcare the gel images were then digitized with a densitometer and analyzed by the pdquest gel analysis software ver 730 bio-rad protein spots with masses matched with the differential proteomic features were excised and subjected to mass spectrometric ms analysisprotein spots of interests were removed from the gel and subjected to trypsin digestion as described previously 15 the trypsin digests were then extracted and subjected to tandem ms msms analysis in the abi 4700 system applied biosystems trypsin peaks possible keratin contamination and matrix cluster peaks were excluded from subsequent collision-induced dissociation the msms spectra were then processed with data explorer software ver 44 applied biosystems the spectra were subjected to gaussian smoothing with a filter width of 5 points and the baselines were corrected with default settings peaks were detected based on a signal-to-noise threshold of 15 the fragment masses and intensities of each msms mass spectrum were subjected to an online mascot msms ion search httpwwwmatrixsciencecom to obtain the protein identities for the search parameters the maximum allowed missed cleavage in trypsin digestion was 1 partial oxidation of methionine phosphorylation of serinethreoninetyrosine and iodoacetamide modification of cysteine residues were selected the error tolerance values of the parent peptides and the msms ion masses were 01 and 03 da respectively a protein identification result was considered significant when the msms ion profile matched a known protein in the ncbinr 20050601 database with a p value 005 for each identified protein an accession number in the uniprot protein database ver 480 was reported when availablemore than 800 common proteomic features were identified and compared between the sars and non-sars patient groups using sam at a median false discovery rate of zero we identified 107 proteomic features that were significantly differentially expressed between the 2 groups fifty-two were increased and 55 were decreased in the sars groupto avoid identification of falsely significant proteomic features caused by systematic bias we considered only 20 differential proteomic features fig 1 and table 1  that were significantly correlated with at least 2 biochemicalclinical variables as sars-specific table 2  these potential biomarkers were found to be significantly associated with sars-cov viral load 2 correlated with sars-cov rna acute-phase reaction 10 correlated with c-reactive protein crp lung damage 12 correlated with lactate dehydrogenase ld liver function 15 correlated with albumin andor total protein immune response 11 correlated with neutrophil count 3 correlated with total leukocyte count and age 3 correlated respectively thus these biomarkers could reflect different physiologic conditions of the body after infection with sars-covin the dendrogram fig 2  majority of sars cases 95 were grouped under 4 clusters there were significantly more cases with poor prognosis required treatment in the intensive care unit icu andor supplemental oxygen during treatment in sars clusters 2 and 3the areas under the roc curves for most of the sars-specific proteomic features were between 0733 and 0995 the 2 biomarkers at mz 28 119 and 5908 gave the largest roc curve areas for the biomarker at mz 28 119 the roc curve area was 0987 95 confidence interval 09661007 fig 3a  at 97 specificity the sensitivity was 97 for the biomarker at mz 5908 the roc curve area of 1peak intensity was 0995 95 confidence interval 09851004 fig 3b  at 95 specificity the sensitivity was 100attempts were made to purify and identify the 2 biomarkers with the highest diagnostic values and the 2 biomarkers correlated with viral load the cm10 ceramic beads captured proteomic features similar to those of the cm10 proteinchip array the proteins eluted from the cm10 ceramic beads were separated and concentrated as protein spots by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis we successfully identified the protein spots with masses corresponding to the proteomic features with mz values of 5908 24 505 and 28 119 which were internal fragment of fibrinogen -e chain immunoglobulin  light chain and n-terminal fragment of complement c3c -chain respectively fig 4 this study demonstrates that the seldi proteinchip technology can identify serum proteins or protein fragments that are differentially regulated in adult sars patients to avoid identification of falsely significant differential proteomic features 16 we used a data-mining strategy similar to that used in our previous studies 1013 we considered only the differential proteomic features that were correlated with at least 2 biochemicalclinical features considered sars-specific this strategy was adopted to ensure that the identified disease-specific proteomic features had biological meaning and were not the product of systematic bias we successfully identified potential biomarkers reflecting various physiologic or pathologic responses of the body to sars infection including acute-phase reaction 717 lung damage 181920 impairment of liver function 212223 neutrophil activation 242526 and viral load 5102728the most sensitive marker the proteomic feature at mz 5908 which was negatively correlated with neutrophil count and with the largest chest radiographic changes was found to be an internal fragment of fibrinogen -e chain on the one hand we previously reported that a high neutrophil count was a risk factor associated with clinical deterioration in sars 26 on the other hand intravascular fibrin deposition has been observed in sars patients 29 vascular fibrin thrombi are often associated with pulmonary infarcts specific interactions between neutrophils and fibrin thrombi are well recognized 30 in addition neutrophils produce a neutral peptidegenerating protease that can cleave fibrinogen into peptide fragments 31 it is possible that fibrinogen andor its fragments are involved in the pathophysiologic mechanism linking neutrophil activation and lung damagethe next most sensitive biomarker is the proteomic feature at mz 28 119 this feature was identified as the n-terminal fragment of complement c3c -chain complement 3 c3 which is composed of an  chain mr 115 000 and a  chain mr 75 000 is the central molecule in complement systems comprising the classic alternative or lectin pathways on activation and subsequent inactivation of c3 several physiologic protein fragments such as c3c are produced when examined by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis c3c separates into a -chain mr 75 000 and 2 fragments of -chain mr 27 000 n-terminal fragment and mr 43 000 c-terminal fragment 32 the presence of free c3c -chain n-terminal fragment in the blood circulation might be the result of degradation of c3c in the sars patients the concentration of this c3c fragment was positively correlated with crp suggesting its positive association with the acute-phase reaction and with the activation of the complement system it is worth nothing that this c3c fragment contains a binding domain for complement receptor type 1 33 activation of complement receptor type 1 enhances phagocytosis of the neutrophils 34 and activates b-cell differentiation 3536 to date information about the activation of the complement pathway in sars patients has been limited liao et al 17 reported that there was no significant difference in c3 concentrations between sars and control patients another group demonstrated that sars-cov could trigger complement activation through the lectin pathway 37 the biological relevance of c3 in sars remains unknownthe proteomic feature at mz 24 505 which was increased in sars patients and was positively correlated with viral load was found to be immunoglobulin  light chain this finding is consistent with our recent finding of anti-sars-cov igg in 93 of sars cases at the time of sampling igg was first detected on day 4 of illness 38 higher igg concentrations were detected in patients with poor outcome ie requiring supplemental oxygen for hypoxia or treatment in the icuaside from using individual differential proteomic features as biomarkers one could combine all of the differential features to form a sars-specific fingerprint the sars-specific fingerprint not only could differentiate sars from non-sars diseases with similar symptoms but also could be useful in identifying patients with poor prognosis the prognostic capability could be explained by the fact that the identified differential proteomic features were correlated with clinical and biochemical features having prognostic values including viral load 2728 neutrophil counts 26 ld 26394041 and age 4041previously 2 research teams using the seldi proteinchip technology reported potential biomarkers in the sera of adult sars patients 711 in the present study the intensity of the proteomic feature at mz 7769 was significantly lower in sars patients mannwhitney test p 0001 in their study yip et al 7 also reported that it is significantly lower in sars patients mannwhitney test p  49  108 except for this proteomic feature the sars-associated proteomic features in these other studies were different from our findings these differences might be attributable to different selection criteria for the controls in the previous studies the control cases were either healthy persons or persons with viral infections from other clinics the extent of similarities of symptoms between the sars and control groups and the time point of blood collection were not considered in the present study the control group comprised suspected sars patients who were admitted to the same hospital as the sars patients but were later shown to be negative for sars-cov infection the symptoms in the sars and control groups and the time point of blood collection were very similar the biomarkers identified in the present study may thus have an advantage in an actual diagnostic setting compared with those identified in the previous studiesthe difference in the findings reported by yip et al 7 and the present study could be also attributable to the use of different profiling methodologies in their study yip et al 7 used a comprehensive profiling approach after being denatured with urea and detergent the serum proteins were first fractionated with anion-exchange beads to give 6 fractions which were later analyzed with copper proteinchip arrays and weak cation-exchange cm10 proteinchip arrays use of the comprehensive profiling approach would increase the chance of identification of more potential protein markers 8 in the present study we analyzed the serum proteins directly after purification with only cm10 proteinchip arrays at 2 different binding conditions ph 4 and ph 9 we chose the cm10 proteinchip arrays previously called wcx2 because kang et al 11 showed that this chip type gives the best profiling result when analyzing serum samples from sars patients by a direct binding approach 11 although the direct binding approach might lead to the discovery of fewer biomarkers such direct binding assays have higher potential to be modified for use as a clinical assay that can be used even when the protein identities of the disease-specific seldi peaks are not knownthe most commonly used assays for detecting sars are based on the detection of viral rna 6 or antibodies against the sars-cov 5 detection of viral rna is useful in the early phase of the disease whereas the serology test for antibodies against sars-cov is useful from 21 days onward the current study has demonstrated that within the first week after onset of fever similar to viral rna concentration the serum proteome contains both diagnostic and prognostic information the seldi proteinchip assay could be used for first-line detection of sars followed by the quantitative viral rna assay for confirmation once the disease is confirmed the treatment strategy could be adjusted according to the prognosis based on the seldi proteinchip profiling result and the viral rna concentrationin conclusion we have demonstrated that disease-specific proteomic fingerprints are present in the sera of adult sars patients they could be used to identify sars cases during the early stage of the disease with high specificity and sensitivity these markers may provide information about the patients physiologic status as well as prognostic information the 2 proteomic features having the highest diagnostic value were the n-terminal fragment of complement c3c -chain and an internal fragment of fibrinogen -e chain the proteomic feature mz 24 505 positively correlated with viral load was identified as immunoglobulin  light chain

the infectious disease caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 sarscov2 covid19 broke out in wuhan china and spread to almost every country in the world millions of people have been infected many have died and everyday life has changed completely the disease is accompanied by range of different symptoms figure 1 rapidly accumulating data show that prognosis for patients with covid19 is good in those with mild disease but severe cases show relatively asymptomatic early progression followed by rapid worsening after symptom onset culminating in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and significant disease manifestations figure 2 the presence of sarscov2 has been detected in multiple organs on autopsy including the pharynx lungs heart liver brain and kidneys highlighting the multiorgan tropism of this virus
1

early clinical experience suggested that older age and the presence of a number of comorbidities including hypertension cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus and chronic respiratory disease increased the risk of death in patients with covid19
2
 
3
 in addition the reninangiotensin aldosterone ras system specifically the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 protein has been identified as playing an important role in facilitating entry of coronaviruses including sarscov2 into target cells especially in the lungs
4
 
5
 therefore it has been suggested that angiotensin receptor blockers arbs and ace inhibitors which affect ace2 expression may influence the susceptibility to and severity of infection with sarscov2

hypertension is very common affecting an estimated 139 billion individuals worldwide
12
 and the prevalence of hypertension increases with age affecting approximately 70 of older adults
13
 in addition ras inhibitors such as ace inhibitors and arbs are recommended and widely used for the treatment of hypertension
14
 
15
 
16
 however hypertension is not a single clinical entity but it instead manifests as a number of different phenotypes in asians the disease is characterized by salt sensitivity high rates of masked hypertension exaggerated morning bp surge and nocturnal hypertension
17
 nearly half of all patients with hypertension worldwide 44 live in south or east asia
18

the hope asia network was established in 2016 and is a member of the world hypertension league
19
 
20
 the mission of the hope asia network is to improve the management of hypertension and organ protection toward achieving zero cardiovascular events in asia
19
 
20
 this has become even more relevant in the current pandemic with high rates of infection in several asian countriesthis guidance from the hope asia network summarizes the latest findings on covid19 and hypertension including evidencebased recommendations for the management of hypertension during the current pandemicon march 20 2020 the italian institute of health announced that there had been 3200 covid19 deaths in italy
21
 the patients who died had an average age of 785 years median 80 years range 31103 years and 987 had at least one comorbidity
21
 hypertension was a common comorbidity in italian cases affecting 738 of patients 52 of whom were taking arbs or ace inhibitors
21
 however there are number of factors that could potentially confound a possible relationship between hypertension and severe covid19 table 1
22
 
23
 
24
 
25
 
26
 
27
 the first is age both severe covid19 and hypertension are common in the elderly in addition the identified risk factors table 1 are generally associated with aging andor vascular disorders both of which are common in patients with hypertension therefore the risk of developing severe covid19 is more likely to be due to underlying vascular endothelial dysfunction andor organ damage than high blood pressure bp per se ace2 receptors are expressed by endothelial cells
28
 and postmortem examinations have detected the presence of viral infection in endothelial cells
29

the spike protein on the surface of sarscov2 binds to the extracellular domain of transmembrane ace2 with s protein priming by transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 to gain entry to host cells figure 3

30
 ace2 plays a regulatory role in the ras converting angiotensin i ang i into angiotensin 19 ang 19 or angiotensin ii ang ii into angiotensin 17 ang 17
31
 
32
 currently available data reflect a possible role for ace2 in heart failure myocardial infarction hypertension and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes mellitus and preclinical investigations suggest that activation of ace2 might have the potential to protect against hypertension and cardiovascular disease
31
 
33
 
34
 
35
 in addition angiotensin 17 appears to counteract the negative effects of ang ii attenuating inflammation suppressing vascular permeability and having vasorelaxant effects
36
 
37
 
38
 furthermore ace2 in the lungs and the reninangiotensin system has been shown to play a role in the pulmonary manifestations of coronavirus infection
39

interaction of ang ii with angiotensin type 1 receptors at1r activates a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 adam17 on the cell membrane via phosphorylation
40
 in turn adam17 cleaves the precursors of tumor necrosis factor tnf and interleukin il6 receptor il6r in the cell membrane to release tnf and soluble il6r
41
 tnf activates the nuclear transcription factor system nfb to induce the production of various inflammatory cytokines including il6 figure 4
42
 this represents a potential mechanism for the cytokine storm seen in some patients with covid19 and highlights the potential for agents blocking cytokine pathways especially the il6stat3 axis in managing covid19related cytokine storm
43

the fact that the sarscov2 virus uses ace2 as a mechanism to enter and infect cells meant that there was concern that cells with high ace2 expression would be most susceptible to infection with sarscov2 given that arb and ace inhibitors have been shown experimentally to increase expression of ace2 on cell membranes
28
 
44
 there was much discussion about the potential for higher infection rates and more severe disease in patients being treated with these agentsdespite the theoretical possibility that use of ras inhibitors increases the risk of infection with sarscov2 and the severity of covid19 illness analyses including patients from the current pandemic indicate that this does not seem to be the case table 2the effect of hypertension or therapy with ace inhibitors or arbs has been evaluated in at least three published studies to date table 2
45
 
46
 
47
 reynolds et al looked at history of antihypertensive usage in 12 594 patients undergoing covid19 testing in new york usa
47
 they did not find any association between the use of ace inhibitors arbs betablockers calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics and the likelihood of a positive or negative result on covid19 testing
47
 also in the united states mehta and colleagues failed to find any significant association between the use of ace inhibitors or arbs and covid19 test positivity
46
 similar findings were reported in a population casecontrol study from italy
45

data from four studies published by early may 2020 also failed to find a significant association between ras inhibitor use and worse outcomes in patients with covid19 table 2
48
 
49
 
50
 in one retrospective case series the proportion of patients using ace inhibitors or arbs did not differ significantly between those with severe vs nonsevere covid19 or between survivors and nonsurvivors
48
 however the inhospital covid19 mortality rate was higher in patients with vs without hypertension 21 vs 11
48
 in the other studies death rates for patients taking ace inhibitors andor arbs were actually lower than those in patients not receiving these antihypertensive therapies
49
 
50
 one of the studies from china reported that levels of the inflammatory markers high sensitivity creactive protein and procalcitonin were significantly lower in patients with hypertension who were vs were not receiving ace inhibitors or arbs
49

there are two possible mechanisms of cardiovascular damage in covid19 the first is direct viral infection of myocardial and vascular cells and the other is a systemic inflammatory reaction or cytokine storm figure 5 myocardial injury at the time of admission or due to disease progression is a strong indicator of poor prognosis in patients with covid19 troponin is a highly sensitive and wellknown marker of myocardial injurya systematic review and metaanalysis of data published between 1 december 2019 and 27 march 2020 including 4189 patients from 28 studies showed a significant trend for higher levels of cardiac biomarkers in patients with more severe covid19
51
 on metaregression analysis the only factor significantly associated with higher levels of cardiac injury biomarkers was the presence of hypertension p  03 in addition more severe covid19 markedly increased the risk of acute cardiac injury risk ratio vs mild disease 599 95 confidence interval ci 3041180 p  001 in turn the risk of covid19related death was significantly increased in the presence of acute cardiac injury risk ratio 385 95 ci 213696
51
 another analysis also reported that patients with severe covid19 had significantly higher levels of troponin than those without severe disease standardized mean difference 256 ngl 95 ci 68445 ngl
52

early data from wuhan china showed that 12 of patients admitted to hospital with covid19 had acute cardiac injury
53
 subsequent analyses investigated associations between underlying cardiovascular disease or myocardial injury and mortality in hospitalized patients with covid19 n  187
23
 patients with vs without myocardial injury defined as elevated troponin levels were significantly older 74 vs 60 years p  001 and more likely to have hypertension 598 vs 234 p  001
23
 
25
 during hospitalization those with myocardial injury had higher rates of ards 585 vs 147 p  001 acute renal injury 85 vs 03 p  001 and death 512 vs 45 p  001 the appearance of myocardial injury increased the risk of death by 426fold compared to patients without myocardial damage independent of cardiac function based on ecg and echocardiography findings figure 6

25

ddimer is a biomarker that reflects activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis
54
 ddimer levels of 2 gml were an independent predictor of inhospital death in patients hospitalized with covid19 in wuhan china hazard ratio 515 95 ci 1292067 p  001
55
 the 2 gml cutoff had 92 sensitivity and 83 specificity for predicting inhospital mortality and therefore might be a useful biomarker for predicting outcome and informing treatment decisions in patients with covid19 the cumulative rate of thromboembolic events in patients admitted to hospital in milan italy with covid19 n  388 was 21 28 of those in intensive care and 7 for those not in intensive care despite use of thromboprophylaxis in all patients admitted to the intensive care unit and threequarters of those treated on a general ward
56
 about half of all thromboembolic events occurred within 24 hours of hospitalization and 2 of patients developed dic
56
 a consensus statement on the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolismassociated covid19 infection has been published
57
 this recommends that patients with covid19 undergo assessment for the risk of venous thromboembolism and bleeding and are monitored regularly to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism and the use of strategies pharmacologic andor mechanical to prevent venous thromboembolism
57

key points regarding the clinical management of covid19 particularly in patients with hypertension based on evidence published before may 5 2020 are shown in table 4data that have been rapidly compiled during the pandemic to date indicate that there are a number of factors and biomarkers that can be used to identify patients with covid19 who are at high risk of more severe disease and adverse outcomes including death age seems to be the most important risk factor especially for covid19related death and hypertension is the most common comorbidity in covid19positive deceased patients
21
 other comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases smoking chronic lung disease chronic kidney disease and a suppressed immune system also increase the risks associated with covid19 infection especially when multiple comorbidities exist in the same patient
21
 thorough history taking and baseline assessments are therefore important another important screening tool is oxygen saturation which indicates severe disease if 94 on admission
3
 
58
 the relevance of ability to tolerate hypoxia was highlighted in an analysis from china showing that covid19 patients of highaltitude origin had a lower mortality risk than those from lower altitudes
59
 determination of relevant biomarkers especially troponin and ddimer provides an indication of myocardial injury and thrombotic risk and can help inform appropriate treatment strategiesfor nonhospitalized patients with covid19 ongoing management of comorbid conditions is essential to minimize risk this includes lifestyle factors such as diet and sleep along with maintaining regular medications eg antihypertensives and antidiabetics patients with hypertension on current therapy with ace inhibitors or arbs can continue treatment without any negative effects on covid19 outcomes ras inhibitors are particularly beneficial in patients who have heart failure or renal disease because they have a positive effect on prognosis for older patients with hypertension and no other comorbidities and risk factors calcium channel antagonists might be a good option for antihypertensive therapy maintaining good glycaemic control is also important because this might help reduce the risk of infection with sarscov2 and the severity of covid19
60
 in addition regular monitoring of home bp will help to ensure the achievement and maintenance of bp targets in patients with hypertensionlockdown requirements could impact on the ability of individuals to get regular exercise regular exercise is important for maintaining health status
61
 and to counteract the negative consequences of cardiovascular metabolic and respiratory diseases
62
 even if unable to get outside continuing some form of homebased exercise would be beneficial especially in older adults
63
 maintaining regular exercise could help to ensure that the current viral pandemic does not contribute to the worldwide obesity epidemic which in turn increases the rate of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities
64
 ensuring that the world population is not burdened by high rates of noncommunicable diseases might help lessen the impact of future pandemics given that patients with comorbidities tend to fare poorly during an infectious disease pandemic
64
 another potential benefit of physical activity is its ability to stimulate immune function
65
 something that is highly relevant during a global pandemichealth care professionals should also be aware of the potential noninfectious impacts of covid19 for example noninfected individuals might be at risk of developing stressrelated physical health conditions such as gastrointestinal disturbances and cardiovascular disease and psychological disturbances such as anxiety and depressionstrict lockdown and social distancing rules are being enforced in many countries to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus in addition a large proportion of elective or nonessential procedures have been postponed or canceled to allow health care systems to cope with the influx of infectious disease cases this has created a requirement for a large proportion of health consultations to be conducted remotely telemedicine strategies are ideally suited to facilitating patient management in the absence of facetoface consultations and the value of this approach which has otherwise been slow to be widely used in clinical practice has become clear
66
 
67
 one of the hidden blessings of the covid19 pandemic may be the widespread adoption of telemedicine approaches to improve patient managementoutofoffice bp monitoring is a recommended approach for the diagnosis and management of hypertension

75
 therefore this field of medicine is better placed than many to be able to continue to effectively manage patients during a global pandemicnew information and communication technologybased home bp monitoring devices that perform automatic fixedinterval bp measurement during sleep and store or transmit the data could facilitate a novel approach to patient management
76
 validated wearable technologies for evaluation of home bp
77
 
78
 might also be useful for patient monitoring and management during the covid19 outbreak telemedicinebased strategies for managing bp were implemented and used effectively during the aftermath of the great east japan earthquake and tsunami in march 2011
79
 highlighting their potential for use during the covid19 pandemic to ensure that patients with hypertension have wellcontrolled bp this has the potential to help mitigate the negative effects of hypertension on prognosis in patients with covid19patients with hypertension are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality if they become infected with sarscov2 although this is confounded by other factors such as age and vascular disorders however all usual antihypertensive therapy including ras inhibitors should continue physicians need to take a holistic approach to patient management due the wide range of possible complications and biomarkers can provide important prognostic information overall multidisciplinary management of covid19 based on a rapidly growing body of evidence will help ensure the best possible outcomes for patients including those with risk factors such as hypertensionall authors report no potential conflicts of interest in relation to this articlerecently the novel pneumonia covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has rapidly spread worldwide and become a pandemic despite city-wide quarantines and travel bans in many countries 1 by april 15 2020 2005196 infections and 134658 deaths have been reported in more than 210 countries humans have suffered several serious epidemics including sars h1n1 ebola zika mers nipah and covid-19 since 2000 2 3 these serious diseases caused by pathogens have made the effective monitoring of infectious diseases increasingly importantintegral components of public health include strengthening the supervision of infectious diseases realizing early warning and preventing infectious disease pandemics especially emerging infectious diseases there are many technologies to surveil the spatial-temporal characteristics of infectious diseases such as sentinel surveillance clinical-based surveillance questionnaires or surveys hospital admission data mortality and morbidity rates which hold great significance for infectious disease surveillance 4 however most of these approaches depend on acquired data and information such as incidence and mortality rates prescription data and hospitalization information and herein most of these systems are passive monitoring forms therefore these techniques are subject to bias resource insensitivity detection blindness and high cost 5 taking countries with limited health services as an example the incidence rate may be higher than the assumed value due to a lack of access to health services 6 there are blind areas for epidemic monitoring using traditional techniques because infectious disease testing is not available to everyone potential patients and asymptomatic patients cannot be effectively counted and monitored leading to an unknown extent of the spread for example it has been reported that approximately 60 of asymptomatic or mild sars-cov-2 infections may lead to a second outbreak 7 sometimes in serious epidemics laboratory facilities are easily overburdened and many cases are not reported in addition with the acceleration of global urbanization and the unprecedented growth in population higher requirements are proposed for rapid health monitoring and response which undoubtedly poses a challenge to the existing infectious disease monitoring and management systemtherefore novel monitoring and management approaches are needed for the prevention and early warning of infectious diseases these technologies should be flexible cost effective and scalable and should provide comprehensive and objective data in real time meanwhile they also need to monitor multiple diseases even rare diseases in limited resource settings considering the current insufficient clinical and laboratory information 8 it is valuable to provide a novel surveillance and early warning techniques to compensate for the shortcomings of traditional toolsmethods and to provide comprehensive and timely population exposure and disease results recently wastewater-based epidemiology wbe which can provide objective and comprehensive real-time assessments of public and environmental health status has developed rapidlyas an effective health assessment approach wbe has great potential for the prevention and early warning of infectious disease outbreaks for public health therefore we first briefly introduce the principle of wbe and its wide application then we discuss the feasibility of wbe in the supervision and early warning of infectious disease outbreaks caused by pathogens finally we discuss the existing constraints and future perspectives in the field of wbe as an early warning of infectious disease epidemicswbe is an integrated technique related to the extraction analysis data processing and interpretation of targets so-called biomarkers excreted from faecesurine in wastewater which provides comprehensive community health information untreated wastewater is obtained from wastewater collection points that serve communities located in clear geographical wastewater catchments it is important that as a whole the population contributes to the collection of wastewater from any wastewater collection point and the wastewater from this community can be regarded as its collected urine it is assumed that the identification and quantification of exogenous and endogenous biomarkers in community wastewater reflects the health status of the community population in real time these biomarkers are derived from specific human excretions such as metabolites or endogenous chemicals resulting from exposure to andor disease 9 as well as associated microorganismspathogens 10 which can reflect the health and living habits of the community because they contain rich biological and chemical informationsince daughton et al first proposed the concept in 2001 wbe has achieved great success he assumed that the analysis of drug residues in wastewater could be linked with population use 11 later zuccato et al achieved the goal of wbe for the first time in 2005 by successfully quantifying cocaine in wastewater to investigate cocaine consumption in the community 12 since then research on wbe has been conducted around the world 13 initially the focus was entirely on the abuse of illicit drugs httpwwwemcddaeuropaeuactivitieswastewater-analysis such as heroin14 cocaine15 ketamine16 methamphetamine13 and new psychoactive substances17 most countries have monitored the use of illicit drugs through wbe for epidemiological studies notably china uses wbe for practical policy making and action related to drug control activity18to date apart from the evaluation of drug abuse wbe has been expanded to various biomarkers 9 such as pesticides5 and even heavy metals19 the scope of application of wbe ranges from the assessment of drug abuse and population health to the assessment of social demographic and economic correlates of food and chemical consumption 20 wbe has also been successful in monitoring drug consumption lifestyle choice and population exposuresome studies have discussed the future of wbe and expanded it to include biomarkers related to other aspects of public health including diet stress and disease-related biomonitoring5 21 due to the wide variety of endogenous chemical and biological biomarkers related to diseases the potential of wbe for monitoring infectious disease outbreaks and epidemic transmission at the community level is obvious 4wbe can be used as a complementary monitoring technique to provide rapid and reliable information about the population to inform the community of what diseases exist and help to monitor disease outbreaks see figure 1
 when the presence of biomarkers is reported the daily load in the wastewater is usually reported in addition to normalize cities of different geographical locations and population sizes to allow for comparison daily load per capita can be reported the back calculation process for biomarkers throughout the community can provide an unbiased response to key aspects of infectious disease information in addition not only can the spatial-temporal trends be determined but this information can also be monitored in real time to detect deviations from the general trend as early as possible due to cost and logistical challenges wbe provides advantages compared to biomonitoring technologies that focus on small target groups as wbe is population wide and thus maintains the anonymity of individuals compared with other traditional surveillance systems wbe can provide timely analysis which can allow public services to respond quickly and adopt possible health interventions before infectious disease transmission and outbreaksgenerally for infectious diseases it is important to obtain two pieces of information namely pathogen information and host-guest information that is some physiological indexes of infection22 the pathogenic information includes pathogens from bacteria viruses and other microorganisms that cause serious infectious diseases pathogen detection of wastewater influent could trace the source of pathogen carriers through pipeline backtracking thus identifying the area of disease spread in the population there have been many reports about virus determination in wastewater 23 24 25 26 wastewater analysis of polio has been used since the 1980s when finland27 and israel28 successfully analysed wastewater to assess the spread of polio the who has issued guidelines for monitoring polio in wastewater samples using environmental monitoring 4 wastewater analysis can also be used for retrospective prediction of the outbreak of hepatitis a and norovirus29 in terms of the covid-19 pandemic many scientists are trying to use wbe to detect sars-cov-2 in wastewater to screen potential virus carriers and provide early warning of covid-19 outbreaks in the community 30another important consideration is the host-guest information caused by infectious diseases such as cough blood protein inflammatory and immune information for diagnostic purposes urinary protein-based biomarkers are considered promising candidates for wbe31 which is desirable not only because of the non-invasive nature of the test but also because it is a previously unexplored source of potential disease and health biomarkers32 the feedback of this information is related to protein-based inflammatory biomarkers which are a group of important endogenous markers that are sensitive to changes in the body as early indicators of disease33 34 apart from protein-based biomarkers other human health biomarkers in wastewater such as nucleic acids have been reported 35 for example genetic information-related diseases can also be detected in wastewater 36 it is believed that host-guest information related to infectious diseases in wbe will provide valuable new insights for community public health and have important implications for potential infectious diseasesalthough the principle of wbe is simple and provides an attractive advantage for public health monitoring there are still some challenges to be considered the first is that the wastewater matrix is complex the biomarker concentration in wastewater is much more dilute than that in urine and the wastewater substrate is a complex working environment37 as mentioned above wastewater contains a wide range of chemical and biological substances that can provide incredible amounts of information about the population however one disadvantage of having such a large amount of information is that it must be successfully extracted from the matrix and subsequent analysis of specific targets may be difficult taking protein-based biomarkers as an example although it is generally believed that proteomics in wbe can provide valuable new insights for community public health methods for the analysis of proteins in wastewater are lacking31the complexity of the wastewater matrix is also challenging for for pathogen detection the main method for pathogen analysis is nucleic acid-based pcr while there are various pcr inhibitors in wastewater such as fat protein and other chemicals that may affect subsequent pcr analysis in addition when dnarna is extracted from pcr inhibitor-rich samples the various commercial extraction kits sometimes show different efficiency and consistency38 39 this challenges meaningful comparisons across studies and the determination of spatial-temporal trends of pathogensto solve this problem progress in molecular biology technology provides new methods for genetic material analysis including digital pcr dpcr and next-generation sequencing technology in dpcr the absolute quantity of the target gene is calculated by dividing dnarna samples into thousands of reaction wells and using poisson distribution statistics due to this distribution effect when analysed by dpcr the effect of pcr inhibitors in wastewater is small40 next-generation sequencing is another promising technology that provides substantial information about the complex microbial communities in the samples such as the identification of various pathogens therefore next-generation sequencing represents an important direction in the future extraction methods such as spe and immunoassay as well as sophisticated analytical tools such as advanced mass spectrometry have enabled the analysis of a large number of compounds41 in future development more accurate and precise analysis methods are needed to obtain more infectious disease information from wastewaterin addition the ultimate goal of wbe is to achieve on-site monitoring and provide real-time data which is also a guarantee of using wbe to provide early warning timeliness of infectious disease outbreaks analytical tools are required for simple rapid cost-effective sensitive selective and multi-target analysis the latest developments in sensor methods make field measurements possible so that the system can provide real-time infectious disease and public health information see figure 2
 we also propose tracing covid sources using an inexpensive and efficient paper-based biosensor 43 at present the research in this area is relatively weak and only a few scientists have performed related studies 21 this is an important challenge for wbe with a wide application of early warning of infectious diseases and many more scientists should focus on this technical limitation in the futureapart from the limitations mentioned above biomarkers in pipelines must be developed for infectious diseases especially emerging infectious diseases endogenous and exogenous biomarkers which can provide key information related to human health have to be screened carefully the biomarkers must be discharged through urine and faeces and need to be specific to human metabolism ideally the metabolic process involving biomarkers should be well understood to ensures that the biomarkers in wastewater are from human sources only not external sources37 the biomarker concentration must also be within a certain range to detect biomarkers in wastewater downstream44 another important feature is that biomarkers must be stable not only in wastewater systems but also during sampling and storage45 therefore it is important to find suitable biomarkers for specific infectious diseases and to determine their characteristics in wastewater such as stability for the application of wbe in the supervision and early warning of various infectious diseasesanother challenge is that the uncertainty about the size of the population due to population fluctuation can cause problems in the monitoring of infectious diseases in wastewater because the presence of tourists or commuters in a catchment area may make it difficult to monitor the actual infectious diseases in the community46 for example it is impossible to distinguish whether pathogens in wastewater originate from visitors passing through or from individuals within the community there are several technologies that can be used to reduce sources of uncertainty related to population size such as water chemistry parameters of mature analytical methods which can help to estimate the population contributing to the catchment area of the wastewater collection points during a specific period of time47 48 however the results are affected by the composition of wastewater which leads to additional uncertainties related to these techniques such as sample collection and analysis variability 46 49 50the presence of pathogens in wastewater whether from catchment residents or not still provides critical information as members of the population may unconsciously come into contact with infected individuals this may indicate possible diseases in the community thus providing valuable time for proper preparation and response however we should objectively recognize the limitations of wbe and develop a reliable and standardized method to make the research more reliable and allow for comparison in the futureit is generally believed that an effective monitoring system is the key to quickly intervening and controlling infectious disease epidemics wbe shows great potential in providing complete health status information in a comprehensive and near real-time manner at the community level wbe can also be provided for the whole population to supplement current clinical data apart from the current global monitoring of covid-19 in clinics and labs if wbe is implemented it could be used to track the source of the virus identify the locations of potential virus carriers and provide an effective early warning furthermore if it is linked to an effective response system wbe can be helpful for epidemic surveillance however to effectively apply wbe to infectious disease monitoring and early warning much work remains for implementation on a larger scale and rapid progress is needed to address some of the key challenges mentioned above this work requires the cooperation of various related research fields sars-cov-2 will certainly not be the last novel virus to emerge and seriously damage global public health we hope that regardless of the identity of the pathogens that cause the next major outbreak we can provide early warnings and effective epidemic supervision through wbethe authors declare no competing financial interestthe authors declared no conflict of interestin december 2019 covid-19 was first described in wuhan china in patients complaining of flu-like symptoms1 the virus was isolated and identified as a new strain of coronavirus now named sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 mortality rate of covid-19 is estimated to be below 1 2 mainly due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction cardiovascular complications of covid-19 received less medical attention nevertheless the first cases of myocarditis in covid-19 patients have been reported3 4 5 6 moreover myocarditis was recognized as the cause of death in some covid-19 patients7 pathology is usually focal within the myocardium but there is a risk of arrhythmia as well as progression to fulminant heart failure and cardiogenic shock this article outlines the possible pathophysiology of covid-19-related myocarditis its clinical presentation as well as the associated arrhythmias the criteria for screening and management of myocarditis relating to covid-19 are also proposedmyocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart characterized by inflammatory infiltrates and myocardial injury without an ischemic cause8 the most commonly identifiable cause of myocarditis in the united states other developed countries is viral9

10 esfandiarei and mcmanus8 proposed that the pathophysiology of viral myocarditis is a combination of direct cell injury and t-lymphocytes-mediated cytotoxicity which can be augmented by the cytokine storm syndrome interleukin-6 il-6 appears to be the central mediator of cytokine storm where it orchestrates the pro-inflammatory responses from immune cells including the t-lymphocytes11 this causes t-lymphocyte activation and a further release of inflammatory cytokines which stimulate more t-lymphocytes leading to a positive feedback loop of immune activation and myocardial damage cardiotropism of the t-lymphocytes is thought to arise from the interaction between the heart-produced hepatocyte growth factor hgf and c-met a hgf receptor on nave t-lymphocytes12
despite being a minor cause of all viral myocarditis cases human coronaviruses have been linked to myocarditis in patients of all age groups13 14 15 the viral rnas of mers-cov and sars-cov which are close relatives of sars-cov-2 were found in the heart tissues of infected animals suggesting that these coronaviruses possess cardiotropism16

17 furthermore some coronavirus proteins were shown to render them highly infectious to the human cells nakagawa et al
18 demonstrated that mers-cov-4a a mutant mers-cov strain which lacks the 4a accessory protein had less efficient replication in the helacd26 cells compared to the wildtype mers-cov it is thought that the 4a accessory protein inhibits protein kinase r-mediated phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 218 failure to phosphorylate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 impairs stress granule formation the stress granules help sequester the host proteins important for translation and attenuate viral protein syntheses therefore its suppression promotes viral replication similarly sars-cov enhances its rna translation via the nsp1 protein19
sars-cov-2 gains entry into the human cells by binding its spike protein to a membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace220 however the spike protein must first be cleaved at the s1s2 and subsequently at the s2 sites to enable binding to the ace2 cleavage at the s1s2 site appears to be mediated by tmprss2 a serine protein20 the ace2 can be found on the ciliated columnar epithelial cells of the respiratory tract type ii pneumocytes as well as cardiomyocytes21

22 therefore it is plausible that sars-cov-2 infects the human heart especially when there is heart failure since ace2 is upregulated23 although the presence of viral receptors does not always predict tropism24
there are at least 6 known accessory proteins which can be transcribed by the sars-cov-2 genome25 it remains to be determined whether any of the accessory proteins do provide infectivity advantage as in mers-cov and sars-cov figure 1
summarizes the possible mechanism of sars-cov-2 myocardial infection we also provide the speculated risk factors for developing the covid-19-related myocarditis in supplementary figure 1it is unclear how prevalent myocarditis is among covid-19 patients this is partly because the early reports often lacked the specific diagnostic modalities to assess myocarditis some argued that up to 7 of the covid-19-related deaths were attributable to myocarditis26 however this was assumed and not based on a confirmatory diagnosis of myocarditis and may be an overestimate on the other hand many laboratories are rationing tests and first screening for known pathogens resulting in flu-like symptoms if a positive pathogen is identified then testing for sars-cov-2 is not performed this is erroneous and likely to miss the true frequency of sars-cov-2 infection as it assumes mutual exclusivity of sars-cov-2 one report has identified 245 of covid-19 patients to have co-infection with other viruses27 hence it is possible that many cases of covid-19-related myocarditis were missed due to a lack of sars-cov-2 diagnosiscertain ethnic groups may be disproportionately affected by sars-cov-2 covid-19 death rates were shown to be higher among the african-american population than other ethnicities in many american states28 whilst this may partially be explained by the higher cardiovascular risk factors or genetic predisposition to poorer cardiac outcomes29 health care disparities cannot be dismissed bias in the health and care provisions may be the driving force behind disproportionate suffering in minoritiesarrhythmia is recognized as one of the possible clinical manifestations of covid-19 patients one observational study of the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients in hubei china reported a 73 incidence of heart palpitations among its 137 patients30 moreover wang et al
31 reported that arrhythmia was a cause of icu transfer in 444 of covid-19 patients caution is encouraged when interpreting these data as the sample size tends to be small and hence prone to overestimation the exact nature of the arrhythmias was also not usually reported rendering it difficult to assess whether they are secondary to other conditions such as electrolyte imbalance or pre-existing arrhythmias the actual prevalence of arrhythmias in covid-19 patients therefore remains unknown nevertheless arrhythmias could occur in the context of myocarditis peretto et al
32 reported in a recent study that 787 of myocarditis patients exhibited some forms of ventricular arrhythmias the characteristics of arrhythmias also differ between the active and healed myocarditis32 suggesting that the pathophysiology is dependent on the stage of myocardial injuryconcerning sars-cov-2 the possible pathophysiology of arrhythmias includes 1 direct injury to cardiomyocytes disrupting the plasma membrane and electrical conduction 2 infection of the pericardium causing massive edema 3 ischemia from the microvascular disease due to the possible infection of the pericytes33

34 4 re-entrant arrhythmias due to myocardial fibrosis or scars and 5 the pro-inflammatory cytokines predisposing to arrhythmogenicity figure 2
 scenarios 1 2 and 3 could occur in the acute setting while scenario 4 and 5 occur in chronic or healed myocarditis regarding the fifth scenario it was shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines eg il-6 might cause the displacement of plakoglobin a desmosomal protein from the cardiomyocyte membrane35 this could be arrhythmogenic as inadequate cell-to-cell adherence is postulated to damage the cell membrane leading to cardiac cell death and fibrofatty replacement36 moreover reduced surface expression of desmosomal proteins is a known etiology of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies36 substantial evidence has now suggested an increase in serum il-6 in covid-19 patients especially in those with severe presentations37 it is therefore plausible that sars-cov-2 infection precipitates arrhythmias in patients with a genetic predisposition clinicians should be vigilant for arrhythmias especially in the areas where both the covid-19 burden and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy prevalence are high eg the north-eastern veneto part of italy36
clinical presentation of sars-cov-2 myocarditis varies from one case to the next patients may present with relatively mild symptoms eg fatigue and dyspnea4

5 while some reported chest pain or chest tightness on exertion3

6 many patients do deteriorate showing symptoms of tachycardia and acute-onset heart failure with cardiogenic shock3 4 5 in these severe cases patients may also present with signs of right-sided heart failure including raised jugular venous pressure peripheral edema and right upper quadrant pain10 the most emergent presentation is fulminant myocarditis defined by ventricular dysfunction and heart failure within 2-3 weeks of contracting the virus8 the early signs of fulminant myocarditis usually resemble those of sepsis ie a patient often presents febrile with low pulse pressure cold or mottled periphery and sinus tachycardia10
blood tests from myocarditis patients often show elevated lactate and other inflammatory markers including c-reactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate and procalcitonin which are usually raised in keeping with the clinical presentation of infection it is critical to distinguish fulminant myocarditis from sepsis as fluid resuscitation a common sepsis protocol exacerbates fulminant myocarditis with fluid overload we encourage testing the patients for the baseline cardiac enzymes eg troponin and n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide nt-probnp on hospital admissions as the cardiac troponin i ctni ctnt nt-probnp and bnp are usually elevated in myocarditis due to the acute myocardial injury and possible ventricular dilatation elevations of both troponin and nt-probnp were observed in the covid-19-related myocarditis cases3 4 5 6 although negative troponin cannot exclude myocarditis particularly for the atypical forms such as giant cell myocarditis or for those in the chronic phase negative serial high sensitivity cardiac troponin is still helpful in the acute phase and makes acute myocarditis significantly less likely in covid-19 patients the nt-probnp could also rise secondary to myocardial stress a possible knock-on effect from severe respiratory illness38
electrocardiogram ecg abnormalities commonly seen with pericarditis such as st elevation and pr depression may be observed in myocarditis9 nevertheless they are not sensitive to detect the disease and their absence is not exclusionary for instance one of the covid-19-related myocarditis cases showed neither st elevation nor pr depression3 other ecg abnormalities including a new onset bundle branch block qt prolongation pseudoinfarct pattern premature ventricular complexes as well as brady-arrhythmia with advanced atrioventricular nodal block can be observed in myocarditisacute coronary syndrome in the context of raised cardiac troponin the acute coronary syndrome is highly suspicious but epicardial disease can be ruled out via coronary angiography however many covid-19 patients were reported to have a detectable level of ctni even when there were no overt cardiac symptoms38 and does not generally represent type 1 myocardial infarction39 it is possible that the raised troponin is a result of an exacerbation of the patients subclinical coronary artery disease by sepsis which increases the cardiac oxygen demand this worsens their oxygen supply-demand mismatch which could precipitate ischemia which results in type 2 myocardial infarction serial cardiac biomarkers can help detect myocardial injury especially in the event of rising biomarker trendsepsis-related cardiomyopathy a case series study showed that 67 of critically-ill covid-19 patients required vasopressor and that 33 developed cardiomyopathy40 this raises suspicion of sepsis-related cardiomyopathy a disease characterized by reversible myocardial dysfunction the myocardial injury is thought to arise from raised nitric oxide production which suppresses the cardiomyocytes response to calcium and downregulates the hearts 1-adrenergic receptors41 the three cardinal signs of sepsis-related cardiomyopathy are a left ventricular dilatation b impaired ejection fraction and c recovery in 7-10 days41
stress-induced cardiomyopathy takotsubo cardiomyopathy a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy characterized by transient weakening of the cardiomyocytes and subsequent ballooning of the apex its clinical manifestations mimic those of acute coronary syndrome eg chest pain ecg abnormalities and elevations of the cardiac biomarkers however takotsubo cardiomyopathy is usually preceded by an emotional or physical stressor42 of note a case report described a covid-19 patient who initially presented as having reverse takotsubo cardiomyopathy a variant form of takotsubo cardiomyopathy6
the american heart association aha10 recommends further testing for the patients with signs consistent with myocarditis with one or more cardiac imaging such as an echocardiogram or cardiovascular magnetic resonance cmr because it is portable an echocardiogram is usually more readily deployed especially under time and resource constraints devices such as the hand-held point-of-care ultrasound can be advantageous in terms of accessibility and the relative ease to disinfect the device for infection control the cardinal signs of myocarditis on echocardiogram comprise increased wall thickness chamber dilatation and pericardial effusion in the background of ventricular systolic dysfunction whilst cmr offers major imaging advantages over echocardiography it is limited by out-of-hours availability the requirement for some breath-holding slower throughput and given high contagiousness of covid-19 the requirement for deep cleaning after use where possible to perform cmr the results should be interpreted according to the revised lake louise consensus criteria43 a edema b irreversible cell injury and c hyperemia or capillary leak figures 3a-3f demonstrate the typical cmr findings of myocarditis the cmr myocardial edema andor scarring were observed in all of the sars-cov-2 related myocarditis cases where cmr results were reported4 5 6 where cmr is proven prohibitive cardiac computerized tomography ct scan with contrast enhancement and ecg-gating is an effective alternative especially when the patient is to undertake the high-resolution ct scan of the chest for assessment of the acute respiratory distress syndrome figure 3j contrast-enhanced cardiac ct will add very little scanning time and it is particularly useful in this situation to perform a test rapidly with minimal requirement for breath-holding44 without the cmr or contrast-enhanced ct results it is arduous to distinguish myocarditis from other differential diagnosesboth the aha and european society of cardiology esc recommend emb as the definitive diagnostic tool for myocarditis however both recognized the limitation accompanying emb in terms of expertise required contagious spread risk and false-negative rate9

10 if obtained the emb samples should be immunohistochemically tested for the inflammatory infiltrates and rna-dna extraction performed to test for the presence of viral genomes45 regarding the contagious spread risk should coronary angiography be deemed necessary it is reasonable to perform the right heart procedures andor emb concomitantly as these will add minimal risk whilst adding 15-minutes to the procedure time it also serves as an opportunity for accurate diagnosis and provides tissues for the development of specific biomarkers which could be useful for developing a diagnostic test for sars-cov-2 myocarditis in the tragic situation where a patient is deceased we suggest that an autopsy be performed and include the heart as this provides an opportunity to observe its gross and microscopic pathology including multiple left and right ventricular segments this may illuminate the new biological pathways for covid-19 treatments  the knowledge which is critically needed and will bring immense societal benefit in this trying timewhilst the current focus on acute inflammation and injury to the heart is receiving attention the long-term effects of healed myocarditis are completely unknown the majority of infected patients experience mild self-limiting symptoms managed in the community and are not undergoing clinical testing such as an ecg or cardiac imaging as the emphasis is to evaluate and admit patients with severe lower respiratory tract symptoms many patients with possible myocarditis will never be evaluated some of these may survive the acute event but may be at risk of subsequent arrhythmias in a study of patients with active and healed myocarditis monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and regular ventricular arrhythmias were more frequent in healed than acute myocarditis32 however the presence of viral genome on emb was not associated with the occurrence of malignant arrhythmias32
the aha recently published a scientific statement on the recognition and initial management of fulminant myocarditis10 it recommends implementing the initial management protocol for cardiogenic shock in patients with fulminant myocarditis this includes administration of the inotropes andor vasopressors and mechanical ventilation the longer-term management involves mechanical circulatory support such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ventricular assist device or intra-aortic balloon pump the esc did not endorse the use of intravenous immunoglobulin due to a lack of supporting evidence9 and discouraged the use of corticosteroids in active-infection myocarditis citing the ineffectiveness of corticosteroids in a randomized-controlled trial46
case reports of coronavirus-related myocarditis provide a glimpse into the efficacy of some of the aforementioned treatments supplemental table 1 is a summary of 9 case reports on patients with coronavirus-related myocarditis mechanical circulatory support was deployed in 27 cases where treatment modalities were reported3

47 presumably in a more hemodynamically stable case medical treatment consisting of inotropes or vasopressors was sufficient to mitigate the ventricular systolic dysfunction4

13

48 in some cases immunomodulatory treatments were given zeng et al 20203 and hu et al 202048 reported the use of corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin a recent meta-analysis 49 on corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin used in pediatric myocarditis concluded that the intravenous immunoglobulin may improve the ventricular systolic function but failed to find the support for corticosteroid use however immunosuppression might pose a risk for more severe clinical disease especially when there is active viral replication therefore it is reasonable to withhold or minimize the use of immunosuppression in sars-cov-2 patients especially in the setting of a positive viral genome on emb tocilizumab an anti-il-6 receptor monoclonal antibody is now being tested in a multi-center randomized-controlled trial which recruits covid-19 patients with raised il-650 this might be beneficial in the setting of cytokine storm syndrome and help reduce myocardial inflammationmanaging arrhythmias is crucial in mitigating patients adverse health outcomes cardiac monitoring is advised to enable appropriate therapy for brady- and tachy-arrhythmias including atrioventricular block and ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation brady-arrhythmias may require temporary cardiac pacing and tachy-arrhythmias may respond to anti-arrhythmic drugs eg lidocaine and mexiletine and overdrive pacing some centers have commenced prescription of anti-malarials and macrolides which are known to prolong the qtc interval  caution must be taken with concomitant use of anti-arrhythmic drugs51
several potential pharmacological candidates are under investigation to repurpose for the use in covid-19 currently chloroquine is under a phase iib clinical trial to assess its efficacy in treating covid-19 patients with severe respiratory syndrome52 both chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine may cause qtc interval prolongation however their effects appear to be modest51 nevertheless hydroxychloroquine requires metabolism by the cyp3a4 enzyme53 whose inhibition might raise the drugs plasma concentration accentuating the long qt risk many pharmacological agents used empirically to treat covid-19 including ritonavirlopinavir and azithromycin are known cyp3a4 inhibitors hence their combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine should be accompanied by qtc interval monitoring51
as sars-cov-2 binds to the ace2 to gain host cell entry there is an ongoing debate of whether the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas antagonists should be used in the covid-19 patients some argued that the blockade might offer clinical benefit54 whilst others queried the possible upregulation of ace2 as a consequence of such blockades however according to the current clinical evidence the heart failure society of america american college of cardiology and aha advise continuing the raas antagonist regimen if prescribed for their approved indications even when the patient contracts covid-19 later55 both the aha and esc9

10 advised against the use of nsaids in myocarditis patients as they are the known cause of renal impairment and sodium retention which could exacerbate the acute ventricular dysfunction we summarize our recommendation regarding the diagnosis and management of sars-cov-2-related myocarditis in figure 4
several cases of coronavirus-related myocarditis have been reported its pathophysiology is likely a combination of the direct viral insult to cardiomyocytes and the humans immune response to virally infected myocardium simple bedside tests such as serial ecg and cardiac biomarkers can raise suspicion of acute-onset cardiac symptoms particular attention should be given to the biomarkers changes or trends and not just a reading in isolation cardiac imaging techniques such as echocardiography and cmr can be used to aid diagnosis however distinguishing between differentials of stress-induced cardiomyopathy sepsis-related cardiomyopathy and acute coronary syndrome can be difficult an invasive coronary angiogram will often be warranted especially in older patients the definitive diagnosis of myocarditis is obtained via emb and if performing an invasive catheterization adding an emb would add little time and no additional risk of infection spread vs catheterization alone for patients who cannot undergo cmr the contrast-enhanced cardiac ct is a swift reproducible precise and reliable alternative which can be added to the sequences for high-resolution ct of the lungs to evaluate the acute respiratory distress syndrome initial treatment for fulminant myocarditis should follow the cardiogenic shock protocol which includes the use of inotropes or vasopressors and mechanical ventilation arrhythmias can be managed by temporary cardiac pacing or anti-arrhythmic medications then depending on severity the patient may require mechanical circulatory support cautions must be taken for the use of the nsaids and qtc-prolonging drugs in covid-19 patients as these medications might exacerbate the cardiac symptomsrapid identification of infectious agents viruses bacteria and fungi is critical for the diagnosis and effective treatment of diseases the monitoring of biohazards in the environment and the detection of pathogens in foodstuffs are also crucial to protect human health various procedures have traditionally been used to collect isolate and identify pathogens from different specimens and samples in general culture methods using differential and selective media are employed for isolation and identification the identification is based on microscopic observation colonial morphology and phenotypic characteristics on isolation medium further biochemical serological and molecular biology methods are employed for the definitive identification of microbial isolates these established methods are often timeconsuming and laborintensive for instance cultivation on differential media and selective media might take days to weeks differentiation of clinical microorganisms to the species level might require as many as 20 biochemical tests consequently the need for alternative procedures that allow the rapid and reliable identification of microorganisms is increasing mass spectrometry ms is a powerful tool in biological research and represents an attractive alternative to classical biochemical methods especially for the accurate identification and classification of microbial species anhalt  fenselau 1975 cain lubman  weber 1994 fenselau  demirev 2001 lay 2001 demirev  fenselau 2008athere are challenges associated with identification of various types of pathogens from wide range of samples viruses are ultramicroscopic and they must be cultivated within a susceptible cell unlike bacterial proteomes viral proteomes are relatively small therefore available biomarkers might be limited the cell wall of grampositive bacteria is more difficult to disrupt than that of gramnegative bacteria because of the resistance of spores methods to identify them require germination and cultivation of the resulting vegetative cells microbiological analysis of a variety of samples generally requires specific approaches as a first step to isolate and culture the microorganisms liquid samples such as milk and body fluids might be directly cultured in media solid samples such as food are blended and diluted before culturing airborne pathogens should be sampled with an air sampler before further analysisthe applicability of ms to the analysis of complex biomolecules has been greatly improved by the introduction of two softionization techniqueselectrospray ionization esi and matrixassisted laser desorptionionization maldi ms these two softionization methods ionize large molecules with little or no fragmentation and therefore have been applied to analyze various biomolecules such as carbohydrates proteins and peptides dna and rna and synthetic polymers maldi and esi have both been effectively used for the accurate analysis of peptides and the determination of peptide sequences to identify and characterize proteins in microorganisms yao demirev  fenselau 2002 dworzanski et al 2004 these methods can be easily implemented in a straightforward diagnostic procedure to identify reliably the genus species and in some cases subspecies of bacteriamicrobial samples can be analyzed with ms by using a culture or a nonculture approach figure 1 presents an overview of msbased approaches to identify and characterize microorganisms in culture approaches potential biomarkers are analyzed directly with maldims or extracteddigested separated by chromatography and identified with ms in nonculture approaches cell enrichment with affinity methods is performed with physical chemical or biochemical interactions with target cells followed by ms analysis the coupling of air sampling and polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification to ms has also been developed to detect microorganisms finally unknown microorganisms are identified with a database search andor a computer algorithmmass spectrometry ms analysis of microorganisms present in complex biological samples obtained from food water and clinical specimens must often be preceded by purification and concentration affinity extraction can effectively clean up enrich and probe analytes of interest from complex biological mixtures nanostructures have many characteristics that favor their use as selective extraction agents and their small size makes them inherently effective as concentration agents the field of nanotechnology has seen explosive growth in recent years primarily because of the availability of new strategies for the synthesis of nanomaterials and new tools for characterization and manipulation curtis  wilkinson 2001 levy et al 2002 generally biological molecules such as proteinsenzymes antigensantibodies and dnaoligonucleotides have been immobilized on the surfaces of nanoparticles with supports of organicinorganic and polymer matrices exploiting the unique electronic optical and magnetic properties of nanomaterials bioconjugated nanomaterials provide a novel platform for the development of nanobiotechnology to identify microorganisms gu et al 2003a sample concentration techniques that are based on nanotechnology have potential applications to detect pathogens in complex samplesthe complexity of microbial biomarkers might be reduced with various chromatographybased methods however sample preparation and fractionation tend to slow down measurements efficient separation approaches should be considered to achieve a fast and highthroughput analysis various techniques such as liquid chromatography lc capillary electrophoresis ce twodimensional gel electrophoresis 2dge protein precipitation membranebased methods dialysis ultrafiltration supercritical fluid extraction and solidphase microextraction have been developed for sample pretreatment wang  hanash 2005 bodzonkulakowska et al 2007 this article focuses only on sample fractionation methods that are used to identify microorganisms ms analysis of various classes of biomolecules peptides proteins nucleic acids oligosaccharides and lipids with hyphenated ms techniques including gas chromatography gc ce and lc are described the direct analysis of pathogens with maldims has several advantages such as rapidity and simplicity this review also describes direct methods such as bioaerosol mass spectrometry bams and

the review will briefly describe recent progress in microbial analysis with desi dart and other techniques such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms and secondary ion mass spectrometry simsgenotypic methods such as pcr and nucleotide sequence analysis might be used as diagnostic tools to identify pathogens pcr methods are particularly promising because of their high specificity and sensitivity although pcr methods are quite useful to identify microbial species they cannot be used for classification especially when the microbial identities are unknown the combination of pcr and ms is an even more powerful tool for microbial identification in some cases it yields additional information that cannot be obtained from either technique alone sampath et al 2007b the esibased detection of pcr products and maldibased resequencing provide detailed genomic information that is useful in the rapid identification of microorganisms sauer  kliem 2010 lcesims has

and efficient online purification of dna fragments amplified by pcr because it can be fully automated with a high throughput oberacher et al 2000 berger et al 2002the utility of ms as an analytical tool for pathogens depends on the availability of a variety of ms methods and instruments that each provides particular pieces of information regarding the identity of the sample the complexity of the relevant experimental data has led to the development of many dedicated algorithms to extract and interpret useful information the review will also introduce methods of data analysis including library searches and statistical approaches to differentiate among pathogens and conclude with selected examples of applications of microbial analysis the review is intended to cover most current ms techniques of microbial analysis clearly although not all of the recently published literature will be referred to representative studies will be describedmicrobial biomarkers might be suppressed by the ions that are formed from complex matrices during ms analysis various affinity probes have been used to concentrate and purify the bacteria of interest fenselau and coworkers described the detection of bacteria from complex biological mixtures using affinity capture coupled with maldims they proposed an affinity method to trap traces of bacterial cells from complex biological mixtures with a lectinimmobilized substrate this technique offers a broad range with lessselective recovery because many bacteria have lectin on their cell surfaces bundy  fenselau 1999 bundy  fenselau 2001 afonso  fenselau 2003 recently affinity surfaces modified with immunoglobulin g igg or small peptides that were selected from phage libraries were used to isolate protein a from staphylococcus aureus the structure of protein a was identified with maldims johnson et al 2009 over the past decade a number of biomedical applications of magnetic micro and nanoparticles of various sizes shapes and compositions have emerged berry  curtis 2003 immunomagnetic separation has been widely used to reduce the detection timesuppression effect and to improve detection sensitivity magnetic particles conjugated with a specific antibody can selectively separate a target pathogen from complex samples ochoa  harrington 2005 voorhees et al proposed an approach that used affinitycapture techniques such as immunomagnetic separation to concentrate and isolate bacteria from complex sample solutions which was followed with a maldims analysis madonna et al 2001 madonna van cuyk  voorhees 2003a the method involved microsized magnetic beads immobilized with affinitypurified antibodies the immunocaptured bacterium was further infected with a bacteriophage a lytic virus phage amplification occurred within the living bacterial cell and induced cell lysis many phage progeny released into the sample medium and detection of the phage capsid proteins from the medium indicated the presence of the bacterium the detectable concentration was improved to 50  104 cellsml and the analysis could be finished within 2 hr because many antibodies and bacteriophages are commercially available the approach has the potential to analyze species or even strainspecific bacteria and to improve their detection limitthe rapid and sensitive detection of microorganisms at low concentrations is a challenging task functionalized magnetic nanoparticles very efficiently concentrate pathogens from large sample volumes into much smaller volumes a minimum capture efficiency of 94 for e coli o157h7 at concentrations from 16  101 to 72  107 colony forming unit cfuml with magnetic nanoparticleantie coli conjugates has been reported varshney et al 2005 various carbohydrates have been recognized as receptors for the attachment of pathogens to epithelial cells of e coli sharon 2006 for example mannoseencapsulated gold nanoparticles have been used to observe the specific binding to a fimh protein of bacterial type 1 pili e coli lin et al 2002 the covalent binding between nanoparticles and targets is easily achieved with the selfassembly of thiolated molecules on the nanoparticles thiolmetal interactions gu et al developed a strategy that used vancomycinconjugated fept nanoparticles to capture and detect pathogens such as vancomycinresistant enterococci and other grampositive bacteria or negative bacteria at exceptionally low concentrations gu et al 2003ab 2006 they used optical and scanning electron microscopy to observe the captured bacteria the thiolmetal binding protocol enabled the detection of bacteria from the samples within 1 hr and had a detection limit of 10 cfuml gu et al 2003aseveral research groups have investigated nanoparticles as extractionconcentration agents for coupling with ms figure 2 shows the experimental procedure for the selective extraction and concentration of microorganisms with functionalized magnetic nanoparticles followed by detection with maldims after functionalized magnetic nanoparticles are added to an eppendorf tube that contains microbial cells the suspension is incubated under gentle vortexing the magnetic nanoparticles interact with the pathogens and efficiently attach to them the nanoparticlemicrobial cell conjugates are isolated by magnetic separation and are deposited on a maldi target for ms analysis chens research group used functionalized nanoparticles to probe pathogenic bacteria chen tsai  chen 2008 they proposed a simple method to fabricate igg functionalized gold nanoparticles as useful probes of the electrostatic interactions between igg and pathogens ho et al 2004 the iggmodified magnetic nanoparticles which bind selectively to iggbinding sites on the cell walls of pathogens serve as affinity probes to capture targeted bacteria from sample solutions the optimal detectable cell concentration of bacteria in aqueous sample solutions staphylococcus saprophyticus and s aureus 05 ml and in urine samples s

pseudomonas aeruginosa liu et al 2009 from clinical urine samples through disaccharideprotein interactions they have been able to detect peptide signal from 250 l of samples at a concentration as low as 4  104 cellsml corresponding to 102 cells deposited on the maldi plate guo and coworkers utilized anionexchangecationexchange magnetic nanoparticles as affinity probes to separate bacteria from

water and reservoir water with a detection limit of 1  103 cfuml in 2 hr although most of the above affinity methods employ maldims for microbial analysis lcesims should be in principle as feasible as maldimsthe most important advantage of affinitybased nanotechnology is its ability to concentrate and purify microbial cells from complex samples such as urine microorganisms might be identified directly with maldims without microbial culturing direct maldi analysis of microorganisms in urine samples would be hindered by the high amounts of salts without the affinityenrichment step liu et al 2008 notably different cell counting methods are used among various labs and absolute cell number or cfu per volume are reported in literatures although cfu reflects the viable cell number absolute cell number is likely higher than those indicated by the cfu value limits of detection given in these two units should be compared carefullythe combination of ms with lc is one of the most important analytical methods to separate and identify a wide variety of biological samples banoub et al 2005 lcms is rapidly being developed as a tool in proteomics to deal with the inherent complexity of a biological system and to complement conventional approaches that are based on 2dge delahunty  yates 2005 furthermore lcms has greatly facilitated the determination of the molecular weights of proteins from complicated mixtures krishnamurthy et al 1999 used lcesims to identify protein biomarkers specific to individual organisms present in crude bacterial mixtures lyophilized intact bacterial cells were suspended in 01 aqueous tfa containing 020 acetonitrile to lyse the cells and release cellular proteins or metabolites specific to an individual microorganism biomarker proteins and peptides were separated with reversedphase hplc and a chromatogram of biomarker signals was used to distinguish bacteria however this work was limited by the complexity of the data generated from esi a solution to this problem was reported by williams and colleagues with an automated data handling algorithm that provided sequential scanning centroiding and deconvolution of multiply charged proteins present in successive scans of the lcms analysis williams leopold  musser 2002 this approach has proven useful for identifying protein biomarkers of vibrio parahaemolyticus williams et al 2004 the same group demonstrated a method in which lcms was used to identify unique proteins that can be sequenced identified and reverse engineered into pcr primers that are specific to a desired phenotypic trait thermal tolerance williams et al 2005 because the genome for enterobacter sakazakii was not sequenced by that time this methodology provided a unique independent means to identify genetic differences among closely related strains of this species without the need for any prior sequencing of the genome recently everley et al discovered reproducible intact protein biomarkers with an lcesims approach to differentiate and correctly identify unknown pathogens at the species everley et al 2008 and strain level everley et al 2009 the organism bacillus anthracis was identified with the msms analysis of an antigenic protein biomarker ea1 isolated with affinity chromatography and a monoclonal antibody krishnamurthy et al 2006 multidimensional protein identification has been used to identify b

btx and tetanus toxin ttx both belong to a family of potent bacterial neurotoxins and might be used as biological warfare agents van baar et al noted that protein toxins can be unambiguously identified with ms and they exploited this fact in analyses of tetanus van baar et al 2002b and botulinum van baar et al 2002a 2004 toxins lcmsms of selected precursor ions from trypsin digest

unknown sample to those in a proteome database has been developed as a useful tool for bacterial identification wang et al 2002 tao et al 2004 figure 3 schematically depicts a proteomic approach to identify microorganisms based on msms analysis microbial proteins are extracted from a cell lysate and digested the peptide digests are lcseparated and are analyzed with msms the msms spectra are checked against a proteome database to identify the proteins and to deduce the source of the microorganism demirev et al 1999 was the first to propose this method mathematical methods might be applied to evaluate the search results hu et al proposed a method that used lcselective proteotypic peptide analysis lcspa to identify the bacterial species in a complex mixture many pathogens were simultaneously identified from a series of selective msms analyses of marker peptides in the appropriate elution time windows for the specific peptides the sequest application was used to check all of the tandem mass spectra of the peptides against the ncbinr protein database this method successfully identified eight pathogens present in a microbial mixture lo hu  ho 2006 dworzanski et al 2004 developed a method to identify microorganisms or protein toxins based on the lcmsms analysis of peptides derived from bacterial proteins in their research production mass spectra of peptides that were generated from a microbial protein digest were checked against the prototype proteome database 87 bacterial genomes with sequest and the results of the search of the database were subjected to discriminant function analysis instead of matching peptide sequences to a microbial source in the database dworzanski et al 2006 employed multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis to determine the peptidesequence similarities between the unknown species and a database of bacteria grouped by their established taxonomic position they classified bacterial species into corresponding taxons based on similarities more recently the same group reported on the classificationidentification and genotyping of b anthracis b cereus and b thuringiensis strains based on the lcmsms analysis of wholecell protein digests dworzanski et al 2010lipid biomarkers have also been used extensively to characterize complex microorganisms from various environments with lcms or msms analysis jelinek et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 the collisioninduced dissociation of lipid biomarkers produces arrays of fragment ions that reveal structural information about bacteria moe et al 2005 similarly polar phospholipids can be used as a biomarker of bacterial presence mazzella et al 2004 separated and identified with lcms most of the phospholipid species phosphatidylglycerol phosphatidylinositol diphosphatidylglycerol and a unique lipid compound acyl phosphatidylglycerol of a grampositive bacterium corynebacterium species strain 8 the same group proposed fragmentation pathways and identified the diagnostic ions of two common bacterial phospholipid classes phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine they used lcms and msms methods to determine the structures of intact phospholipids from the two bacterial strains pseudomonas nautica ip 617 and marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus cultured on either ammonium acetate or crude oil mazzella et al 2005white et al have developed a rapid method to extract and detect the bacterial biomarker 26dipicolinic acid from gramnegative bacteria specific lipid components can also provide insights into the viability and potential infectivity of the pathogens detected in the samples white et al 2002 bacteriohopanoids or bacteriohopanepolyols bhps are good biomarkers for bacteria separation and identification many bacterial species are known to produce various bhps with specific modifications in the sidechain and ringstructure intact bhps have been directly detected from bacterial isolates with lcmsms talbot et al 2003ab talbot rohmer  farrimond 2007ab although lipid markers have been proven to be useful for microbial identification the dependence of lipid profiles on growth conditions might complicate identification resultscapillary electrophoresis allows the rapid and efficient separation of biological molecules with the least consumption of sample and reagents ce coupled to ms has been established as a method for the fast separation and identification of microorganisms kolch et al 2005 a limited number of articles have described the use of cems to identify microorganisms chong et al 2000 hu tsai  ho 2005 lo hu  ho 2006 hu et al 2007 petr et al 2009 hu et al applied cemsms to selected proteotypic peptide ions to obtain partial sequences of protein biomarkers proteotypic peptides refer to those experimentally observable peptides that identify specific proteins their proposed approach is a highly selective and sensitive analytical method to characterize the pathogens from microbial mixtures hu tsai  ho 2005 they performed a preliminary analysis with cemsms of the proteolytic digests of cell extracts from pure pathogens and carried out subsequent database searches to select abundant peptide ions that were specific to the pathogens of interest minor bacterial species present in the complex mixture at even 1 relative abundance were identified with high confidence they also applied this method to identify pathogens present in a saliva sample that had been spiked with bacterial mixtures further the speed of data analysis was greatly improved because only selected markers instead of wholeprotein digests were analyzed cemsms analysis of proteolytic digests of microbial cell extracts has been combined with sequest searching and a new empirical scoring system to identify bacterial species in microbial mixtures hu et al 2007 the search results for 19 samples of bacterial mixtures revealed that the empirical zscoring function improved the identification of bacteria in the mixtures petr et al 2009 combined ce separation with the offline ms identification of microorganisms they separated the model microorganisms e coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae and cultivated them after the fractions were collected after cultivation desims was used for further identificationmatrixassisted laser desorptionionizationmass spectrometry maldims allows the fast and accurate identification and subtyping of bacterial species seng et al 2009 stevenson drake  murray 2010 fungi marinachpatrice et al 2009 2010 santos et al 2010 and viruses swatkoski et al 2007 franco et al 2010 currently most published studies of the direct mass spectrometric analysis of microorganisms are based on maldi techniques demirev  fenselau 2008ab direct bacterial profiling with malditofms is based mainly on a comparison of specific mass spectra of the proteins peptides and other cellular components that are obtained from microbial cells one of the first studies using this approach was based on the protein profiles of microorganisms cain lubman  weber 1994 although sample preparation is crucial to maldi analysis of microbial markers there is no universal sample preparation and measurement protocol many methods have been described since the method for direct maldi analysis of bacteria was proposed the experimental parameters studied include cultivation conditions matrices solvents celllysis and matrixspotting methods microbial cells are generally obtained from a purified liquid culture or a single colony samples are analyzed by direct deposition of intact cells on the sample plate or using various ways of biomarker extraction the maldi matrices that most often used are cyano4hydroxycinnamic acid hcca ferulic acid fa and sinapinic acid sa hcca provides better signaltonoise ratio than fa and sa fa is suitable for the detection of highmass ions above 15 kda a uv laser is often used as an irradiation source irmaldi is rarely used to analyze microorganisms because of its somewhat lower sensitivity compared to uvmaldi although 5  103104 intact cells deposited on the maldi plate were sufficient to obtain useful biomarker signals the detected biomarkers were lowmass ions less than 1000 da it has been reported that 106 cells yielded the most goodquality and reproducible spectra for protein fingerprinting mazzeo et al 2006 current protein fingerprinting methods still require culturing of the microbial cells to obtain detectable signals analysis of nonculturable microorganism remains a challengerecent studies on maldi analysis of microorganisms have been focused on development of standardized analytical protocols vargha et al 2006 ilina et al 2009 and high throughput analysis of pathogenic bacteria donohue et al 2006 rajakaruna et al 2009 perhaps a universal protocol for sample preparation and analysis will not be obtained due to the complex nature of maldi experiments careful control of the sample preparation and measurement parameters is the key to the success of the fingerprinting approaches the maldims fingerprinting approach has been applied to analyze bacillus spores dickinson et al 2004 campylobacter mandrell et al 2005 salmonella leuschner beresfordjones  robinson 2004 aeromonas donohue et al 2006 clostridium grosseherrenthey et al 2008 streptococcus williamson et al 2008 nonfermenting bacteria pseudomonas cepacia mellmann et al 2008 staphylococcus rajakaruna et al 2009 neisseria ilina et al 2009 and helicobacter ilina et al 2010 the approach has such advantages as being able to detect intact biomarkers simplicity of sample preparation broadband identification and high throughputmatrixassisted laser desorptionionization maldi mass spectra might vary with growth media and growth stage valentine et al 2005 wunschel et al 2005 the intra and interlaboratory reproducibility of wholecell ms and the effect of culture media on the spectral profiles have been investigated walker et al 2002 williams et al 2003 discussed the experimental factors that affect the quality and reproducibility of bacterial analysis with malditofmsthe cell walls of grampositive bacteria are usually more difficult to analyze with maldims than those of gramnegative bacteria therefore analysis of grampositive bacteria yields spectra with fewer peaks lower intensities and a smaller mass range than the spectra of gramnegative bacteria several methods have been suggested to overcome these difficulties including disruption of the cell wall with enzymatic or chemical cleavage smole et al 2002 williams et al 2003 smole et al 2002 developed a method to prepare samples of wholecell grampositive bacteria for analysis they found that lysozyme treatment of grampositive bacteria increased the spectral range to levels close to those of gramnegative bacteria from the enterobacteriaceae family not only were intact cells analyzed but also four celllysis methodsmechanical enzymatic chemical and heat treatmentwere compared smole et al 2002 williams et al 2003 and optimized to increase the complexity of the biomarker profile to develop bacterial speciesspecific fingerprints vargha et al 2006 optimized the experimental parameters of malditofms analysis to differentiate among arthrobacter isolates at the strain level liu et al evaluated a universal samplepreparation protocol to analyze grampositive bacteria b anthracis and s aureus and gramnegative bacteria yersinia pestis e coli and b cepacia that have high extracellular polysaccharide contents in their study three samplepreparation methods direct analysis solvent treatment and enzyme treatment were tested for the direct analysis of bacteria with malditofms liu et al 2007
b anthracis is the etiological agent of anthrax in humansanimals and is recognized to be a potential biologicalthreat agent that could be used in biological warfare or by terrorists demirev  fenselau 2008b lasch et al 2009 numerous lowmolecularweight proteins can be readily extracted from the spores of b anthracis and related species many of these proteins have been identified as small acidsoluble spore proteins sasps with various solvents including 10 tfa 30 acetonitrile and 40 formic acid 50 acetic acid and acetonitrile5 tfa 7030 volvol hathout et al 2003 dickinson et al 2004 castanha et al 2007 fenselau et al 2007 whereas others have been identified as cyclic lipopeptides madonna et al 2003b coxiella burnetii the causative agent of q fever has been identified from its proteins extracted with acetonitrile and trichloroacetic acid hernychova et al 2008 and characterized with malditofmsseveral groups have focused on identifying fungal cells valentine et al 2002 and fungal spores li liu  chen 2000 chen  chen 2005 kemptner et al 2009ab with malditofms welham et al 2000 presented the first article on the use of malditofms with different matrices to characterize various fungal spores maldims has been used to desorb protein biomarkers from intact fungi and to generate highly reproducible mass spectra for penicillium species hettick et al 2008b 12 species of aspergillus and five strains of a flavus hettick et al 2008a these results indicate that malditofms data might be used to identify fungi unambiguously at the species and strain levels qian et al 2008 investigated malditof mass signatures for the accurate identification and differentiation of pathogenic candida species c albicans c glabrata c krusei c kefyr aspergillus species a terreus a fumigatus a syndowii and other yeast genera cryptococcus neoformans s cerevisiae and rhodotorula spp marinachpatrice et al 2009 identified 62 clinical fusarium isolates of nine fusarium species with partial tef1 gene sequencing and malditof analysis recently marklein et al 2009 demonstrated the identification of more than 250 clinical yeasts and yeastlike fungi candida cryptococcus saccharomyces trichosporon geotrichum pichia and blastoschizomyces spp with malditofms cyclic lipopeptides are potential biomarker molecules that can differentiate some microorganisms at the species and even at the subspecies levels jegorov et al 2006 price et al 2007the challenge in the above approach is that culture conditions and instrumental parameters can significantly influence the spectral reproducibility because of the complexity of mass spectral data many statistical algorithms have been developed to match acquired spectra to reference spectra or to generate fingerprints for microbial differentiation the linear correlation of analyzed spectra and library spectra has been performed to differentiate among protein profiles from bacillus spores dickinson et al 2004 a fingerprintselection algorithm that is similar to a statistical test of significance has been used to extract key biomarkers from spectra the constructed fingerprint library has been used to identify bacterial samples from three different laboratories wunschel et al 2005 keys et al 2004 compiled a maldi mass spectral database of over 100 genera and 350 species to characterize bacteria that are associated with human infectious diseases species or subspeciesspecific markers in the spectra were sometimes difficult to identify because the number of overlapping signals increased with the number of strains in the database many multivariate analytical mva techniques including pca cluster analysis and factor analysis have been applied to analyze the protein profiles of bacterial samples chen lu  harrington 2008 mva is based on multivariate statistics and involves the analysis of several statistical variables mz herein simultaneously parisi et al 2008 demonstrated the pca classification of two pathogens and the linear discriminant analysis of maldims spectra hsieh et al 2008 identified six human pathogens with cluster analysis and genetic algorithms ilina et al 2009 reported on the direct bacterial profiling of two human pathogens n meningitidis and n gonorrboeae cluster analysis successfully separated mass spectra of pathogenic and nonpathogenic neisseria isolates discussion of various mathematic methods used in data analysis has been described elsewhere ho  reddy 2010the topdown proteomics method identifies intact proteins without the need for prior proteolytic digestion of the sample the method has been used successfully for microbial proteomics in the analysis of bacillus spores demirev et al presented results obtained with a topdown proteomics approach that exploited malditoftofms of protein biomarkers to identify directly and rapidly individual bacillus spore species whether they are present alone or in a mixture demirev et al 2005 wynne et al 2009 a major advantage of this method is that the msms spectra of biomarkers are obtained without the need for biomarker prefractionation digestion separation or cleanup the maldi tandem mass spectra of intact biomarkers are fairly reproducible and library fingerprint matching of such tandem mass spectra can be exploited to identify intact microorganisms topdown proteomics has been applied to distinguish the pathogenic e coli strain from the nonpathogenic strain fagerquist et al 2010 figure 4 displays an msms spectrum of a protein marker at mz 77056 the protein was identified from its sequencespecific fragment ions by checking against a database of theoretical fragment ions derived from bacterial proteomes the protein sequences associated with the identified pathogenic strain and the nonpathogenic strain differ by only one amino acid 1 da the 1 da difference in protein mass would be difficult to detect with protein fingerprintingin bottomup proteomics proteins from lysed cells are cleaved to form peptides which are fragmented in a msms experiment the identification of peptides supports the identification of proteins which confirms the identification of microorganisms demirev feldman  lin 2004 fenselau et al 2007 russell edwards  fenselau 2007 the proteinpeptide identification approach overcomes the challenges of identifying components of mixtures of microorganisms warscheid  fenselau 2004 warscheid et al found that proteolytic digests are generated in situ from sasps to enable microorganisms to be identified with microsequencing and a database search english et al 2003 warscheid  fenselau 2003 warscheid et al 2003 sasps are reliable biomarkers for sporeforming microorganisms such as bacillus and clostridium species and allow the identification and differentiation of closely related species hathout et al 2003 warscheid  fenselau 2003 warscheid et al 2003 the same group obtained the complete sequences of the three mostabundant sasps from b globigii with ms they used a combination of msms chemical derivatization ladder sequencing and checking against a database to determine peptide sequences and to construct entire protein sequences whiteaker et al 2004 unfortunately several of the identified peptides are common to more than one species of bacillus and make difficult the determination of their origin warscheid  fenselau 2003 warscheid et al 2003 this difficulty applies particularly when closely related members of the cereus group b anthracis b cereus b mycoides and b thuringiensis are involved furthermore the determined major sasps of b globigii and b stearothermophilus are almost identical whiteaker et al 2004 focusing directly on the identification of speciesunique peptide sequences with maldims and msms analysis can help to achieve more rapid and automatable species differentiation pribil et al 2005 used the direct scanning of speciesunique sasp tryptic peptides and modified sasp extraction procedures to discriminate between b anthracis and b cereus with either ms or msms analysis in proteinpeptideidentification approaches spectral reproducibility is not critical as long as the observed spectra of the product ions are consistent with the proteinpeptides sequences in the database positive identification will be hindered if the protein database of the analyzed microorganism does not exist unless the proteinpeptide databases can be constructed from experimental data yao demirev  fenselau 2002currently proteins are the most used and accessible biomarkers for microbial identification because of their highabundances and generelated characteristics maldi analysis of biomarkers other than proteins has also been reported ishida et al applied an onprobe sample pretreatment protocol for the maldims measurement of phospholipids in growing bacterial colonies obtained directly from culture dishes they successfully observed a series of ions derived from phospholipids in gramnegative bacteria enterobacteriaceae family ishida et al 2002 however the spectra of grampositive bacteria did not include any lipidrelated peaks presumably because these bacteria have a thicker peptidoglycan layer therefore ishida et al 2005 developed a new method for the direct detection of phospholipids in grampositive bacteria b subtilis with maldims combined with onprobe sample pretreatment with trifluoroacetic acid as an additional reagent they also characterized the phospholipids in whole bacteria with solidsampling maldims ohtani  ishida 2007 with maldiftms jones et al 2003 investigated e coli lipids in the lowmass region mz 1001000 they identified two major components phosphatidyl ethanolamine and triglycerides that are generally found in prokaryotic membranes the same group described methods for the lipid analysis of s cerevisiae with conventional maldiftms jones et al 2004lipopolysaccharides lpss broadly known as endotoxins are essential components of the outer membrane of all gramnegative bacteria bacterial lpss are dimeric molecules that comprise a polysaccharide moiety linked to a lipid core termed lipid a which is anchored within the cell membrane therisod labas and caroff 2001 reported a method for the direct selective extraction and separation of lpss from bacterial cells with thinlayer chromatography followed by maldims analysis this method can be used for the direct ms analysis of heterogeneous lps and lipid a preparations e coli lipid a and bordetella lpss were used tirsoaga et al 2007 characterized the lipids a from three citrobacter and two bordetella strains with a procedure that involved direct extraction from cells followed by maldims this method is especially convenient when only small amounts of bacteria lps or lipid a are available schilling et al 2007 investigated lowabundance lipid a species from lps obtained from francisella tularensis f novicida and f philomiragia grown in vitro with a maldilinear iontrap mass spectrometerbioaerosol mass spectrometry bams has been used to identify bacteria spores and viruses without consuming any reagent fergenson et al 2004 adams et al 2008 russell 2009 the first attempt at specieslevel identification with reagentless bams was that of fergenson et al this technique has been used to distinguish aerosolized spores of b thuringiensis and b atrophaeus from a variety of background mixtures of powders soil and fungal spores by matching the mass spectra with fingerprints of pure samples fergenson et al 2004 a pulse laser at 226 nm was used to desorb and ionize chemicals from the aerosolized particles they demonstrated that chemical components of the two bacillus spore species were consistently and easily laser desorbed and detected in seconds furthermore bams has been applied to detect mycobacterium tuberculosis m smegmatis tobias et al 2005 and the biochemical and morphological changes of b atrophaeus cells during the sporulation process tobias et al 2006 although no sample preparation such as matrix addition was required the reagentless bams mass spectra of microbial cells were limited to signals under mz 300 lowmass biomarkers for b atrophaeus have also been identified with isotope incorporation and bams czerwieniec et al 2005 srivastava et al 2005stowers et al reported on the realtime and highmass detection of individual airborne pathogens with maldi aerosol tofms stowers et al 2000 van wuijckhuijse et al 2005 aerosol maldims can help detect highmass biomolecules and identify bacteria or other biological microparticles from their fingerprints in aerosol maldi the matrix is introduced via either condensation or deposition on a matrixcoated target noble  prather 2000 aerosol maldi differs from classical maldi in a number of important ways the differences include optimal laser fluence matrixtoanalyte molar ratio and choice of matrix and not just in the analytes mcjimpsey et al 2008 stowers et al described the analysis of biological aerosol particles with malditofms and applied this method to b subtilis spores they observed a single biomarker ion at ca mz 1225 that was attributed to a peptidoglycan stowers et al 2000 a new aerosol tofms instrument which is used with laserinduced fluorescence selection and maldi has been developed for the realtime analysis of single bioaerosol particles maldi ionization is triggered when fluorescent emission from microorganisms is observed the instrument can be used to measure the molecular masses of biomarker ions of bacteria and aerosolized proteinaceous materials up to 20 kda van wuijckhuijse et al 2005 in more recent studies kleefsman et al used singleparticle maldi to detect e coli kleefsman et al 2008 and erwinia herbicola cells kleefsman et al 2007 they stated that the instrument efficiency could be improved by the selective ionization of biological particles following the observation of singleparticle fluorescence stowers et al 2006 kleefsman et al 2007 although useful spectra of a few thousands of particles containing bacteria such as e herbicola have been obtained kleefsman et al 2007 improvements in detection limit are still required for the analysis of realworld samplessurfaceenhanced laser desorptionionization seldi a modified version of malditofms has been successfully used for biomarker discovery and protein fingerprinting of bacterial species barzaghi et al 2004 lancashire et al 2005 lundquist et al 2005 schmid et al 2005 al dahouk et al 2006 hutchens et al first described the original concept of seldi hutchens  yip 1992 hutchens et al 1992 seldims provided protein expression patterns from hundreds of samples in a single experiment thulasiraman et al 2000 diamond et al 2003 barzaghi et al 2004 it is an affinitybased ms method in which proteins are selectively adsorbed onto a chemically or biochemically modified surface seo kim and chai 2004 studied the proteinexpression profile in human macrophages that were infected by b anthracis spores with selditofms lundquist et al 2005 demonstrated that selditofms can generate unique and reproducible protein profiles for f tularensis subspecies to allow its subspecies to be distinguished from each other similarly seibold et al 2007 identified single strains of the subspecies f tularensis with seldims huang and coworkers proposed a method based on seldims to identify klebsiella pneumoniae and other related microorganisms by directly analyzing bacterial colonies without any protein extraction xiao et al 2009because seldi might yield many ion signals per bacterial sample computer algorithms used in maldi protein fingerprinting are also employed to identify useful biomarkers for bacterial identification seibold et al 2007 differentiated single strains within the subspecies f tularensis by combining selditofms with cluster analysis and pca the artificial neural network ann algorithm has been combined with seldims to identify n meningitides lancashire et al 2005 schmid et al 2005 and neisseria gonorrhoeae schmid et al 2005 schmid et al analyzed over 350 strains of n gonorrhoeae other neisseriae and closely related species such as kingella denitrificans and moraxella osloensis they performed comparative 16s rdna sequence analysis and standard biochemical tests to establish the identity of the strains prior to seldims analysis schmid et al 2005 ann is an algorithm for machine learning and represents a mathematical method that is not based on multivariate statistics in the ann method the relative abundances at all mz values are input to the input layer of the model the model is trained tested and validated with bacterial samples this approach has been applied to a blind dataset of 188 samples and correctly identified 184 out of 188 samples lancashire et al 2005 yates et al analyzed the volatile compounds of pathogens with quadrupole ms radialbasis function neural networks successfully identified the unknown bacterial samples yates et al 2005 seldims allows more selective analysis of protein profiles than does direct maldims useful markers might be selectively extracted and analyzed the surface capacity of a seldi probe plays an important role in the detection of markers the capacity depends on the number of interacting groups and even the size of the markers the markers that the seldi surface captures are usually the abundant ones possessing specific interacting functional groups further the ionization efficiencies of various molecules also determine the molecules detected in a mass spectrum in microbial analysis because seldi is generally used to obtain proteomic fingerprints from microbial samples the fingerprint data are useful as long as they are reproducible however just as for maldi analysis spectral reproducibility remains a key challenge in this approachambient mass spectrometric methods such as desi takats et al 2004 and dart cody laramee  durst 2005 have recently been applied to examine microbial samples with little or no sample preparation in an attempt accurately and rapidly to type closely related strains of bacteria dartms has been successfully applied to the analysis of fattyacid methyl ester profiles from bacterial cells pierce et al 2007 the ionization process involves an interaction between electronically excited atoms or vibronically excited molecules and the analytes that are obtained by the thermal hydrolysis and methylation of bacterial lipids takats et al used the desi method to identify microorganisms by spraying microbial samples with electrosprayed solvent droplets this technique has been used to differentiate among several bacteria species based on their desimass spectral profiles meetani et al 2007 song et al 2009 the bacteria include e coli s aureus enterococcus sp bordetella bronchiseptica b thuringiensis b subtilis and salmonella typhimurium highquality mass spectra have been obtained in positive and negativeion modes when whole bacteria were subjected to desi meetani et al 2007 the same approach has also been applied to the phospholipid profiling of intact bacteria song et al 2007 recently song et al 2009 applied desims to the analysis of untreated b subtilis in an in vivo experimentpyrolysis mass spectrometry pyms analyzes microorganisms from their pyrolysate fingerprint after decomposition of their biochemical components by heating to high temperature wilkes et al 2005 in curie point pyrolysis pure microbial cultures are dried in a suitable alloy foil and heated rapidly to the curie point of the foil the pyrolysates are immediately swept into a mass spectrometer and identified based on their mz ratio then the fingerprint or chemical profile of the pyrolysis mass spectrum is analyzed by suitable mathematic methods to differentiate pathogens the first automated curiepoint pyms was developed by meuzelaar et al specifically for fingerprinting complex nonvolatile biological samples such as bacteria meuzelaar  kistemaker 1973 meuzelaar et al 1976 the mass spectra of pyrolysates are usually complicated because many large biomolecules decompose into small fragments the cell envelopes of many bacteria have been analyzed and various separation methods such as hplc gc and thin layer chromatography have been developed for use with pyms so far however only pygcms has been commercially developed into a microbial identification system pygc and pygcms techniques allow for rapid volatilization separation and identification of pyrolysis products snyder et al 2004 sobeih baron  gonzalezrodriguez 2008 in pygc and pygcms highresolution gaschromatographic separation is carried out in a capillary column and mass spectrometric identification can be improved with either softionization methods or tandem ms sobeih baron  gonzalezrodriguez

miketova 2006a and other components such as dipicolinic or poly3hydroxyalkanoic acids have been utilized to differentiate bacteria goodacre et al 2000 detected the dipicolinic acid biomarker in 36 bacillus species with pyms an ionmobility spectrometer ims has been employed as a detector in the pygc analysis of bacteria in the onsite monitoring of transient plumes of aerosols that contain b subtilis snyder et al 2004 dworzanski et al 2005 reported on the use of the pygcims system to identify gramnegative pantoea agglomerans and grampositive b anthracis strain texas and b atrophaeus they identified pyridine2carboxamide 2picolinamide from the cell walls of grampositive bacteria they characterized the envelopes of gramnegative bacteria by the presence of a second membrane with the outer leaflet composed mainly of lps molecules anchored with a lipid a moiety these biomarkers include pyrolysis products of the 3hydroxymyristate fattyacid residues such as 1tridecene dodecanal and methylundecylketone the same group detected and classified deliberately released bioaerosols grampositive and negative bacteria in outdoorfield scenarios they identified 2pyridinecarboxamide in bacillus samples including b anthracis whose origin was traced to the peptidoglycan macromolecule in the cell wall pygcms analyses of gramnegative e coli revealed significant amounts of 3hydroxymyristic acid derivatives and degradation products snyder et al 2004 voorhees et al used highresolution pyms to identify different gramtype wholecell microorganisms twelve bacterial species were analyzed in triplicate grampositive bacteria b cereus b subtilis b anthracis e faecalis s epidermidis and s pyogenes were identified mainly by their carbohydrate biomarker peaks whereas gramnegative bacteria e aerogenes proteus mirabilis p aeruginosa serratia marcescens brucella neotomae and f tularensis yielded mainly lipidbiomarker peaks miketova et al 2003 in many of the studies referred to above multivariate statistics were used to analyze the pyrolysis mass spectra for instance pca has been applied to differentiate salmonella and vibrio species from their pyrolysis mass spectra wilkes et al 2006pyrolysis methods such as thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation thm in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide tmah ch34noh have been widely used in the direct analysis of fattyacid components of lipids in wholebacterial cells david tienpont  sandra 2008 cha et al 2009 recently phospholipids were directly identified on whole cells of e coli with thmgc in the presence of tmah and maldims with onprobe sample pretreatment without the need for any tedious sample preparation ishida et al 2006inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms has been used in the chemical characterization of trace and ultratrace elements in biological materials such as bacteria fungi and viruses zhang et al 2003 gikunju et al 2004 jackson ranville  neal 2005 li armstrong  houk 2005 beauchemin 2006 knowledge of the amounts of these trace elements and their speciation is important to understand the toxicological behavior of organisms icpms has several attractive features for trace element studies including rapid multielement analysis and very good detection limits of bacteria in suspension gikunju et al 2004 the detection and identification of b subtilis spores b subtilis vegetative cells and b thuringiensis with an inorganicchemical fingerprint obtained with direct injection icpms might be useful to detect biologicalwarfare agents gikunju et al 2004 this method reveals unique chemical signatures that reflect the processing history of each bacillus organismcliff et al demonstrated the use of tof secondaryion mass spectrometry sims to identify b subtilis spores that were grown in various media based on their elemental signatures the tofsims signatures consist of 16 elemental intensities cliff et al 2005 thompson et al used tofsims to distinguish between spores and vegetative bacterial cells of b megaterium the differentiation was based on the surfacelipid profiles thompson et al 2004nucleic acidbased techniques for microbial analysis rely on the genetic conservation within a species and genetic variability among species although conventional biochemical analysis remains an important method in clinical microbiology laboratories nucleic acidbased methods have become popular in diagnostic microbiology genotyping methods to analyze nucleic acids might involve hybridization primer extension ligation and cleavage or a combination thereof monis  giglio 2006 mothershed  whitney 2006 klouche  schroder 2008 the device to read out the measurements can be a gel reader a plate reader or an array reader among others maldims is considered to be an alternative tool to sequence dna however some technical problems such as adduct formation and limited sequence length have led to the use of ms primarily to analyze dna fragment profiles or single nucleotide polymorphisms snps esims can detect large and multiply charged pcr products mayr et al 2005 therefore accurate masses of the pcr products obtained with highresolution esims have been used to determine their base compositions ecker et al 2005 generally the mass spectra of nucleic acid products or their fragments are matched with theoretical ones in nucleic acid sequence databases to identify the species the advantage and disadvantages of genotyping methods have been reviewed elsewhere sobrino brion  carracedo 2005 pcramplification methods are able to detect a few tens of microbial cells and might be applied to the analysis of nonculturable microorganisms the major procedures for microbial analysis include cell lysis dna extraction amplification and pcrproduct analysis the sample workup time may be less than that for conventional culturing methods notably some procedures are laborintensive and the pcr techniques might require additional steps to remove potential inhibitors from samples the major advantage of using a mass spectrometer as a readout device in addition to the speed of analysis is its ability to measure masses of oligonucleotides the molecular mass that is directly related to the nucleotide composition is more accurate than other sequencerelated parameters such as migration timesbecause the 16 s rrna gene is universally distributed and highly conserved it has been widely used to differentiate microbial species restrictionfragment patterns are obtained from digestion of the pcr products with restriction enzymes the reduced size of the digested pcr products also favors ionization and mass analysis maldims has been successfully applied to differentiate microbial species by profiling the restriction digests of dna taranenko et al 2002 this method can detect hepatitis b and c viruses hbv and hcv in humanserum samples hong et al 2004 kim et al 2005 oh et al 2008 it has been used to analyze as few

identification is the resolution of length heterogeneities of marker genes among species von wintzingerode et al 2002 developed a method of microbial identification with the basespecific cleavage of pcr products amplification of 16s rdna marker sequences was followed by enzymemediated fragmentation at tspecific sites the basespecific cleavage yielded useful speciesspecific fragments and allowed differentiation of several cultured bordetella species and asyetuncultured bacteria another comparativesequencing method multilocus sequence typing mlst was used to analyze n meningitides by comparing the maldi spectra of mlst loci to reference sequences in the public mlst database honisch et al 2007 this method is based on pcr of several housekeeping genes the variations in the sequences of multiple loci that are derived from basespecific rna cleavage support the identification of pathogensthe homogeneous basespecific cleavage of pcramplified and transcribed 16s rrna gene was analyzed with maldims to identify mycobacteria at the species level lefmann et al 2004 the maldims analysis of rna is superior to that of dna because rna that is transcribed from dna is more stable the 2 oh group on the sugar ring reduces nglycosylic bond fragmentation tang zhu  smith 1997 tost  gut 2006single nucleotide polymorphisms snps represent single base changes that occur at a specific position in a genome the maldi mass spectra obtained from eight snps in the precorebasal core promoter of hbv were used to differentiate wildtype and mutant samples lau et al 2007 the pcr extension of primers that were designed to be annealed at the polymorphic site yielded distinguishable genotypespecific snps even though their mass differences were in a narrow range of 924 da an snp within the fumc gene

genotype hcv from hcvpositive blood sera or plasma they designed three oligonucleotide primers to detect two sets of genotypespecific snps the proposed method was an accurate and efficient method for hcv genotyping based on minisequencing although the occurrence of novel mutations limits the use of genotypic methods based on single nucleotide differences between strains genotypic assays with basespecific cleavage strategies detect new strainsa method called triangulation identification for the genetic evaluation of risks tiger to analyze microbial mixtures has been proposed ecker et al

and the enterobacteriaceae family baldwin et al 2009 were successfully identified with this approach it uses highresolution esifticrtof ms to analyze multiple pcr products to allow the base compositions a t g and c base counts obtained from multiple primer pairs to be accurately deduced figure 5 shows the process the first step involves extraction of all nucleic acids that are present in a sample aliquots of the nucleicacid solution are amplified with various primers the pcr primers target universally distributed and highly conserved regions of microbial genes such as 16s and 23s dna the second step is to use ms to measure accurately the masses of the pcr products in a size range of around 100 bp and a mass of ca 30 kda these base compositions are employed to triangulate the identities of most pathogens additional primers that are targeted to variable regions of specific microbial genomes are used in the highresolution genotyping of specific species to deduce the base compositions based on the mass of pcr products use of mass spectrometers with high mass accuracy is a mustthis pcresims approach has also been used to detect and type the strains of s aureus isolates

for accurate microbial identification as mentioned above each method has its strength and weaknesses maldims is a rapid sensitive simple method therefore it is very suitable for direct biomarker profiling of microorganisms however experimental parameters should be carefully controlled to obtain reproducible spectra maldimsms topdown or bottomup approaches might avoid the reproducibility problems by analyzing sequence information of specific biomarkers lc cemsms separates and analyzes biomarkers such as proteins or peptides belonging to a microorganism and provides accuracy and selectivity although the speed of analysis is reduced microbial mixtures can be analyzed without culture isolation pcrms provides the best detection limit and might indentify nonculturable

coronavirus and the h1n1 flu outbreak that was caused by a novel influenza a virus as well as some biothreat incidents reveal the importance to develop more rapid sensitive and accurate realtime detection methods ms has been successfully applied to the analysis of biomarkers from microbial samples many advanced methods for microbial analysis have been proposed the maldims fingerprinting of microorganisms has a number of advantages including rapidity and ease of implementation construction of a large reference spectral library and the use of a fingerprintselection algorithm are critical to the success of the fingerprinting approach because of the complexity and the lack of reproducibility of microbial mass spectra obtained from realworld samples identification of microorganisms through the sequence analysis of peptide or proteins markers might solve the problems associated with spectral reproducibility topdown or bottomup protein identification methods can be used to analyze sequence information although the proteomic methods are limited by the number of available proteome databases more and more microbial proteomes have been revealed and should broaden the applicability of these approaches in microbial analysis topdown methods directly characterize proteins and are therefore quick and simple in bottomup approaches the complexity of microbial biomarkers might be simplified with various chromatographybased methods although separation processes reduce the speed of identification they provide significantly improved accuracy and selectivity furthermore because the dynamic range is also increased even a small amount of microorganisms in complex sample matrices can be identified most current microbial analysis methods require the culturing of the target cells to obtain detectable signals the culturing time is by far the ratelimiting step in rapid microbial identification reducing the detection threshold for microbial cells will be one of the major challenges in the future methods and instrumentation must both be improved to reach this goal cell enrichment through affinity techniques will also be important selective biomarker analysis with multiple reaction monitoring approaches coupled with affinity techniques will enhance the sensitivity and accuracy of microbial identification the ms detection of pcr products from microbial genes might be an alternative means to improve the detection limit especially in analyses of nonculturable microorganisms advances in ms instrumentation and methods shall support a simple and accurate means of pathogen identification for environmental monitoring and clinical diagnosis

at the time of this writing april 7 2020 more than 12 million people worldwide are infected and more than 68000 have died because of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 induced by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and this figure will surely multiply in the next few weeks according to dr anthony fauci head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace-2 a type i transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase as its preferred entry receptor the expression of ace-2 is high in alveolar and epithelial tissues in the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract drugs which affect the expression of ace-2 such as ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are being investigated as possible risk factors for the severity of coronavirus disease 20191 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are being similarly investigated2 clinical trials with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine3 antiretroviral drugs4 and antiinterleukin-65 are ongoing in an attempt to improve disease outcomes before a vaccine can be available this provides a glimpse of the complexities of this disease and reveals the importance of identifying candidate drugs for clinical trials that may save lives it follows in importance to identify patients with allergy who are at risk if treated and who may need desensitization understanding the mechanisms of drug allergy6 is key given that the classification of drug hypersensitivity continues to expand7 cytokine stormlike reactions with elevated interleukin-6 can be seen in patients treated with chemotherapy and monoclonal antibodies8 and are now part of a broader definition of anaphylaxis allowing for better management and treatment optionsthe timing of this issue of the annals is highly relevant given that it is dedicated to broadening our understanding of the scope of drug allergy in the general population various tools can be used in personalized medicine to confirm or refute specific drug allergy status through delabeling these standardized diagnostic interventions can allow both children and adults to safely take the drug for which they had been previously labeled as allergic thereby resulting in the removal of this label the topics covered in this issue provide the necessary and updated knowledge for all allergists involved in labeling and delabeling procedures aiming to broaden drug choices and treatment options for patients in this unknown world of covid-19 pandemic and other disease statesour first question is who is labeled as drug allergic in the general population and what can be done to uncover true drug allergy a review by macy9 provides data on a large cohort of more than 2 million members of kaiser health care with 20 reported to have a drug allergy and more than 13 having antibiotic allergy in this drug allergy cohort twice as many patients are females age of more than 50 years and increased body mass index were found to be associated with drug allergy the review also discusses whether drug allergy and hypersensitivity are due to increased use given that countries with lower rates of antibiotic use have a lower prevalence of antibiotic allergy inappropriate use of antibiotics is still high in the setting of dental procedures target populations for receiving a drug allergy label include the following 1 children with approximately 70000 visits to the emergency department reported annually for adverse drug events with penicillins cephalosporins and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim as the most frequent medications and 2 hospitalized patients with cancer of whom 23 have a label of antibiotic allergy what are the tools for the labeling or delabeling of a drug allergy for individuals with penicillin-associated anaphylaxis penicillin skin testing with penicilloyl-polylysine before oral amoxicillin 250 mg oral challenge if skin test negative is the avenue proposed by the author however with the lack of minor determinants sensitization is not addressed for patients with a history of benign cutaneous reactions 1 single oral dose of amoxicillin is recommendedwhat are the benefits and dangers of a drug allergy label in a review by solenki10 the author reviewed self-reported penicillin allergy which accounts for at least 10 of the population and observed that among these individuals claiming to be allergic to penicillin more than 90 are not truly allergic and can tolerate penicillin these discrepancies were reviewed which included initial mislabeling at the time of the clinical event such as associated symptoms of viral infections including urticaria and gastrointestinal adverse effects of antibiotics many drug allergies are not long-lived and the natural resolution of penicillin allergy was reviewed the author validated current diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of penicillin cephalosporins and other antibiotics allergies multicentered clinical trials are needed to validate skin testing predictive values and to assess the value of new tools such as specific immunoglobulin e and basophil activation testhow to detect children with true penicillin allergy vyles et al11 provide a review that describes that most allergies in pediatric patients are self-reported and often clinically inconsistent with true allergy the rate of parent-reported adverse drug reactions ranges from 6 to 10 and most of these so-called allergic reactions are attributed to beta-lactam antibiotic derivatives anti-inflammatory drugs and other antibiotics nonimmediate rashes occurring after several days of treatment are the most frequently reported symptoms although skin testing followed by oral challenge is the safest way to identify true immunoglobulin mediated allergy in children with high-risk allergy symptoms risk stratification and direct oral challenge of low-risk patients is becoming a standard of interest are 2 studies which reported that both parents and physicians were reluctant to utilize penicillin class antibiotics after the penicillin allergy label was removed because of fear of an allergic reaction the authors concluded that current and future efforts should focus on preventing penicillin allergy labels that can carry over into adulthood providing education and decision support in the electronic medical record and testing low-risk drug administration strategies in low-risk patients integrating penicillin allergy management into stewardship efforts with the government and third-party payer incentives should be the long-term goal for penicillin allergy delabeling at the population levelwhat is the current understanding of drug hypersensitivity and allergic reactions jakubovic et al12 provide a broad and updated review of the current knowledge by reviewing the classical model of drug hypersensitivity reactions and comparing this with the current and more customized classification based on phenotypes endotypes and biomarker profiles this approach allows for the classification of reactions to chemotherapy drugs monoclonal antibodies and new small molecules complementing the gell and coombs classification drug allergy phenotypes allows for the description of classical and atypical clinical symptoms such as cytokine stormlike manifestations in the context of drug exposure timing and severity the endotypes look at the mechanisms and also the molecular and cellular targets whereas biomarkers are used as diagnostic tools biomarkers such as skin testing tryptase and basophil activation test provide the signature for the different endotypes as more mechanisms of drug allergy are uncovered and new biomarkers become available they can be incorporated into this flexible classification guiding clinicians toward an optimal approach for patient labeling or delabeling treatment and managementwhat is the evidence for and how can recommendations be made for labeling and delabeling are there models for these recommendations shaker et al13 on behalf of the joint task force for allergy practice parameters jtfpp provided a review of the recommendations for anaphylaxis treatment the authors introduced grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation grade a new method of evidence appraisal and translation which has emerged as a leading approach to anaphylaxis guidelines development grade creates explicit processes for evaluating the broad evidence based on a specific structured and answerable clinical question randomized controlled trials begin the evaluation process as high certainty whereas observational studies begin as low certainty evidence may be downgraded depending on the following considerations 1 the risk of bias 2 imprecision 3 inconsistency 4 indirectness and 5 publication bias through this methodology evidence and certainty are clearly and simply described as very low low moderate or high the jtfpp has been producing grade guidelines since 2017 and the 2020 jtfpp anaphylaxis grade is focused on the practice of anaphylaxis prevention through identification and mitigation of risk factors for biphasic anaphylaxis and evaluation of the use of supplemental glucocorticoid andor antihistamine premedication for immunotherapy radiocontrast media and chemotherapy in contrast to grade good practice statements include the administration of epinephrine as first-line treatment for uniphasic andor biphasic anaphylaxis a good practice statement may be used when there is a high certainty that a recommendation will be more beneficial than harmful though there is little direct evidence grade is prescriptive explicit and transparent and requires expert judgment and consensus of guideline groups as evidence is evaluated and translated into recommendationswhat is the practical approach to drug allergy labeling and delabeling louisias and wickner14 provided a review on the playground and available tools for drug allergy delabeling the authors indicated that large-scale drug allergy delabeling is influenced by multiple factors such as changing cultural moors easily adapted tools to delabel and electronic health record ehr crosstalk current functionalities of ehrs drug allergy sections are often at odds with providing reliable updated expert safe and affordable care they reported that up to 35 of patients had at least 1 drug allergy listed in their ehr and many had up to 20 nobody removed duplicates or delabel drugs with nonallergic symptoms the authors indicated the need to uncover the integral components of drug allergy delabeling programs that can be tailored and disseminated incentivized by insurance companies and hospitals and standardized nationally one study estimated penicillin allergy delabeling programs could have cost savings of 192223 per year in tertiary care center pediatric emergency departments thus underscoring the economic incentives of delabelingallergists need to challenge every drug allergy label and to recognize drug allergy and hypersensitivity symptoms using the new framework of phenotypes and endotypes supported by biomarkers providing risk stratification is key to safe delabeling procedures and to help provide management options including desensitization to patients who are truly allergic minimizing inappropriate use recording accurate intolerances delabeling whenever possible and adhering to essential elements of effective stewardship will solve the antibiotic allergy epidemicin the early months of 2020 covid-19 has rapidly spread around the world1 2 at the time of writing italy represents the third country by higher incidence and the second by mortality13 the public health crisis precipitated in the darkest days of early march when the italian government in the figure of the prime minister locked down the country people were forced to remain at home most activities were blocked including academic teaching and research4 accordingly all elective medical procedures scheduled as non-urgent were postponed conversely it was widely held that the activities directly related to prolong life expectancy of oncological patients must not be delayed predictive molecular testing to select potential responsive oncological patients for targeted treatment certainly falls into this categorythe predictive molecular pathology laboratory at the university of naples federico ii is serving several nearby institutions during the covid-19 outbreak the laboratory kept performing predictive molecular testing on tumour tissue specimens58 however laboratory organisation needed to be completely reshaped to limit personnel number and working hours before the covid-19 outbreak our laboratory adopted in most cases laboratory-developed tests ldts5 6 912 special care had been taken to simplify laboratory workflows as an example tissue samples from lung colon cancer melanoma and gastrointestinal tumours gist were batched and all processed by next-generation sequencing ngs using the custom sire gene panel6 9 ngs technology is fascinating and our sire assay has recently been adopted by several institutions along the italian peninsula13 however ngs requires significant hands-on time and in some steps laboratory staff need to work closely in this current health emergency however safety issues are crucial the number of individuals in laboratory space and physical interactions should be minimised as much as possible and the protocols should take into account at least the 1 m distance rule to respect these indications in our laboratory a paradigm shift towards simple and fast automated testing platforms was deemed to be not only necessary but also cost-effectivein the times of coronavirus disease predictive molecular testing for oncological patients is more challenging than usual cost-effective and technologically advanced laboratory organisation strategies should be balanced with the need to limit virus transmission here this study aimed to report and to critically analyse the evolving scenario to this end all clinical reports issued from 9 march to 20 april 2020 were reviewed the number of patients referred from oncologists the number of sample patients evaluated for each biomarker the testing methodologies adopted the laboratory staff composition and their working hours the reagent costs and the turnaround time tat from sample to results were taken into account in particular tat was considered the time between the receipt of samples to clinical reporting to monitor the impact of covid-19 on our activity data were compared with those relative to the same period 9 march to 20 april in 2019written informed consent was obtained from all patients and documented in accordance with the general authorisation to process personal data for scientific research purposes from the italian data protection authority httpwwwgaranteprivacyitwebguesthomedocweb-docwebdisplayexport2485392before the covid-19 outbreak the laboratory staff was composed by five units of personnel with interchangeable skills fp mr cdl ai and um each employee worked full time 35 hours a week the laboratory director um as a delegate of the head of the department gt was responsible of the overall organisation and administration of the laboratory planning the workload for each employee and organising the staff rotation to harmonise responsibilities and to obtain an adequate tatin table 1 for both periods of time the patient and

were evaluated together with immunohistochemical ihc assessment of gene fusions proteins including anaplastic lymphoma kinase alk and ros proto-oncogene 1 receptor tyrosine kinase ros1 in addition programmed death-ligand 1 pd-l1 ihc was also part of our diagnostic routine patients with gists were evaluated for platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha pdgfra and kit proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase kit mutations while melanoma cases were evaluated for braf and nras alterationsa number of different genotyping technologies have been validated in our laboratory to ensure a versatile

hotspot clinical relevant mutations in six genes egfr kras nras braf kit and pdgfra6 9 the analysis for msi an agnostic biomarker for different tumour types is usually carried out by using a pcr-based bethesda panel combined with a microfluidic platform tape station 4200 agilent technologies santa clara california usa analysis10 only in selected cases when biomarker assessment is urgently required in acute deteriorating patients the fully automated real-time pcr rt-pcr platform idylla biocartis mechelen belgium is preferred11 12 finally ihc analysis were carried out to evaluate alk gene fusions by using d5f3 ventana roche diagnostics basel switzerland and ros1 gene rearrangements by using d4d6 clone cell signalling technology leiden the netherlands in addition pd-l1 expression analysis in patients with advanced-stage lung cancer by ventana pd-l1 sp263 assay on benchmark xt roche diagnostic was also carried out5
during the covid-19 outbreak the laboratory director following the head of department recommendations to limit as much as possible the time spent by each employee in the hospital organised a rotation involving the three biotechnologist units fp mr and cdl to ensure that the genotyping assays for the assessment of ras egfr braf kit pdgfra and msi status would be carried out a pathologist assistant ai ensured the histological processing of the tissue samples ai was the bridge between the pathologists cb and ev assessing cellular content and the predictive molecular pathology laboratory overall biotechnologists fp mr and cdl were organised to follow a weekly rotation while the assistant pathologist ai was asked to attend the lab on alternate days um kept working full time to supervise the activities to ensure the reagent supply and to interpret and report resultsthe number of patients undergoing biomarker testing in 2020 45 was similar to that of the same period of 2019 43 the patient and sample characteristics are reported in table 1 molecular analysis was successfully carried out in 42 977 out of 43 samples and 41 911 out of 45 samples for the 2019 and 2020 group respectively the adopted molecular platforms differed figure 1 the vast majority of cases in 2019 were analysed by ngs 3242 762 followed by idylla 442 95 ngs plus tape station 342 71 tape station alone 242 48 and conventional rt-pcr 142 24 during the outbreak to allow laboratory staff rotation the genotyping laboratory workflow was completely reshaped and the fully automated platform was prioritised to minimise biotechnologist hand-on times thus in 2020 almost all cases were analysed by idylla 3841 927 and the remaining cases were analysed by ngs 341 73 the results in terms of type and frequency of detected alterations relative to assays performed are reported in online supplementary table 1 as far as predictive ihc is concerned no differences were reported in the methodological approach between the two periods and the relative results are reported in online supplementary table 1the mean tat from the receipt of suitable samples by our laboratory to reporting the results to the clinical care team was 79 working days ranging from 3 to 22 in 2019 while it was shorter in 2020 53 days ranging from 1 to 12 figure 1 regarding the average reagent costs ngs required 98 to cover all the reagent cost necessary for nucleic acid extraction gene panel library preparation and sequencing for each patient the reagent costs for the idylla platform ranged from 95 to 136 for single geneassay evaluationduring the covid-19 outbreak in our laboratory oncological patients have timely been tested for targeted treatments in addition actions were needed to ensure laboratory staff safety to accomplish these results laboratory organisation had to be deeply reshaped14 thus the covid-19 emergency is also changing the way we practise predictive molecular pathology since this activity is crucial to extend and improve the life expectancy and quality of oncological patients it is not surprising that the molecular testing volume was steady in contrast to our recent report showing a reduced number of samples in anatomical pathology laboratories15
fully automated technologies are advancing at a rapid pace16 in normal times this technology has usually been considered as second class to be segregated in small laboratories featuring limited workload and lacking skilled and trained staff17 in larger and academic institutions as previously reported this technology was considered only when acute deteriorating patients needed urgent treatment or when nucleic acid quality was unsuitable for ngs18 however in the time of covid-19 ldts based on several sequential steps and requiring long hands on time are more difficult to be carried out fully automated technologies can be prioritised to ensure accurate biomarker evaluation and sustainable laboratory activity indeed we should rethink and re-evaluate the value originally assigned to each laboratory staff working hour being aware that the time spent by a biotechnologist in the laboratory is today more precious than before11 12 in fact it should be borne in mind that a critical attitude is required to interpret and validate the results in our experience the possibility for a highly trained molecular pathologist to visually inspect the rt-pcr curves online thanks the web-based idylla explore application is crucial19 in fact although most cases 95 were diagnosed by the fully automated approach only on some occasions ngs was still carried out to refine uncertain results displaying rt-pcr curves of undetermined interpretation20 moreover not all clinically relevant biomarkers are testable by idylla as an example automated assays for kit and pdgfra gene evaluations have not been developed yet on the other sides the disadvantage of the fully automated approach is the higher overall cost for a single patient21 in fact the cost of a comprehensive analysis for a patient with crc kras nras braf and msi with idylla is around 350 with respect to 98 of our sire ngs panel this latter offers also the possibility to simultaneously assess a larger number of clinically relevant biomarkers from the same sample22 this is a crucial point in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer where retrospective data can be mined to integrate the egfr analysis with information on braf and kras status23 although is not considered a must-test gene yet kras is acquiring greater relevance considering the amg510 amgen thousand oaks california usa clinical trials underlining the role of exon 2 pg12c point mutation as a positive predictive biomarker24
the need to maintain physical distance between laboratory staff is well established25 26 conversely since molecular testing is based on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue or on ethanol-fixed cytological material the possibility that the virus would be present in the examined tissue samples is minimal27 conversely liquid biopsy may represent a potential source of transmission and recommendations to regulate this activity should be provided soonin conclusion the covid-19 outbreak underlines even more the concept that predictive molecular pathology should be practised in advanced laboratories by highly trained staff in fact even a fully automated procedure needs to be used in the proper scenario making the versatility of testing technologies a crucial opportunity for

capital city of hubei province china these cases were epidemiologically linked to a local huanan wholesale seafood market 12 a previously unknown betacoronavirus was discovered through unbiased sequencing in samples from patients with pneumonia human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate a novel enveloped rna betacoronavirus named 2019-ncov and later renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 formed a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus orthocoronavirinae subfamily 1 phylogenetic analysis showed that sars-cov-2 has 89 genome sequence identity to a bat sars-like coronavirus 80 identity to sars and 50 identity to mers coronavirus thus making sars-cov-2 the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans as well as the third coronavirus with bat origins 4since its initial identification the disease caused by sars-cov-2 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has spread to more than 187 countries worldwide over the past few months 5 given the rapid spread of this virus with consequences on an international scale covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization on march 11 2020 6 as of may 10 2020 more than four million covid-19 cases were reported globally including more than 13 million cases in the united states which are associated with more than 281000 deaths to date 5 although sars-cov-2 appears to have a lower fatality rate than either sars-cov or mers-cov covid-19 has resulted in many more deaths than both of these prior outbreaks combined partly because of its greater infectivity estimated reproductive number r0 of between 2 and 3 and higher attack rate thus leading to more infected patients 6 evidence of person to person transmission has been observed primarily through close contact and respiratory droplets the virus can be detected one to two days before symptom onset in upper respiratory samples and the median incubation period has been estimated to be 51 days 95 confidence interval ci 45-58 days 7 although most symptomatic patients with covid-19 present with fever dry cough and shortness of breath and show pneumonia on imaging findings approximately of ten percent of patients have a worsening of the disease thus requiring intensive care and possible complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards viremia acute cardiac injury disseminated intravascular coagulation dic multi-organ failure and subsequent death in critically ill patients 8definition of acute myocardial injurymyocardial injury is defined as an elevation in cardiac biomarkers cardiac troponin i tni or troponin t tnt above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit and is considered acute if there is a rise andor fall in cardiac troponin concentrations exceeding the biological andor analytical variation myocardial injury may be secondary to ischemic or nonischemic processes 910 traditionally elevated troponin concentrations have been considered equivalent to myocardial infarction however with improvements in troponin assays elevated levels without overt symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia are now more common hence the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction considers myocardial injury to be a separate unique entity 11 based on current evidence a myocardial injury without overt ischemia represents approximately 60 of cases of abnormal troponin elevation 9 the differential diagnosis is broad in such cases it can be recognized in the variety of cardiac such as acute heart failure pulmonary embolism myocarditis cardiac surgery or procedures cardiac arrhythmias hypertension stress-induced cardiomyopathy or several non-cardiac conditions such as acute renal failure sepsis anemia hypoxia critical illness drug-induced rhabdomyolysis among others 910 association of viral infections with myocardial injury has been well recognized and the most common associations involve adenoviruses and enteroviruses such as coxsackie viruses 12 according to data from previous influenza virus and coronavirus epidemics these viral infections have also been shown to cause myocardial injury because cases of myocarditis have been described to be caused by both influenza and coronaviruses 1314although sars-cov-2 infection predominantly causes pulmonary complications such as pneumonia and ards the disease has also been associated with a variety of cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury myocarditis arrhythmia heart failure and venous thromboembolism 6 moreover studies have shown that patients with covid-19 and preexisting cardiovascular disease cvd have an increased risk of acquiring the illness and subsequently having severe disease and death 67 in a clinical bulletin issued by the american college of cardiology acc the overall case-fatality rate was 23 but the mortality reached 105 in patients with underlying cvd 15 among various cardiac complications acute cardiac injury with elevated cardiac biomarkers has been described in early studies from china on hospitalized patients with covid-19 we discuss the prevalence mechanism clinical characteristics management and prognostic implications of sars-cov-2-induced myocardial injury according to current published researchcardiovascular complications with sars-cov and merssars-cov and mers may also result in cardiovascular complications although most of the data are anecdotal in the absence of systematic studies although sars-cov infection is associated with some cardiovascular manifestations there are no clear reported cases of myocarditis 16-19 however in the 2012 saudi arabia outbreak mers-cov was reported to cause acute myocarditis and heart failure table 1 14prevalence of myocardial injury in covid-19acute cardiac injury has been reported to be highly prevalent in hospitalized patients with covid-19 table 2the earliest single-center retrospective study conducted in china involving 41 hospitalized patients with covid-19 detected acute cardiac injury in five 12 patients in the study a diagnosis of acute cardiac injury was made if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers troponin i were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit or new abnormalities were detected in electrocardiography ecg and echocardiography 1 since then numerous retrospective studies reported an increased prevalence of myocardial injury in hospitalized patients with covid-19 with a frequency between 5 and 28 120-25 the prevalence of cardiac injury increased with the severity of the disease table 3 26-31however data regarding troponin elevation in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic non-hospitalized patients are not availablemechanism of cardiac injury in covid-19the mechanism of cardiac injury among patients with covid-19 remains uncertain the following potential mechanisms have been suggested1 sars-cov-2 induced direct myocardial injuryone potential mechanism is direct myocardial involvement mediated via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 832 the betacoronaviruses can infect human hosts through ace2 a membrane-bound protein expressed in many human cells including vascular endothelia renal tissue cardiovascular tissue and small intestinal epithelia ace2 negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin system by inactivating angiotensin ii and it is likely to protect against acute lung failure a murine model has demonstrated that pulmonary infection with sars-cov also precipitates ace2dependent myocardial infarction among humans during the toronto sars outbreak sars-cov viral rna was detected in 35 of autopsied hearts thus raising the possibility of direct damage of cardiomyocytes by the virus 32 phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that sars-cov-2 has a very similar receptor binding domainmotif to that of the sars coronavirus thus suggesting that sars-cov-2 may use ace2 as a receptor to enter human cells and causes direct damage to the lung epithelia thereby leading to pneumonia and ards because ace2 is also highly expressed in the heart covid-19 induced cardiac injury might potentially be mediated by ace2 although whether sars-cov-2 binding alters ace2 expression or causes dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas pathway remains unclear 673233 hence one potential explanation for the higher likelihood of acquiring infection and the increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in patients with covid-19 with pre-existing cvd maybe the elevated secretion of ace2 in these patients thus making them more susceptible to direct viral damage to cardiac myocytes 33 but this has not yet been demonstrated in pathology studies in a case report describing autopsy results for a 50-year-old man who died of covid-19 associated with ards histologic examination of biopsied cardiac tissue showed rare interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates without substantial myocardial damage however the troponin level was not reported in the study 34 2 sars-cov-2 induced overwhelming inflammatory response and cytokine stormanother suggested mechanism of covid-19 related cardiac involvement is an overwhelming immune-inflammatory response and cytokine storm 6733 the hallmark of cytokine storm syndrome is an uncontrolled and dysfunctional immune response involving the continuous activation and proliferation of lymphocytes and macrophages 24 huang et al have found that patients with covid-19 admitted to the intensive care unit have higher plasma levels of cytokines including interleukins il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and igg-induced protein 10 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha and tumor necrosis factor  1 from a previous study of sars-cov infection and cardiovascular complications subclinical diastolic left ventricular impairment appears to be common during acute sars infection and to be reversible after recovery thus suggesting that left ventricular dysfunction in the acute phase might be associated with cytokine storm syndrome 18 several studies have shown that patients with covid-19 with myocardial injury show evidence of severe systemic inflammation including elevated leukocyte and neutrophil counts interleukin levels c-reactive protein procalcitonin globulin and biomarkers of myocardial injury and stress such as creatine kinase and myoglobin and n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide nt-probnp thus linking myocardial injury to the severity of inflammation and subsequent ventricular dysfunction 242535 similarly in a case report of sars-cov 2 induced fulminant myocarditis the described patient had markedly elevated interleukin 6 thus suggesting that the presence of cytokine storms might have caused increased vascular wall permeability and myocardial edema thus resulting in the observed thickening of the interventricular septum because the myocarditis was transient and recovery was enhanced with the use of continuous renal replacement therapy crrt myocardial injury can be considered to be associated with an excessive immune response mediated by viral infection 363 sars-cov-2 induced severe hypoxia and systemic disturbancessevere hypoxia due to acute lung injury and several systemic complications caused by the virus can result in oxidative stress and hence secondary myocardial injury due to increased myocardial oxygen demand 733 for example in one study there was a characteristic pattern of rise in cardiac troponin i over time the troponin level was normal during admission but subsequently increased in 375 of patients especially in those who died in those patients the troponin level significantly increased in the week preceding the death coinciding with severe systemic disorders including multiple organ failure severe electrolyte disturbances management of ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo severe metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction all of which can potentially lead to secondary myocardial injury due to increased oxidative stress on the heart 37preexisting cardiovascular disease and acute myocardial injury in sars-cov-2studies have demonstrated that patients with underlying cvd and other comorbid conditions are predisposed to myocardial injury during covid-19 the prevalence of hypertension among patients with cardiac injury has been reported to be as high as 45-65 and that of coronary artery disease cad has been reported to be approximately 20-30 table 4 222425in addition to the above mechanisms in patients with underlying cvd the acute systemic inflammatory responses seen in covid-19 can exacerbate inflammatory activity within coronary atherosclerotic plaques thus making the plaques prone to rupture inflammation also causes endothelial dysfunction and increases the procoagulant activity of the blood thereby contributing to the formation of occlusive thrombi over ruptured coronary plaques and predisposing patients to ischemic myocardial injury 38covid-19 and myocarditisthere are several clinically diagnosed myocarditis cases in patients with covid-19 with supporting imaging table 5 3639-41 in the study among 84 patients with covid 19 four 48 were clinically diagnosed with sars-cov-2 myocarditis based on the most updated diagnostic criteria for viral myocarditis 42 however in a single-center retrospective study in 112 admitted patients with confirmed covid-19 the authors explored whether sars-cov-2 caused the myocarditis by performing at least one echocardiographic evaluation in all patients during hospitalization a total of 14 patients 125 presented with abnormalities suggestive of possible myocarditis with an elevation of troponin the myocarditis diagnosis was based on findings of triple elevation in cardiac troponin i 012 ngml plus abnormalities in echocardiography andor ecg the abnormalities in echocardiography were defined as a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction lvef 50 or segmental wall motion abnormality or left ventricular wall thickening 10 mm andor presence of pericardial effusion 5 mm the abnormalities in ecg were defined as st-segment elevationst-t changes the echocardiography did not show typical signs of myocarditis as stated above except for the presence of small pericardial effusion in some patients and nonspecific ecg manifestations most commonly tachycardia which was not typical for myocardial injury but was more suggestive of systemic causes hence the authors suggested that myocardial injury may be more likely to be a result of systemic consequences rather than direct damage by sars-cov-2 37 uncertainties exist whether sars-cov-2 can directly cause cardiomyocyte infection as no biopsy- or autopsy-demonstrated sars-cov-2 localization within cardiomyocytes has been reported to date in a study of covid-19 through post-mortem needle core biopsy of the lung liver and heart in four patients who died of covid-19 pneumonia cardiac biopsy performed in two patients in whom cardiac troponin was elevated during hospital course showed only mild focal fibrosis and mild myocardial hypertrophy which were probably associated with the underlying conditions such as hypertension-associated myocardial hypertrophy and past ischemic injury however there was no evidence of inflammatory cellular infiltration to indicate myocarditis 43tavazzi et al have described the first case in which a biopsy demonstrated myocardial localization of viral particles suggestive of sars-cov-2 in a patient presenting with cardiogenic shock 41 the clinical presentation was suggestive of fulminant myocarditis however the pathologic study demonstrated low-grade myocardial inflammation without evidence of myocardial necrosis given that the viral particles were observed in interstitial cytopathic macrophages and their surroundings but not in cardiac myocytes the authors could not infer viral cardiotropism and suggested that either a viremic phase or migration of infected macrophages from the lung is likely to occur in patients with covid19 with nonischemic acute myocardial injury 41 further investigations along with the histological demonstration of myocarditis inflammatory lymphomonocytic infiltrates plus myocyte necrosis not typical of ischemia 44 and identification of the viral genome in cardiac tissue will be required in the future to clarify the direct association of covid-19 with myocarditispatterns of myocardial injury in covid-19myocardial injury has been shown to present in three different patterns1 the most common pattern is mild troponin elevation typically  99th percentile of the upper reference limit with a modest rise or fall on subsequent days as frequently observed in patients without cardiac symptoms and those who survive after hospitalization 21372 the second pattern is progressive in which some patients have normal troponin levels or moderate troponin elevation during admission however the level progressively increases as the patients experience clinical deterioration with respiratory failure along with an increase in other biomarkers eg interleukin-6 ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase and usually occurs during the second week of hospitalization this pattern is observed among non-survivors and death occurs around a median of 185 days after symptom onset one study has demonstrated that at four days after symptom onset the median high sensitivity cardiac tni hs-ctni levels were 88 pgml in non-survivors vs 25 pgml in survivors during follow-up the median hs-ctni among survivors did not change significantly 25-44 pgml whereas it rose to 247 pgml on day 7 to 557 pgml on day 13 to 1345 pgml on day 19 and to 2906 pgml on day 22 in non-survivors 2132373 the third pattern is early moderate troponin elevation which may approach or exceed the 99th percentile upper reference limit and subsequently fall over the course of illness this pattern is usually seen in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis presenting predominantly with cardiac symptoms 363940clinical features of patients with covid-19 and myocardial injurystudies have shown that patients with cardiac injury are more likely to be older median age 65-74 years than those without cardiac injury 222425 and most patients present with typical symptoms of covid-19 like fever cough fatigue and dyspnea in a study of 291 covid-19 patients 15 of whom had evidence of cardiac injury no patients complained of chest pain or palpitations the common symptoms at illness onset in both groups of patients with or without cardiac injury were similar and included fever cough headache fatigue and dyspnea 22 however a minority of patients with cardiac injury might present with cardiac symptoms with or without respiratory symptoms in another study 11 of 82 134 patients with myocardial injury presented with chest pain compared with 3 of 334 09 patients without cardiac injury p0001 24 in a case report of myocarditis the initial presenting symptom was chest pain and respiratory involvement but an atypical presentation without respiratory symptoms was also described 3637 in terms of radiologic findings bilateral and multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity are more prevalent in patients with than without cardiac injury 25 limited studies in which patients with cardiac injury underwent ecg have revealed ecg abnormalities such as t-wave depression and inversion st-segment depression and q waves 24 patients with clinically suspected myocarditis have been found to have st-segment elevations 3940complicationspatients with cardiac injury and elevated troponin are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit and to develop complications including ards malignant arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardiaventricular fibrillation acute coagulopathy electrolyte disturbances and acute kidney injury and to receive mechanical ventilation crrt extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and vasopressor therapy thus further suggesting that cardiac injury might be associated with the clinical outcomes of covid-19 the use of antibiotic treatment glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment is also significantly higher in patients with cardiac injury than without cardiac injury 2425myocardial injury and mortality in patients with covid-19studies have shown that cardiac injury is associated with higher mortality in patients with covid 19 tables 23 in a case series study in 416 patients with covid-19 the cox regression model after adjustment for age preexisting cardiovascular diseases and other comorbid conditions and complications including ards revealed a significantly higher risk of death in patients with than without cardiac injury either during the time from symptom onset hazard ratio hr 426 95 ci 192-949 or time from admission to study endpoint hr 341 95 ci 162-716 24 similarly in another case series even though patients with covid-19 with cardiac injury and underlying cvd had the highest mortality 6944 patients with underlying cvd but normal tnt levels during the disease course had more favorable prognoses than patients with elevated tnt levels but no underlying cvd mortality 133 vs 375 thus indicating relatively favorable prognosis in patients with underlying cvd but without myocardial injury 25 these studies demonstrate that cardiac injury might be independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with covid-19moreover the mortality rate directly increases with the magnitude of the reference value of cardiac troponin in a single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 patients with covid-19 in wuhan china conducted to explore whether heart injury occurred during covid-19 on admission and later increased mortality approximately 112 of patients had high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i hs-tni exceeding the clinical upper normal limit on admission patients with high levels of hs-tni on admission had significantly higher mortality 500 than patients with moderate or low levels of hs-tni 100 or 91 besides hs-tni level on admission was significantly negatively correlated with the number of survival days r-042 p0005 35 a study by guo et al showed that tnt and nt-probnp levels increased significantly during hospitalization in patients who ultimately died whereas these dynamic changes in tnt or nt-probnp levels were not evident in survivors 25 based on a few studies initial measurement of cardiac biomarkers immediately after hospitalization for sars-cov-2 infection and longitudinal monitoring during the hospital stay may aid in identifying a subset of patients who might progress to a poorer clinical condition however further evidence from more studies is requiredmanagement considerations for acute myocardial injury in patients with covid-19a myocardial injury should be suspected in patients with covid-19 with troponin elevation or new abnormalities in ecg and could be related to type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction myocarditis stress-induced cardiomyopathy or cytokine induced-myocardial injury 4546 the approach to evaluating myocardial injury in patients with known or suspected covid-19 should be based on balancing the benefits of further evaluation in changing the management strategy versus the potential risk of nosocomial spread of covid-19 infection 4546as such elevated troponin levels should not be considered as evidence of acute myocardial infarction which is diagnosed based on symptoms and signs of ischemia and ecg changes 9 in a multicenter case series study form six hospitals in new york inpatients with confirmed covid-19 who had st-segment elevation on ecg with the elevation of cardiac enzymes 10 out of 18 patients were classified as having noncoronary myocardial injury with no evidence of obstructive disease on coronary angiography and normal wall motion on echocardiography eight patients received a clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction the median peak troponin level was higher in patients with myocardial infarction than in those with a clinical diagnosis of noncoronary myocardial injury 47 if the clinical presentation is suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome acs timely evaluation is required to determine the need for urgent intervention in patients with covid-19 who have mild to moderate troponin elevation without symptoms and signs of acute heart failure clinical monitoring may be performed without routine cardiac imaging until the recovery from the acute viral syndrome 46 for patients with clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure echocardiography may be performed if the management strategy and prognosis would be likely to change with the diagnosis the possible diagnosis in the patients with ventricular wall motion abnormalities elevated troponin and no acs include clinically suspected myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy 45 as there is no established therapy for clinically suspected myocarditis routine evaluation with cardiovascular magnetic resonance or endomyocardial biopsy in those cases is not recommended 45 as such regardless of fulminant or non-fulminant presentation american college of cardiology recommends against routine endomyocardial biopsy in patients with active covid-19 with abnormal cardiac enzymes as biopsy is unlikely to change immediate clinical management whether the etiology is due to myocarditis cytokine-induced myocardial injury or type- 2 myocardial infarction 4546unfortunately beyond guidelines for treating patients with ischemic myocardial injury no consensus exists regarding the routine management of patients with covid-19 and myocardial injury the management of myocardial injury focuses on identifying and treating the underlying cause and supportive care including management of heart failure therapy of arrhythmias and avoidance of cardiotoxins 4546 if the patient clinically deteriorates or develop hemodynamic instability or has severely elevated or rapidly rising troponin detailed evaluation cardiology consultation and enrollment in clinical trials or experimental therapies like antiviral agents anti-cytokines il-6 inhibitors such as tocilizumab the convalescent plasma may be considered on the case-by-case basis 46 although the use of steroids has not been recommended in the general treatment of covid-19 some reports have described patients recovering from fulminant myocarditis with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids however more studies will be needed to determine which patient would benefit from such therapies 8 for patients with refractory shock or ventricular arrhythmias secondary to fulminant myocarditis early institution of mechanical support with ecmo can be considered as case reports with the successful rescue of such patients have been described 46 in general as the presence of cvd and myocardial injury in covid-19 patients has been associated with more severe outcomes and increased mortality triaging patients with covid-19 according to the presence of underlying cvd and evidence of myocardial injury for prioritized treatment strategies may be reasonable 25finally several therapies with potential cardiovascular side effects are currently being studied and caution must be used when administering these therapies to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease for example preliminary clinical research has suggested the potential efficacy of hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin for treatment of covid-19 but this is associated with qtc prolongation and risk of fatal arrhythmias thus warranting regular monitoring of qtc 48 controversy remains concerning the use of aceiarb for covid-19 some preclinical studies have suggested that raas inhibitors may increase ace2 functional receptor for sars-cov-2 expression raising concerns regarding safety in patients with covid-19 however the data remain anecdotal and no clinical studies have evaluated the effects of raas inhibitors in covid-19 as such several leading professional societies recommend continuation of raas inhibitors for patients who are at risk for being evaluated for or currently have covid-19 and are taking these medications to treat other conditions for which these agents are known to be beneficial such as heart failure or ischemic heart disease 49future directionsmost studies have been conducted on chinese cohorts and thus the generalizability of the results to other countries including the united states remains to be determined most studies have been single-centered retrospective studies with the enrollment of small numbers of patients larger cohorts multicenter and prospective studies should be planned they should include assessment of detailed heart function related data particularly ecg echocardiography and possibly cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to determine myocardial function and the etiology and mechanism of cardiac injury most studies have not discussed why troponin was measured in the first place and no data are available to support a different management strategy for patients with elevated troponin studies must be planned to define whether adjunctive cardioprotective therapies such as corticosteroids immunosuppressants antivirals agents interferons andor immunomodulatory therapy immunoglobulins may be advisable for patients with significant elevation of cardiac injury biomarkers pathological examination of myocardial tissue of patients with covid-19 with definite myocardial injury will be needed to provide pathological evidence of the etiology of myocardial injury and establish covid-19 as a new etiological agent for myocarditisin conclusion covid-19 has been associated with an increased prevalence of acute cardiac injury even more so in patients with severe disease the presence of preexisting cardiovascular disease increases the risk of cardiac injury in patients with covid-19 although the exact mechanism underlying the association of cardiac injury in patients with covid-19 remains unclear direct virus-induced cardiomyocyte injury leading to viral myocarditis systemic cytokine-mediated myocardial injury and hypoxia-induced myocardial oxidative stress have been suggested the presence of myocardial injury is independently associated with mortality and may be a predictor of progression to severe disease and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19 further studies are needed to elucidate the predominant etiology of myocardial injury in patients with covid-19 and to promote targeted treatment programs to improve patient prognosisfebrile urinary tract infection uti is the most common serious bacterial infection in children 13 febrile uti can occur simultaneously with a respiratory tract infection but the likelihood of uti has been reported to be significantly lower among respiratory virus-positive than in virus-negative febrile infants 4 5 highly sensitive multiplex polymerase chain reaction pcr assays and other nucleic acid amplification tests with short turnaround times are currently widely used in hospitals and emergency departments eds for detecting respiratory viruses however positive results must be interpreted with caution since certain respiratory viruses like rhinoviruses coronaviruses and human bocavirus are frequently detected also in asymptomatic children 6 in addition to rapid and sensitive virus detection methods a biomarker of host response to respiratory virus infection could be useful in the evaluation of febrile infantsmyxovirus resistance protein a mxa is an interferon-inducible protein with antiviral activity against a wide range of viruses that cause respiratory gastrointestinal and generalized infections 7 8 it has been studied as a potential biomarker of symptomatic viral infections due to its broad antiviral range rapid induction in 1 to 2 h after onset of symptoms and low basal levels in healthy children 9 10 blood mxa protein levels are markedly elevated in symptomatic viral infections but not in respiratory virus-positive asymptomatic children 7 mxa response has not been extensively studied in very young infants or in children with coinciding viral and bacterial infections in a study of acute pharyngitis elevated blood mxa levels were found in children coinfected with a respiratory virus and group a streptococcus but not in children with only group a streptococcus infection 11the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic respiratory virus infections in children hospitalized with febrile uti and to estimate antiviral immune responses by the blood mxa protein levelsthis study was a part of a

and the specificity was 59 when discriminating between virus-positive children with or without respiratory symptoms the auc was 10 95 ci 1010 and a cutoff level of 434 gl gave sensitivity and specificity of 100nineteen 44 children had received live attenuated oral rotavirus vaccine within 30 days prior to entering the study none had received other live vaccines during this period when children with respiratory symptoms were excluded from the analyses there was no significant difference in the median iqr blood mxa level in children n  12 recently vaccinated with rotavirus vaccine 219 140322 gl compared to children n  24 without a preceding live virus vaccination 140 83275 gl p  018 in children without respiratory symptoms the median iqr blood mxa levels were 186 126322 gl in those below the age of 12 months n  25 and 129 66191 gl p  0074 in those at or above the age of 12 months n  7we frequently found respiratory viruses by multiplex pcr panels in children with febrile uti at least one respiratory virus was detected in 40 of children hospitalized with febrile uti however nearly half of the virus-positive children did not have any focal symptoms of a respiratory tract infection antiviral immune response of the host was demonstrated by elevated blood mxa protein level in all virus-positive children who had respiratory symptoms our results emphasize the high detection rate of respiratory viruses using multiplex pcr tests in nasopharyngeal samples of children with febrile uti and show the potential of blood mxa protein as a biomarker of a symptomatic viral infectionto our knowledge this is the first study to examine symptoms of respiratory tract infection respiratory viruses and antiviral immune responses in children with febrile uti earlier studies have investigated the risk of serious bacterial infection in febrile infants with or without respiratory virus infection the presence of a respiratory virus infection has been reported to reduce the probability of uti among febrile infants in comparison with virus-negative children 4 5 but there are differences between viruses in this regard the risk of concomitant uti in infants with respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus infection detected either by pcr or by an antigen test is lower than the risk in virus-negative children 1214 on the contrary in another study the probability of uti was not substantially lower in rhinovirus-positive compared with virus-negative infants 14multiplex respiratory virus pcr panels include viruses which frequently cause asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections such as rhinovirus or coronavirus and viruses that persist in the airways such as human bocavirus and positive results for at least one virus are common also in healthy children 6 7 the perception that virus positivity reduces the risk of uti or other serious bacterial infection possibly does not apply if febrile children are systematically tested with broad multiplex pcr panels our results of frequent respiratory virus findings with or without respiratory symptoms in children with uti support this view as expected by its frequency in all young children 15 rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus our results call for diagnostic stewardship in terms of whom to test for respiratory viruses by using highly multiplexed sensitive diagnostic assays if multiplex pcr is routinely used in febrile children in the ed blood mxa protein could serve as a useful biomarker for a symptomatic viral infectionwe report somewhat higher cutoff levels for blood mxa protein than previous studies 7 8 we examined mainly infants but age does not seem to fully explain this finding we did not find any large differences in mxa levels in infants below the age of 12 months compared to older children when those with respiratory symptoms were excluded this is consistent with our previous study in which we found higher baseline levels of blood mxa protein in children compared to adults but similar levels at ages 2 and 13 months 7 it is important to consider the role of rotavirus or other live virus vaccinations in studies of mxa protein or other interferon-inducible proteins in children as live vaccines can increase blood mxa levels temporarily 7 16 however recent rotavirus vaccination had only minor effect on blood mxa protein levels in the present study similarly to our earlier observations 7 we also earlier reported that febrile respiratory infections were associated with substantially higher blood mxa levels than infections without fever 7 the current study included febrile children only and although the cause of fever was presumably uti in most children some children may have been febrile because of a simultaneous viral infection this could have affected the blood mxa levels in children with no apparent respiratory symptomsour study has certain limitations first despite using aseptic techniques to collect urine samples we cannot rule out the possibility of contamination or asymptomatic bacteriuria if symptoms were caused by a virus infection being labeled as a uti second the relatively small number of children limits the generalizability of our results third a further study with a comparison group without uti would help in understanding whether the risk of uti is reduced in febrile children with respiratory virus infection and elevated blood mxa levelin conclusion our study showed that respiratory viruses are frequently detected in children with febrile uti when using multiplex pcr methods an antiviral host response was demonstrated by elevated blood mxa levels in children with uti and simultaneous respiratory symptoms blood mxa protein could be a robust biomarker of symptomatic viral infection in children with febrile uti its use in evaluation of febrile infants deserves further studyin general three major types of studying samples have been employed in lung cell proteomic studies including in vitro lung cell cultures bronchial fluids obtained from lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf wattiez and falmagne 2005 or sputum secretions expectorated from the respiratory tract kips et al 1998 as well as the other body fluids ie serum plasma blood cells or urine for instance and the most traditional method of using lung tissues from biopsies or autopsies fig 1 overall each method has its own merit to the understanding of the etiology of the disease or the action mechanism of an agent to the lung cells usually biomarker study by sampling of body fluids is a convenient way to obtain the starting material compared with using biopsies or autopsies the generation of geneknockout mice eg cystic fibrosis cf transmembrane receptor knockout mice as a studying model of cf also tremendously facilitated the discovery of the biomarkers and the understanding of this severely genetic disease bensalem et al 2005 brouillard et al 2005in order to facilitate the process of biomarker discovery many enrichment methods and strategies have been developed in recent years the advancement of proteomics has pushed to the level of investigating the proteome in individual organelles socalled the subcellular proteome in this scenario only a particular type of organelle inside the cell for example mitochondria or nuclear is first separated from all the other cellular components and then being studied lau et al 2003 wang et al 2008 this method reduces the complexity and also indirectly provides for an enrichment of the proteins being studied and as a corollary of this it can facilitate the resolution of protein separation and enhance the sensitivity of protein detection by mass spectrometry subcellular proteomics is particularly useful to delineate the functional significance of the subcellular localization of a protein where conventional proteomics using whole cell extract can never achieve this result further the use of laser capture dissection on tissues can efficiently obtain more homogeneous cell type for research instead of contamination of mixtures of cancer and normal cells gutstein and morris 2007 other methods like albumin depletion in serum samples before proteomic analysis also facilitated the identification of biomarkers in which otherwise masked by these albumin proteins on 2d gels lei et al 2008 in addition partial purification or concentration of substances secreted into lung fluids or released to the culture medium from cultured lung cells after being challenged by stimulatory agents also greatly provided a very good means for proteomics to study lung response and identify biomarkers for various diseases and complicationsusing various cuttingedge proteomic approaches in recent years lots of newly identified biomarkers of lungrelated diseases have been reported in this article we are particularly interested in the study of 1 genetic diseases 2 inflammatory and allergy diseases 3 infectious diseases and 4 lung cancercf which is an autosomal recessive inherited disease results from the mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor cftr gene tsui 1995 zielenski and tsui 1995 mutation of this receptor results in defective anion secretion and excessive na reuptake across epithelia leading to insufficient intraluminal hydration this causes mucus accumulation and defective impaction states in intestine as well as impaired mucociliary clearance in airways stutts et al 1995 kunzelmann and mall 2003 currently there is no cure for individuals with cf however through more indepth studies this would allow scientists to understand the mechanisms governing the etiology of this disease and more effective medications could be applied to patients which can prolong their lifespan resulting from this diseaseseveral recent proteomic studies have provided some interesting candidate proteins as possible biomarkers of cf it was shown that low abundance inflammatoryassociated autoantigens like myeloperoxidase were identified by immunoproteomic approach from sputum of subjects with cf this approach was also exploited for detecting proteins expressed by the pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pa01 which is a frequent pathogenic organism invading lungs of cf patients capture of pa01 antigens using circulating antibodies from cf subjects implicated in vivo expression of pseudomonas proteins of all the cf subjects tested but not controls were immunoreactive against immunocaptured pseudomonas proteins implicating their possibility as biomarkers of p aeruginosa infection pedersen et al 2005 in another study of salineinduced sputum from adults with cf with an exacerbation extensive proteolytic igg degradation and influx of inflammationrelated proteins were observed indicating these changes as predictors of cf lung exacerbation sloane et al 2005 also while the main highmolecular mass proteins in the sputum from all subjects were the mucins muc5b and muc5ac these appeared degraded in cf adults with an exacerbation the glycosylation of these mucins also showed reduced sulfation increased sialylation and reduced fucosylation in cf adults compared with controls schulz et al 2007besides using sputum serum samples from cf patients have been pooled and compared with equivalent pools of control sera in order to identify patterns of protein expression unique to cf by antibody microarrays the set of significantly differentially expressed protein was enriched in protein mediators or inflammation from the nfb signaling pathway srivastava et al 2006 also in pediatric cf patients selditofms balf profiling identified 53 unique reliable proteins they included the neutrophil proteins defensin 1 and 2 calciumbinding proteins s100a8 s100a9 and s100a12 as well as novel forms of s100a8 and s100a12 with equivalent cterminal deletions concentrations of these molecules are abnormally high in early cf patients the data provide new insights into cf lung disease and identify novel proteins strongly associated with cf airway inflammation mcmorran et al 2007 using cf bronchial biopsies in normal and cf patients the chaperone 75 kda glucoseregulated protein and ubiquinolcytochrome c reductase complex core protein i and one form of nidogen a pseudogene of aconitase 2 were increased in cf aberrant chaperone and metabolic proteins in cf may reflect molecular changes of cf as well as cflinked inflammation infection and cellular stress response frischer et al 2006further an examination of protein profiles of cultured cf lung epithelial cells ib31 f508w1282x by 2dems analysis gave rise to 194 identified proteins among the high abundance proteins identified were sets of proteins associated with inflammation including the classical nfb p65 rela and nfb p65 relb pollard et al 2005 following this study by comparing the ib31 cells with ib31s9 daughter cells repaired by gene transfer with aavwildtype cftr by simultaneous measurement of de novo biosynthetic rate with 35smethionine of all 194 proteins in both cell types resulted in the identification of an additional 31 cfspecific proteins this kinetic portion of the high abundance cf proteome hidden from direct analysis of abundance included proteins from transcription and signaling pathways such as nfb chaperones such as hsc70 cytoskeletal proteins and others the conclusion of this study was that measurement of biosynthetic rates on a global scale could be used to identify diseasespecific differences within the high abundance cf proteome pollard et al 2006 finally using cftr
 mice annexin a1 was found to be absent in their colonic crypts concurrently annexin a1 was also undetectable in lungs and pancreas of these mice it was suggested that the absence of this inhibitory mediator of the host inflammatory response was associated with colonic upregulation of the proinflammatory cytosolic phospholipase a2 more importantly annexin a1 was also downregulated in nasal epithelial cells from cf patients suggesting that decreased expression of annexin a1 contributed to the worsening of the cf phenotype bensalem et al 2005 following this study the same group also demonstrated that mcica3 a member of a family of calciumactivated chloride channels considered to be key molecules in mucus secretion by globlet cells was significantly decreased in the colon and lung of the cftr
 mice these results substantiated the conclusion that a cicarelated function in the cf colon was dependent on cftr expression and may be correlated with the impaired expression of mcica3 brouillard et al 2005asthma is a chronic disorder of airway inflammation characterized by variable airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness maddox and schwartz 2002 it is suggested that thelper type 2 lymphocytes and the cytokines that they produce in conjunction with reactive oxygen species ros and reactive nitrogen species rns produced by inflammatory and epithelial cells contributed as the key mediators of the chronic airway inflammation of asthma calhoun et al 1992 horwitz and busse 1995 renauld 2001 zhou et al 2001 the airway surface is covered by a thin fluid layer termed as the airway surface liquid and this acts as a barrier to protect the underlying epithelium widdicombe 2002 the identification of secreted proteins in this fluid may be important in understanding the etiology of asthmaby using ovalbumin ova as an allergen in mouse model of asthma several groups of researchers provided new insights into pathogenesis of asthma and they may be useful as surrogate biomarkers for asthma it has been shown that ovainduced oxidative stress resulted in proteolysis of annexin1 and consequent upregulation of cytosolic phospholipase a2 activity and leukotriene production in the lungs of these mice chung et al 2004 nitrotyrosine is a marker of cellular oxidative stress over 30 different proteins were targets of nitration following ova challenge including the antioxidative enzyme catalase oxidative modification at cys377 of catalase and loss of the enzyme activity was observed subsequent analysis of human balf showed that catalase activity was reduced in asthma by up to 50 as compared with normal controls this study provided insights that catalase inactivation might be the one of the culprits contributing to the chronic inflammatory state of the asthmatic airway ghosh et al 2006 while other studies showed that lungkine a recently described chemokine a family of chitinases including ym1 ym2 fizz1 and acidic mammalian chitinase gob5 a protein that mediates mucus secretion and surfactant proteind a ctype lectin capable of modulating inflammatory responses were significantly increased in the balfs of ovatreated asthmatic mice zhao et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 finally using plasma peptides from control and chronic asthma mice induced by ova the authors quantitatively identified the fragment f of complement 3 c3f which is important for inflammation was significantly higher in controls than chronic asthma mice this study suggested that native small peptides detected by non2de techniques may be useful and specific biomarkers of disease yeo et al 2004 in human subjects clinical study of patients by using peripheral tlymphocytes from six normal individuals and six patients with asthma increased expression of phosphodiesterase 4c and thioredoxin2 and decreased expression of glutathione stransferase m3 were confirmed in asthmatic patients which may indicate as important biomarkers and therapeutic targets jeong et al 2007 finally it has been shown that gelsolin level was elevated in the balf of patients with asthma the elevated level of gelsolin was proposed to improve the fluidity of airway surface liquid in asthma by breaking down filamentous actin that was released by dying cells during inflammation candiano et al 2005acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients ware and matthay 2000 it is characterized by an acute pulmonary inflammatory process with epithelial apoptosis and interstitial and intraalveolar edema and the subsequent fibroblast proliferation migration and fibrosis dechert 2003using shotgun proteomics several interesting proteins were identified in the balf of patients with ards including insulinlike growth factorbinding protein3 igfbp3 normal controls had low levels of igfbp3 whereas patients with early ards had a significant increase in igfbp3 these results exhibited that the igf pathway regulated apoptosis of lung fibroblasts but not lung epithelial cells and igf pathway may contribute to the fibroproliferative response in ards schnapp et al 2006 in another study using selditof and electrophoresisbased proteomics it was found that increased levels of apolipoprotein a1 s100a8 and s100a9 proteins in the balf of subjects challenged with bronchial lung endotoxin and patients with ards de torre et al 2006 additionally in a more recent study in order to address the complex and dynamic changes that occurred during the course of ards a quantitative proteomic approach was employed to profile proteins in the balf of patients with ards at days 1 3 and 7 after the onset of illness and compared with those of healthy control subjects results indicated that there were an enrichment of proteins involved in inflammation infection and injury in ards patients the protein network analysis signified that the protein interactions in ards were complex and redundant and revealed unexpected central components in the protein networks nevertheless the data in this study demonstrated the new relationships among proteins and identified new groups of mediators that could be targets for novel treatments chang et al 2008chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd is a lung disease in which the airways become narrowed and lead to a limitation of airflow causing shortness of breathe barnes et al 2003 in contrast to asthma this limitation of airflow is poorly reversible and the syndrome worsens progressively over time cigarette smoking which exposes the lung to a high concentration of ros is the major risk factor for copd hogg 2004one goal in copd research is the identification of biomarkers for early diagnosis of the disease increased levels of surfactant proteina spa were found in copd but not in the normal or fibrotic lung also elevated spa protein levels were detected from the induced sputum supernatants of copd patients while the levels of other surfactant proteins spb spc spd were not altered these data revealed that spa was linked to the pathogenesis of copd and could be considered as a potential copd biomarker ohlmeier et al 2008 in a recent study serum amyloid a saa was identified as a novel blood biomarker of acute exacerbations of copd aecopd that was more sensitive than creactive protein alone or in combination with dyspnea saa may offer new insights into the pathogenesis of aecopd bozinovski et al 2008 by combining seldi and malditofms analysis results signified that the concentrations of neutrophil defensins 1 and 2 s100a8 and s100a9 were elevated in balfs of smokers with copd when compared with asymptomatic smokers increased concentrations of s100a8 salivary prolinerich peptide pc and lysozyme c were detected in balfs of asymptomatic smokers when compared with nonsmokers whereas salivary prolinerich pd and clara cell phospholipidsbinding protein cc10 were reduced in their concentration these identified proteins and peptides might be useful in the future as diagnostic markers for smokeinduced lung irritations and copd merkel et al 2005 several unfold protein response upr proteins have been shown to be upregulated in chronic smokers compared with nonsmokers and exsmokers including the chaperones glucoseregulated protein 78 grp78 and calreticulin a foldase protein disulfide isomerase pdi and enzymes involved in antioxidant defense the clinical relevance of this study was that chronic smoking induced an endoplasmic reticulum stress response in human lung failure of this compensatory system may contribute to the development of copd kelsen et al 2008 lastly lung tissues obtained from nonsmokers smokers without copd and smokers with copd found that mmp13 and thioredoxinlike 2 were increased in patients with copd these two proteins increased in the healthy smoker group and then increased further in the copd group suggesting that these both might be more closely associated with the development of airflow limitation lee et al 2009particulates also known as ambient particulate matter pm are tiny airborne particles there is a correlation between inhalation of pm and increases in the morbidity and mortality of respiratory diseases laden et al 2000 samet et al 2000it was shown that in the dose range of 10100 gml organic diesel exhaust particles dep extracts induced a progressive oxidative stress in the macrophage cell line raw2647 malditofms analysis showed that 32 newly inducednacsuppressed proteins were identified these included antioxidant enzymes heme oxygenase1 and catalase proinflammatory components p38mapk and rel a and products of intermediary metabolism that were regulated by oxidative stress xiao et al 2003 later the same group of researchers showed that treatment of beas2b cells with organic dep chemicals caused the induction of at least 14 proteins among which heat shock protein hsp70 hsp40 tpr2 and tcomplex protein 1 zetasubunit were known to play a role in the upr dep extracts also induced the expression of il6 and il8 in the culture supernatant these responses could be abrogated in the presence of nac jung et al 2007 these data exhibited that dep induced oxidative stress response upr and proinflammatory effects and that some of these proteins may serve as markers for pm exposures other airborne pm with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 m pm10 is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds containing sulfates and various metals such as titanium pagan et al 2003 because acute and chronic exposures to tio2 particles have been shown to induce inflammatory responses in the airways and alveolar spaces of rats schapira et al 1995 warheit et al 1997 ahn et al 2005 kang et al 2005 tio2treated rats are tested as a good model for the study of the human epithelial response to pm10 particles treatment of epithelial cells with bsacoated tio2 particles altered expression of 20 proteins these included defenserelated cell activating and cytoskeletal proteins implicated in the response to oxidative stress among one of these proteins was macrophage migrationinhibitory factor mif mif was expressed primarily in epithelium and was elevated in lung tissues and balfs of tio2treated rats interestingly carbon black and dep also induced expression of mif protein in the epithelial cells cha et al 2007 last but not the least ultrafine carbon black ufcb which is carboncentered ultrafine particles 01 m in diameter comprises the majority of fine particulate matters oberdrster and utell 2002 significantly greater increases in neutrophils influx and total proteins in balf have been observed after intratracheal instillation of ufcb compared with carbon black 250 nm in diameter li et al 1996 ufcb also acts through a rosdependent pathway to cause vascular endothelial growth factor vegf production and lung injury in mice chang et al 2005 further proteomic study was carried out with balf from mice after treatment with ufcb results showed that ufcb exposure caused the increase of epidermal growth factor receptor egfr and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor lifr in balf and decrease of both receptors in lung tissues suggesting the acceleration of epithelial shedding from the lungs and increase of cell debris with membrane proteins egfr and lifr in balf these data revealed the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of ufcbinduced lung injury chang et al 2007severe acute respiratory syndrome sars caused by coronavirus cov also known as atypical pneumonia had emerged as a pandemic threat in 2003 drosten et al 2003 ksiazek et al 2003 peiris et al 2003 understanding its pathogenesis and developing specific diagnostic methods for its early diagnosis are crucial for the effective management and control of this diseasealthough the genome sequencing and comparative analysis provided some abundant information to predict the structures and functions of the proteins comprising this virus the possible posttranslational modifications and cleavage products are difficult to be obtained from the genome sequence using sarscovinfected vero e6 cells several studies provided new perspectives in the functions of the sarscov viral proteins and the cellular responses in hes group they identified and characterized the structural proteins of sarscov isolated from vero e6 cells infected with the bj01 strain of the virus ying et al 2004 in another study the cytosol and nucleus fractions of sarscovinfected cells as well as the crude virions were analyzed by onedimensional electrophoresis followed by esimsms identification or by shotgun strategy with twodimensional liquid chromatographyesimsms of all the four predicted structural proteins of sarscov including s spike m membrane n nucleocapsid and e envelope proteins were identified this study indicated that 2dlcmsms made contribution to rapidly and accurately characterize whether the cells contained virus and may be used for rapid screening the virus virusinfected cells or even body fluids zeng et al 2004a further characterization of the 3a protein of sarscov in infected vero e6 cells and sera from sars patients showed that there was a tendency existed for comutation between the 3a protein and the spike protein of sarscov isolates the conclusion was that the 3a protein might be tightly correlated to the spike protein in the sarscov functions and it may serve as a new clinical marker or drug target for sars treatment zeng et al 2004b to analyze the differential cellular response to sarscov the proteome of vero e6 cells with and without infection of sarscov were resolved and quantitated with twodimensional gel electrophoresis followed by esimsms identification also icat technology coupled with twodimensional lcmsms were applied to the differential proteins of infected cells by combining these two methods 355 unique proteins were identified and quantitated with 186 of them differentially expressed this has been perhaps by far the most comprehensive proteomic index for sarscovinfected cells and the identified differential profile furnished a valuable resource for diagnosis drug development and treatment for sars jiang et al 2005using serum from sars patients several groups including ours provided useful biomarkers for the diagnosis of sars our study in 2004 by using proteomic technology showed that truncated forms of 1antitrypsin tf1at were increased significantly and consistently in sera of sars patients compared with control subjects the dramatic increase in tf1at may be the results of degradation of 1at as 1at plays an important role in the protection of lung function its degradation may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of sars and also may be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of sars ren et al 2004 using selditofms analysis on 89 sera collected from 28 sars patients and 72 sera from 51 control patients with various viral or bacterial infections and 10 sera from apparently healthy individuals 9 significantly increased and 3 significantly decreased serum biomarkers were discovered in the sars patients compared with the controls among these upregulated markers saa protein was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometric analysis and there was a good correlation between saa concentration and the extent of pneumonia saa could be used to monitor disease activity and response to treatment in sars patients yip et al 2005 in another study using serum of 39 patients with earlystage sars infection and 39 suspected sars patients during the sars outbreak period the authors reported that 2 proteomic features having the highest diagnostic value were the nterminal fragment of complement c3c chain and an internal fragment of fibrinogen e chain pang et al 2006 in a recent study a coronavirus proteome microarray that contained the entire proteomes of the human sarscov and five additional coronaviruses was constructed these microarrays were used to screen 400 canadian sera from the sars outbreak including samples from confirmed sarscov cases respiratory illness patients and healthcare professionals these arrays can serve as a rapid sensitive and simple tool for largescale identification of viralspecific antibodies in sera zhu et al 2006besides serum the proteome of plasma from sars patients were investigated a complete proteomic analysis was performed on four patients with sars in different time courses and a total of 38 differential spots were selected for protein identification most of the proteins identified were acute phase proteins and their presence represented the consequence of serial cascades initiated by sarscov infection there were several proteins that have never been identified in plasma before using 2d gel electrophoresis among which was peroxiredoxin ii prx ii the high level of plasma prx ii in patients with sars could be secreted by t cells which indicated that active innate immune responses along with the oxidationassociated injuries may play a role in the pathogenesis of sars chen et al 2004 in another recent study plasma proteins of sars patients with those of a normal control group were compared to enrich the lowabundance proteins in human plasma two highly abundant proteins albumin and igg were first depleted the upregulated proteins were identified as alpha1 acid glycoprotein haptoglobin 1antichymotrypsin and fetuin the downregulated proteins were apolipoprotein a1 transferrin and transthyretin since all these upregulated proteins identified above are wellknown inflammation inhibitors there is some mechanism that sustains the inflammation balance in sars patients which is helpful for the proper treatment and therapy of this disease wan et al 2006tuberculosis tb is a disease caused by lower respiratory tract infection of mycobacterium tuberculosis approximately one third of the worlds population is currently infected with this pathogen and nearly 2 million people died of tb annually clarkcurtiss and haydel 2003 m tuberculosis is a facultative intracellular bacterium which persists and replicates within host phagocytes predominantly macrophages and dendritic cells clarkcurtiss and haydel 2003 upon phagocytosis m tuberculosis establish themselves in an early endosomal compartment and arrest phagosome maturation then replicate and colonize the persistence of its colonization in phagosomes of host phagocytes and development of drug resistance makes tb one of the top 10 diseases that cause people to die from this disease in the world world health organization 2008 therefore proteomic technology becomes an indispensable tool as to identify early diagnostic markers for tbto identify proteins of m tuberculosis unique to the intraphagosomal phase mycobacteria were purified from phagosomes of infected murine bone marrowderived macrophages and analyzed by 2de and ms results indicated that 11 mycobacterial proteins were exclusively detected in intraphagosomal mycobacteria when compared with those of brothcultured mycobacteria six of the identified proteins were only observed in phagosomal mycobacteria namely phosphoglycerate mutase i gpm rv0489 a lipid carrier protein rv1627c a putative potassium uptake protein trka rv2691 and the conserved hypothetical proteins rv0428c rv1130 and rv1191 have not been identified previously in brothcultured mycobacteria suggesting that these proteins were indeed unique to phagosomal m tuberculosis the identification of the roles of these proteins and targeted drug design would allow direct interference of their functions to control intracellular growth of mycobacteria mattow et al 2006 in another study proteins secreted in the culture medium from the m tuberculosis kstrain which is the most prevalent among the clinical isolates in korea and belongs to the beijing family were analyzed by 2d page and compared with those from the m tuberculosis h37rv and cdc1551 strains eleven proteins rv0652 rv1636 rv2818c rv3369 rv3865 rv0566c mt3304 rv3160 rv3874 rv0560c and rv3648c were identified by malditofms or lcesims all these proteins were cloned and expressed in e coli and affinity purified by using three of these recombinant proteins in an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa when 100 sera from tb patients and 100 sera from the healthy controls were analyzed rrv3369 rrv3874 and rrv0566c showed a sensitivity of 60 74 and 43 and a specificity of 96 97 and 84 respectively these results displayed that the rrv3369 and rrv3874 proteins which were expressed more abundantly in the more recently obtained clinical isolates of m tuberculosis than in the laboratoryadapted h37rv strain were promising for use in the serodiagnosis of tb bahk et al 2004 a 32kda putative glyoxalase in the culture filtrate of growing m tuberculosis originally annotated as rv0577 which is now designed as cfp32 was identified cloned and characterized expression of cfp32 was provided by the serum recognition of recombinant cfp32 in 32 of tb patients by elisa as well as the direct detection of cfp32 by elisa in the induced sputum samples from 56 of pulmonary tb patients interestingly per sample sputum cfp32 levels a potential indicator of increasing bacterial burden correlated with levels of expression in sputum of interleukin10 an immunosuppressive cytokine and a putative contributing factor to disease progression but not levels of gamma interferon a key cytokine in the protective immune response in tb as measured by elisa together these data suggested that cfp32 may be useful as a diagnostic drug andor vaccine target for tb huard et al 2003mtb81 a novel serological marker for tb identified by serological proteome analysis is a promising antigen for the serodiagnosis of tb it is suggested that the combination of mtb81 and the previously identified 38kda antigen in conjunction with other novel m tuberculosis antigens would lead to optimal sensitivity for the serodiagnosis of tb and potentially improve clinical sensitivity for tbpositive individuals coinfected with hiv hendrickson et al 2000 following this study the same group reported the use of multiepitope polyproteins in serodiagnosis of active tb this time three more tb antigens mtb11 also known as cfp10 mtb8 and mtb48 were tested together with the previously reported 38kda protein as well as their previously identified antigen mtb81 improved reactivity was observed which indicated that the use of multiple antigens with some of which in a single polyprotein can be used to facilitate the development of a highly sensitive test for m tuberculosis antibody detection houghton et al 2002 finally in a recent study serum proteomic profiles were obtained from patients with active tb and controls by selditofms a supervised machinelearning approach based on the support vector machine svm was used to obtain a classifier that distinguished between the groups in two independent test sets a classifier trained on the 20 most informative peaks achieved diagnostic accuracy of 90 from these two peptides saa protein and transthyretin were identified and quantitated by immunoassay since these peptides reflected inflammatory states the authors also quantitated neopterin and creactive protein application of an svm classifier using combinations of these values gave diagnostic accuracies of up to 84 for tb the potential biomarkers for tb that was identified in this study through proteomic fingerprinting and pattern recognition have a plausible biological connection with the disease and could be used to develop new diagnostic tests agranoff et al 2006lung cancer is a malignant disease of heterogeneous histologies and has been divided into two major groups small cell lung cancer sclc and nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc nsclc accounts for 75 of lung cancers and falls into three major types squamous cell carcinoma scc adenocarcinoma large cell lung cancer lclc and also less frequently found carinoids srivastava et al 1994 cigarette smoking is a leading cause of lung cancers resulting in a death toll of 13 million annually ezzati et al 2005 worldwide mortality rate is increasing probably due to early smoking trend in teenage group cigarette made from tobacco and contained more than thousands of known and unknown toxic compounds and carcinogens strongly promote lung cancer development lung cancer may be seen on chest xray and computed tomography ct scan swensen et al 2005 the diagnosis is confirmed with a biopsy possible treatments include surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy with treatment administrated to patients the 5year survival rate is just around 14 jemal et al 2005 although early treatment seems promising in higher survival rate it is virtually impossible to cure advanced stage lung cancer no matter what there is an urgent need to set up biomarkers for early lung cancer detection as well as proper drug development for treating this diseasein beers group a series of 93 lung adenocarcinomas and 10 uninvolved lung samples were examined by 2dpage results indicated that antioxidant enzyme aoe372 atp synthase subunit d atp5d 14galactosyltransferase cytosolic inoraganic pyrophosphatase glucoseregulated mr 58000 protein glutathionestransferase m4 prolyl 4hydroxylase  subunit triosephosphate isomerase and ubiquitin thiolesterase uchl1 were identified being significantly overexpressed in lung adenocarcinomas chen et al 2002 using the same batch of samples beers group also demonstrated that 14 of 21 isoforms of cytokeratin 7 ck7 ck8 ck18 and ck19 occurred at significantly higher levels in tumors compared with those of uninvolved adjacent tissue gharib et al 2002 similarly our recent study also demonstrated that increased expressions of ck8 and ck14 in cadmiuminduced lung cell transformation lau and chiu 2007 it is suggested that increased expressions of specific cytokeratins can act as a scaffold to bind to apoptotic factors preventing them to do their functions which can provide additional survival advantages to evade apoptosis therefore specific isoforms of individual ck may have utility as diagnostic or predictive markers in lung tumorigenesis using laser capture microdissection differential proteins between primary lung adenocarcinoma with lnm adc and without lymph node metastasis nonlnm adc were identified by 2ddigems it was found that annexin a3 was significantly upregulated in lnm adc compared with nonlnm adc immunohistochemistry also showed that annexin a3 overexpression was frequently observed in lnm adcs and matched lymph node metastases compared with that of nonlnm adcs these data indicated that annexin a3 might serve as a novel biomarker for lymph node metastasis and prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma liu et al 2009 comparative proteome analysis on 20 human lung squamous carcinoma hlsc tissues and paired normal bronchial epithelial tissues revealed 76 differential proteins among which 68 proteins were identified by pmf serological proteome analysis of 10 hlsc tissues was performed to identify the tumorassociated antigens the results revealed 36  8 differential proteins reactive with patients autologous sera of which 14 proteins were identified six of the 14 proteins alpha enolase preb cellenhancing factor precursor triosephosphate isomerase phosphoglycerate mutase 1 fructosebisphosphate aldolase a and guanine nucleotidebinding protein beta subunitlike protein were upregulated in hlscs indicating potential application of these 6 hlscassociated antigens in diagnosis and therapy of hlsc li et al 2006 in another study the authors investigated the distribution and expression of various prx isoforms in lung cancer and compared this with normal lung from human and mouse among the prx isoforms immunohistochemical staining showed the isoforms prx i ii iii and v were predominantly expressed in bronchial and alveolar epithelium as well as in alveolar macrophages of the normal mouse lung the isoforms i and iii were overexpressed in lung cancer tissues compared with normal lungs the upregulation of prx i and prx iii in lung cancer tissue may be advantageous for tumor cells to survive in this oxidative stress microenvironment park et al 2006 using tobacco carcinogen nicotinederived nitrosamine 4nmethylnnitrosamino13pyridyl1butanone nnk hamster pulmonary adenocarinoma pac model and human pac tissue arrays with matched and unmatched normal lung tissues it was shown that raf1 an effector of the egfr and phosphorylated creb an effector of the adrenoreceptor were overexpressed in a significant subset of human pacs and could be served as early biomarkers of pac development cekanova et al 2007 by proteomic analysis of urine samples from 10 healthy donors and 5 lung cancer patients with nsclc adenocarcinoma cell type some interesting biomarkers such as cd59 glycoprotein transthyretin gm2 activator protein gm2ap and igfree light chain were found to be differentially expressed tantipaiboonwong et al 2005 using a panel of serum biomarkers for the diagnosis of lung cancer it was found that carcinoembryonic antigen retinol binding protein 1antitrypsin and scc antigen were collectively found to correctly classify the majority of lung cancer and control patients patz et al 2007besides biopsies several proteomic studies on various lung cancer cell lines were performed comparative expression proteomic analysis on human normal beas2b and malignant a549 lung epithelial cells found that aldehyde dehydrogenase prx i fatty acid binding protein aldoketoreductase and destrin were upregulated whereas galectin1 transgelin and stathmin were downregulated an augmented expression of prx i was confirmed in cancer tissues compared with normal tissues from lung cancer patients suggesting that it could be a potential biomarker of lung cancer chang et al 2001 mbe a sv40ttransformed human bronchial epithelial cell line with the phenotypic features of early tumorigenesis at high passage was cultured in the conditioned media to collect its secretory proteins cathepsin d was found to be increased either in culture media or in cells during passaging tissue microarray and sandwich elisa analyses also validated significantly higher levels of cathepsin d in scc tissues as well as in plasma of lung squamous cell carcinoma patients respectively as compared with normal donors indicating a potential role as a biomarker for lung cancer lou et al 2007 similarly using nsclc cell line a549 14 proteins were found to be secreted in the conditioned medium including peptidylprolyl cistrans isomerase a manganese superoxide dismutase prx i phosphatidylethanolaminebinding protein glutathione stransferase p ubiquitin carboxylterminal hydrolase isozyme l1 pgp95 alpha enolase phosphoglycerate mutase 1 galectin1 and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase ddh compared with normal lung tissues higher ddh mrna and protein expression levels were found in 15 nsclc tissues concurrently serum level of ddh was significantly higher in nsclc patients than nonmalignant lung tumor and healthy controls these data suggested that ddh could be served as a tissue marker and a novel serological marker of nsclc huang et al 2006 further protein profiles of four different human nsclc cell lines were compared with normal human bronchial epithelial cells using 2de and malditofms among the protein identified tumor suppressor gene 1433 was downregulated whereas the protooncogene translation elongation factor 1 was upregulated in nsclc cell lines these proteins may be shared among these nsclc cell lines and closely tied in lung carcinogenesis liu et al 2004 finally to determine the metastasisassociated proteins in nsclc comparative proteomic analysis was performed of two nsclc cell lines with different metastatic potentials the nonmetastatic cl10 and highly metastatic cl15 cell lines results indicated that the upregulation of s100a11 expression in nsclc tissues was significantly associated with higher tumornodemetastasis stage and positive lymph node status indicating that s100a11 might be an important regulatory molecule in promoting invasion and metastasis of nsclc tian et al 2007from this review we summarized panels of biomarkers among most commonly contracted lungrelated diseases in the world we forecast that the emergence of further stateoftheart and cuttingedge technologies from proteomics will reveal the molecular basis and novel insights into various lungrelated diseases and complications however for the betterment of human life much effort are needed to validate whether these biomarkers and drug targets are really useful in early detection prediction and so are prevention and cure of lung diseases thus only through the successful production of reliable diagnostic kits and targeted drugs could prove the real value of all these studies that is the era of lung proteomics is on its waysepsis is one of the leading fatal causes of critical injured and ill patients all over the world despite recent advances in comprehensive management of trauma patients sepsis is still a life-threatening condition with poor outcome the risk factors of patients for the development of sepsis usually refer to their physiological characteristics underlying illnesses and clinical treatment backgrounds the patients with one or more of these factors are susceptible to sepsis the most vulnerable populations for sepsis are the elderly and infants patients with chronic diseases patients with severe trauma and burns those who are immunocompromised or receiving immunosuppressive therapy and malnourished and debilitated patients early diagnosis of sepsis plays a significant role for each hour of delay of appropriate antibiotic therapy increases mortality by 76  1 however the accurate and timely detection of sepsis remains a great challenge nowadays because of the various insidious and nonspecific clinical manifestations as well as the complex and indeterminate pathophysiologic process therefore neither the clinical microbiological detection which is known as the golden standard of infection nor the most traditional biomarkers can fulfill all the existing needs in the early diagnosis and management of sepsis 2originally sepsis has been defined as infection with at least 2 of the 4 sirs criteria which mainly focus on inflammation that is not covered the full pathobiology sepsis is now recognized to involve early activation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses along with major modifications in nonimmunologic pathways such as cardiovascular neuronal autonomic hormonal bioenergetic metabolic and coagulation all of which have prognostic significance 3 sepsis is refined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection 3 there is an extensive and complicated pathogen-host interaction during the process of infection sepsis develops when the initial appropriate host response to pathogens becomes amplified and then dysregulated 4 it is the ability of host immunologic defense that determines the fate of infecting organisms whether be localized phagocytized and erased by immunocytes which may cause the release of their components from the invading pathogens or multiply in the local tissues successfully leak into the bloodstream and eventually become bacteremia and sepsis pathogen itself and its structural components not only cause extensive changes of both innate and acquired immunities but also exert a profound influence on the systems of nerve endocrine respiration circulation and metabolism etc 4 traditional biomarkers of sepsis are mainly derived from this host immuno-inflammatory response the emergence and development of a variety of high throughput omics technologies will contribute to a more comprehensive screening for sepsis-specific biomarkers based on the discussion of current traditional sepsis biomarkers we address new insights into sepsis biomarkers in the field of genomics transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics those may show the hope for more comprehensive understanding of sepsis and help to overcome the present diagnostic uncertaintybiomarkers are molecular indicators that help doctors diagnose illnesses predict the outcome or identify which people are susceptible biomarkers should be some quantifiable measurements of biological homeostasis and by defining the normal status can provide a frame of reference for predicting abnormal or pathogenic processes 2 and make an impact on clinical decision making in time most commonly proposed sepsis and infection biomarkers including c-reactive protein crp procalcitonin pct 5 6 cytokines tnf- il-1 il-6 il-10 osteopontin 7 8 chemokines macrophage migration inhibitory factor mif high-mobility-group box 1 hmgb1 9 10 soluble receptor soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 strem-1 soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor supar 11 12 etcgiven the complicated pathophysiology in sepsis which involves hundreds of mediators or single molecules it is unlikely to identify one single biomarker which is able to satisfy all the existing needs and expectations in sepsis research and management crp for example is frequently used to assess the presence of infection and sepsis 2 and there is a positive correlation between its plasma level and the risk of organ dysfunction and death 13 14 however plasma concentrations of crp may increase during minor infection and do not adequately reflect the severity of infection or remain at a high level for several days even overstay the infection 2 besides crp may experience an increase during the inflammation caused by noninfectious etiologies such as tumor tissue necrosis or operation which explains its nonspecificity as an early stage sepsis biomarker meanwhile pct perceived as the most potential biomarker is listed as one of the diagnostic criteria for sepsis 15 a recent meta-analysis of pct that included 30 studies found mean sensitivity and specificity of 077 and 079 respectively with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc was 085 16 although pct was thought as a helpful biomarker for early diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill patients it was not suitable to be recommended as the single definitive diagnostic test 16therefore some researchers have put forward that combinations of biomarkers may overcome the limitations mentioned above in a prospective cohort study including 151 patients with systemic inflammatory responsesyndrome sirs kofoed et al 17 found that the aucs of six biomarkerssupar 05 strem-1 061 mif 063 pct 072 neutrophil count 074 crp 081for detection of a bacterial cause of inflammation had ranged from 05 to 081 with method reported by xiong et al 18 which discussed the statistical estimation of the optimum linear combination test and the associated maximum area under the roc curve kofoed got the combined auc of the six-marker test at 088 consequently the six-marker test had a better diagnostic accuracy in detecting bacterial versus nonbacterial causes of inflammation and significantly greater than that of each single marker similarly in another prospective research among the critically ill patients 19 a bioscore combining the polymorphonuclear neutrophil pmn cd64 index together with pct and strem-1 serum levels was put forward to diagnose sepsis and had a better performance with an auc of 097 than that of each individual biomarker and was externally confirmed in the validation cohort with 909  of patients being correctly classified by the very model although the combination of biomarkers do improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity due to the factors of time-consuming economic cost the amount of sample the feasibility of biomarkerdetection method and so on it has a limited application in clinical practice and still needs further prospective studies conducted in multicenter on cost-effectivenesscirculating dna including nuclear dna ndna and mitochondrial dna mtdna can either actively release or be released passively into the blood stream after rupture or necrosis of host cells 20 21 these nucleic acids released in the plasma during sepsis could serve as danger associated molecular patterns damps 22 which make them potential biomarkers for the very condition 23 24 a clinical study 22 found that plasma cytokine concentrations as well as ndna and mtdna levels of septic shockpatients were increased at the onset of septic shock and remained elevated and during the first 5 days of septic shock ndna levels consistently correlated with plasma cytokine concentrations as well as with the shock-related parameter norepinephrine infusion rate and markers of organ damage total bilirubin and creatinine these findings not only indicate a relationship between plasma ndna levels and the inflammatory response but also demonstrate that ndna levels are associated with markers of shock and organ damage in septic shock patientsa gene polymorphism is defined as regular occurrence 1  of two or more alleles at a particular chromosome location several polymorphisms of genes broadly involved in inflammation immunity and coagulation have been linked with susceptibility to sepsis or outcome of sepsis 25 and have become the focus of most gene association studies of sepsis as well snp the most common type of polymorphisms is a substitution deletion or insertion of a single nucleotide occurring in approximately 1 per 1000 base pairs of human dna snp can lead to an altered protein a change in the amount of normal protein expression or no discernible change in protein function 28 study of snp genotypes in sepsis helps identify potential markers of susceptibility severity and clinical outcomeextensive researches on snp genotyping of main genes cd14 2932 toll like receptors tlrs 27 33 lipopolysaccharide-binding protein lbp 34 cytokines 26 33 35 36 and coagulation factors 37 38have provided valuable information for sepsis for example burn patients with tlr4 and tnf- polymorphisms were 18 times more likely to develop severe sepsis but none of them were significantly associated with mortality 33 tlr1 snps are associated with increased mortality in patients with gram-positive sepsis after traumatic injury which may represent a novel marker of risk for death in critically injured patients 27 and most recently it was found that there was a new association between vascular endothelial growth factor vegf 936 cc genotype and the risk to develop acute kidney injury aki in severe sepsis patients 35 genome-wide snp genotyping assays allow to detect hundreds of thousands of snps accurately in a single experiment 39 40 and are expected to be of great applicative prospect in finding novel sepsis susceptibility-associated snp genotypesin order to evaluate the validity of these studies and translate this concept to the bedside several important factors have to be kept in mind potential confounding variables should be recognized and matched positive association studies and replicate studies should be validated and analyzed on the basis of the primary hypothesis other than multiple comparisons large scale collaborations and studies on sepsis susceptibility-associated snp genotypes need to be performed for the sake of possible new risk factors at the genetic backgrounds of sepsis development 25 41genes concerning immunity and inflammation are subject to epigenetic regulation 25 which refers to heritable changes in gene expression that are not related to direct dna sequence changes 42 dna methylation and histone post-translational modifications play vital roles in the epigenetic control 43 and gene expression and strongly impact on the host defense responsessepsis induces epigenetic changes in dendritic cells and lymphocytes rendering the host immune deficiency for a long period after the initial sepsis challenge 4446 late-phase immunosuppression of sepsis is strengthened by a postmortem study 47 by suppression of proinflammatory gene products and subsequent immune cell activation and proliferation epigenetic mechanisms are put forward to have an influence on the very stage of sepsis which may not only provide a better understanding of septic mechanism but also yield important biomarkers 48dna methylation the addition of methyl group to cytosine or adenine nucleotide is now replacing the biological markers with their high specificity sensitivity and prognostic efficacy a retrospective investigation has showed that calcitonin-related polypeptide  calca gene promoter methylation varied with different types of preterm bacterial sepsis 49 based on this finding another study demonstrated that global dna methylation varied significantly among newborns with sepsis and those without sepsis 50 more specifically a recent study analyzed the cpg methylation status in the epigenome of septic and non-septic babies 51 or icu patients 52 given biological and clinical significance they found 81 differentially methylated cpgs located in 64 genes and a panel of differentially methylated protocadherin  pcdhb genes that play vital role in leukocyte cell adhesion and wnt signaling pathway these genes play vital role in calcium dependent cell to cell adhesion and other immunological processes like antigen processing and presentation in sepsis suppression of leukocyte cell adhesion and migration may exaggerate disease severity and poor outcome due to multiple organ dysfunctions therefore this study provides some novel insights into the role of dna methylation in neonatal sepsis however further studies are called for exploring the clinical relevance as well as related therapeutic approaches of the observed findingsall the above mentioned sepsis biomarkers are derived from the development of genomics technology and summarized in table 1
the immune responses involved in sepsisare so complicated that the exact molecular mechanism remains to be fully elucidated 53 the balance between pro-inflammatory responses and anti-inflammatory responsesis closely related to the expression and regulation of relevant genes 54 hence evaluating the key gene expression profiles by high throughput dna chip may reveal the immune status of septic patients researchers have found specific changes of gene expression with microarray in certain organs and tissues of septic mice model which including heart 55 liver spleen 56 leucocytes 57 and so onaccordingly lukaszewsk recruited 92 icu patients who had the risk of developing into sepsis 58 the mrna expression levels of il-1 il-6 il-8 il-10 tnf-a fasl and ccl2 in their blood leukocytes were measured on a daily basis by means of real-time reverse transcription pcr rt-pcr and analyzed with a nonlinear technique neural network analysis the data correctly predict the onset of sepsis in an average of 8309  of patient cases between 1 and 4 days before clinical diagnosis with high sensitivity and selectivity 9143 and 8020  respectively sutherland et al 59 evaluated transcriptional profiles in circulating white blood cells of icu sepsis patients post-surgical patients and healthy controls with a microarray and multiplex tandem mt-pcr a panel of 42-gene expression markers was identified by which the prediction of sepsiswithin a mixed inflammatory population had an auc between 86 and 92  sepsis has a unique gene expression profile that is different from uninfected inflammation and becomes apparent prior to the clinical manifestations of sepsis for 048 h 60 in that case the specific gene expression profile which may involve the function of innate immunity cytokine receptors t cell differentiation as well as the protein synthesis may make a reference for early diagnosis of sepsishowever an important limitation of transcriptomics is that it only partially reflects the steady-state mrna abundance and the degree of mrna abundance is influenced by multiple factors and does not provide any direct information about gene end products proteins nor post-translational modifiers of protein function 61 when it comes to the sample used as rna source there is a contradiction for the whole blood approach it may be difficult to interpret the confounded data of rna for the reason of the heterogeneity among blood cell populations as for the cell-specific approach there is a possibility to miss relevant expression information from other cells due to the complexity of clinical sepsis 61 it highlights the necessity of linking theory to clinical practicemicrornas mirnas is a class of short rnas with 1825 nucleotides in length which regulate gene expression in a post-transcriptional manner via sequence-specific interaction with target sites in mrna 62 associated with various physiological and pathological processes the levels of mirna in serum and plasma are consistent among individuals of the same species resistant to rnase a digestion and stable even after the freeze-and-thaw and a long term of storage 63 64 the stability of mirna makes it a potentially useful candidate for diagnostic and other clinical applications although the source of circulating mirna is still unclear it has been proved that there is a link among a range of diseases such as circulating mirna and cancer 65 66 trauma 67 68 acute pancreatitis 69 and hepatitis 70when it comes to sepsis by using genome-wide mirna profiling with microarray in peripheral blood leukocytes and quantitative rt-pcr vasilescu 71 found that mir-150 levels were significantly reduced in both leukocytes and plasma of sepsis patients and had a negative correlation with the level of disease severity measured by the sequential organ failure assessment sofa score which made it a biomarkerof early sepsis similarly zeng 72 73 investigated the levels of mir-150 and mir-143 in peripheral blood leukocytes in sepsis patients with rt-pcr and found that the expression levels of mir-150 and mir-143 were significantly decreased in sepsis patients and could reflect the severity of sepsis in certain degree which not only made it a marker to reflect the situation of inflammatory response but also made it a prognostic marker in sepsis recently higher serum mir-133a levels were found among sepsis patients in icu 74 as they were significantly correlated with disease severity classical markers of inflammation and bacterial infection as well as organ failure high mir-133a levels were considered as independent biomarkers for unfavorable prognosis of critically ill patientshowever given that the pathophysiological process of sepsis involves a variety of tissues and organs a simple screen for mirna differentially expressed in leukocytes may omit those secreted by other cells wang et al 75 used genome-wide microarray to identify differential serum mirnas in survival and non-survival sepsis patients and then further validated the differential expressions of mir-297 and mir-574-5p by rt-pcr in a larger group the serum mir-574-5p together with sepsis stage and sepsis-related organ failure assessment scores has a better predictive capability for the death of sepsis patients in addition serum mir-146a and mir-223 were found significantly reduced in septic patients compared with sirs patients and healthy controls which might serve as new biomarkers for sepsis with high specificity and sensitivity 76 due to our knowledge on serum mirnas is still at a primary stage the expression level of circulating mirnas at different stages of sepsis and their potential correlation with injured organs need further investigationto sum up from the point of view of gene transcription mirna may undertake the task of diagnosing sepsis in an early stage and evaluating the prognosis as well as becoming the new target for sepsis therapyas discussed above epigenetic factors not only include histone modifications and dna methylation but also contain non-coding rnasncrnas which have diverse size and can be generated from intergenic regions introns or enhancers 45 lncrnas are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides and lack protein-coding capacity peng et al 77 first discovered the widespread differential expression of lncrnas in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov virus infection accordingly there is a possible link between lncrnas and the host defense response against infection lncrna has the potential to become new class of biomarkers and new therapeutic target for infectious diseases however as the functions of lncrnas remain largely unexplored there is a need for future studies on their regulatory role in infectionall the transcriptomics-based biomarkers mentioned above are outlined in table 2
proteome is the complete set of proteins that can be expressed by the genetic material of an organism proteomics is the analysis of the expression localizations functions and interactions of proteomes compared to other immunologic tests proteomics is a novel method with advantages of high throughput high sensitivity and specificity the development of proteomics has allowed for a better understanding of the molecular bases concerning the identification of cell signaling modifying protein post-translation modification pathway as well as the characterization of specific biological markers 78proteomics has irreplaceable clinical significance and an expansive application prospect in studies of sepsis biomarkers in a rabbit sepsis model by intravenous injection of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 24 h after scald 11 discrepant expression proteins from lymphocyte were found by matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization time of flight mass spectrometrymaldi-tof ms they are related with the folding assembling transportation and degradation of proteins signal transmission inflammation immunization energy metabolism the proliferation differentiation and apoptosisof cells 79 in a recent research 41 differential expressed proteins in the neutrophils from acinetobacter baumannii sepsis rats were identified using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry 80 they included antioxidant proteins signaling proteins cytoskeleton and regulatory proteins energy metabolism and protease protein which may play a key role in such kind of sepsis and provide potential clues in early diagnosis and treatment of sepsisin clinic ykl-40 was identified with proteomics analysis on a significantly higher expression level in serum samples from sepsis patients and considered as a possible biomarker of sepsis 81 paugam-burtz et al 82 used plasma profiling coupling proteinchip array with surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-fly mass spectrometry seldi-tof ms to analyze the plasma of postoperative patients and found that a combination of five plasma protein peaks may have potential as diagnostic biomarkers of postoperative sepsis in patients undergoing liver transplantation even so these proteins remain to be identified and validated in more clinical trialsalthough many potential sepsis biomarkershave been revealed by genomics transcriptomics and proteomics the changes of cellular metabolism in sepsis should be paid attention metabolomics is an emerging omics technologyfollowing genomics and proteomics and focuses on the metabolic products with a molecular weight less than 1000 kd under the physiological or pathological status it can analyze the biochemical events of cells tissues or organs and evaluate the disease and its severity the research methods of metabolomics mainly include nuclear magnetic resonance nmr gas chromatographymass spectra gcms high performance liquid chromatographymass spectra hplcmsthe development of sepsis involves the reactions of multiple systems on various levels which has a significant influence on the expression levels and activities of metabolic enzymes and by detecting the concentration and ratio changes of those metabolites involved a better understanding of condition and prognosis of sepsismay be achieved at an early stage 83 metabolic profile of the serum from septic rats with cecal ligation and puncture was achieved with the help of nmr and lcms 83 in the septic rats especially the non-survivors many free fatty acids showed a lower level which may be consumed greatly for energy supply in sepsis and may be related with the prognosis of sepsis moreover there was a rise of some polyunsaturated fatty acids in the very group which may have a relationship with the increased anti-inflammatory effect based on the metabolic profile analysis a model for outcome predication was built with high sensitivity and specificity which provided a novel method for sepsis prognosis judgment nmr-based metabolic profiling revealed the difference of metabolites of energy metabolism and inflammation in lung tissue bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid and serum samples between the septic rat and the control rat 84 in septic rats creatine concentration increased in all the three types of samples whereas alanine and phosphoethanolamine concentrations increased only both in lung tissue and in serum myoinositol increased in lung tissue but decreased in bal fluid in addition acetoacetate increased whereas formate decreased in serum and with the construction of a predictive model for diagnosis of sepsis using partial least-squares discriminant analysis the preliminary goal of sepsis diagnosis was achievedthe possible sepsis biomarkers screened out from the application of proteomics and metabolomics technologies are summarized in table 3
sepsis involves sophisticated pathophysiologic changes among various organs and different systems so that comprehensively identifying sepsis biomarkers and understanding sepsis molecular mechanism from the perspectives of omics may provide valuable information about a more macroscopical and authentic state following infectionthe most important issue involved in the researches of sepsis biomarkers is the criteria of septic cases the golden standard of infection currently still depends on the results of clinical microbiology laboratory which however due to the severity of the disease the load and type or growth capacity of pathogens and the use of antibiotic treatment may show a negative result while patients has clinical manifestation of infection 85 or false positive results may present for the reason of contamination therefore whether this gold standard is appropriate in sepsis needs further reflection and investigationthere is a lack of effective and united assessment methods for sepsis biomarkers especially in the multi-centered or multi-index researches valid evaluation needs to be performed to pick out the ideal diagnostic indicators those both of high sensitivity and specificity in the field of data statistics and of great practical use in clinical practicemajority studies of sepsis only focus on a single set of omics technologytable 1 rather than apply the combination of multiple omics approaches since different omics may display sepsis mechanism at various levels of a specific molecule or a particular group of sepsis-associated molecules the comprehensive application of two or more omics may provide integrated information of potential sepsis biomarkers mapit algorithm multi analyte pathway inference tool for example enables principled integration of epigenomics transcriptomics and proteomics data for cancer diagnosis prognosis and biomarker discovery 86last but not the least as mentioned above the lack of a clear insight of the pathophysiology of sepsis process will to some extent put off the sepsis biomarker researches 2 but with the application of state-of-art technology and exploration in a novel view the progress in sepsis biomarkerswill promote awareness and understanding of sepsis
scientific advancements over the previous 2 decades have enabled the sensitive detection and characterization of bacterial and viral nucleic acids amplification technologies eg polymerase chain reaction pcr nucleic acid sequencebased amplification nasba allow for specific detection of genetic targets furthermore technological improvements in sequence determination systems allow for organisms to be fully characterized as to genotype subtype variant mutants and resistance patternsfor the veterinary clinical laboratory commercially standardized assays are not readily available most laboratories offering nucleic amplification tests natbased diagnostics use methods developed in-house or those adapted from research publications there is no standardization among these in-house assays or an official regulatory body to monitor quality assurance differences in laboratory experience and technique primer and probe combinations methods of nucleic acid isolation and control standards contribute to the reproducibility and variability observed among laboratories1
assays must be precise and reproducible and have positive and negative controls in place to prevent invalid test results it is also recommended that these assays have an internal control to validate nucleic acid isolation and to test for amplification inhibitorsin a blind study veterinary laboratories offering nat diagnostics for psittacine circovirus were evaluated3 the findings of this investigation revealed that accuracy was 100 for 2 laboratories 95 for 2 laboratories and 71 for 1 laboratory whereas 1 laboratory had a test specificity of 203 the authors concluded that although results from most laboratories were accurate both false-positive and false-negative results were reported by at least 2 laboratories they also concluded that 1 laboratory may be generating large numbers of falsely reported results veterinarians must realize that the accuracy of results depends completely on the accuracy of the operating standards of the individual laboratory laboratories should always strive for the highest standards of assay precision differences in assay precision make it difficult to compare data from different laboratories without defined standardsanother consideration in nat-based diagnostics concerns sample quality preservation of sample integrity is essential for accurate test results especially if detection or quantification of rna is desired unlike dna rna is unstable and is readily degraded by naturally occurring endonucleases rnases that are present in the environment and tissues samples for rna testing should be handled with gloves to prevent contamination with rnases present on the skin samples for rna testing should be promptly submitted to the laboratory or stored in a freezer at 80c until forwarded for testing samples may also be treated with buffers designed to minimize rna degradation with several commercial additives being available for this purpose but their use varies among laboratories it is best to consult the specific laboratory for their protocol for sample submission although dna tends to be more stable than rna naturally occurring endonucleases that degrade dna do exist test samples should be aseptically collected and refrigerated or frozen until submission the ability of pcr to detect extremely low levels of dna in a submitted patient sample results in the very real potential of false-positive test results due to dna contaminationpcr is a technique that started as a research tool and was eventually integrated into medical diagnostic applications in 1971 kleppe demonstrated that dna could be artificially replicated in vitro with a dna polymerase enzyme4 combined with methods allowing for the synthesis of dna oligonucleotides kary mullis developed the technique of pcr in 1983 and won the nobel prize in chemistry for his work5
pcr has become one of the most widely used technologies in veterinary research and molecular diagnostics of infectious disease the wide range of applications include the detection of dna or rna derived from infectious bacterial viral mycoplasmal parasitic protozoal or fungal organisms evaluation of specific genetic defects and quantization of cytokines and cellular growth factors pcr testing can be used on a wide range of samples including tissue from biopsies or necropsies blood feces tissue soil cerebrospinal fluid and swabs of mucosal surfacespcr uses the highly specific molecular recognition ability of watson-crick base pairing to provide the selectivity needed for a nucleic acid probe to bind to a targeted dna sequence and allow for its exponential amplification specific fragments of dna are replicated by cyclical heating and cooling through repeated temperature stages in a thermal cycler unit fig 1 each cycle can double the amount of existing target dna repeatedly amplifying the target sequence over 30 to 40 cycles theoretically allows for millions 230 of dna copies to be produced pcr assays are thus extremely sensitive they are capable of detecting femtograms 1015g of target dna sequence in a large mixture or up to a microgram 106 g of nontarget dna the dna obtained at the end of the reaction can be used for a variety of applications including sequencing cloning or as a probe for in situ hybridizationthe nested pcr consists of 2 sequential pcr amplifications the product from the first-round pcr is used as the template for a second pcr amplification a second set of primers internal to the first set amplify a smaller fragment of dna within the first-round product in regular pcr primers may bind to incorrect regions of the dna giving unexpected amplification products the benefit of nested pcr is that increased specificity is achieved through confirmation of the correct primer binding during the first pcr amplification process the nested pcr is more sensitive than conventional single-round qualitative pcrthe implementation of nucleic acid technology into routine diagnostics has greatly advanced with the introduction of real-time pcr1 real-time pcr amplification uses the detection and quantification of a fluorescent reporter molecule whose signal increases in proportion to the amount of target amplification product generated basic methods involve the detection of a dna-binding dye such as sybr green molecular probes eugene or usa the dye intercalates between double-stranded dna formed in the pcr reaction and when exposed to an excitation source fluoresces a laser scanner detects the fluorescence emitted by dye-impregnated dna strands formed through the pcr amplification software traces this fluorescence as a running graph as the amplification reaction in real time fig 2
a more specific strategy for real-time assays includes the use of a confirmatory probe sequence that matches part of the amplification product these real-time amplicon detection technologies include taqman applied biosystems inc foster city ca usa or hydrolysis probes6 molecular beacon technology7 and hybridization probes8 fluorescence is only detected if the probe is bound to the amplified target thereby enhancing specificity to an already highly specific assay these probes do not react with primer-dimers or other nonspecific products that may be generated during the pcr reaction as may occur with sybr green reactions however a well-designed and optimized sybr green amplification is a very effective testing technology unlike taqman probes the sybr green reporter remains intact so a melt curve analysis can be performed on the amplification product melt curve analysis measures the dissociation characteristics of double-stranded dna during heating melt curve analysis is sensitive enough to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms snp and can distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous gene alleles by the dissociation patterns produced fig 3 the advancement of this technology to produce high-resolution melt analysis will provide higher sensitivity for snp detection within entire dye-stained amplicons for genomic analysisthe main advantage of real-time detection is that it accurately quantifies the number of rna or dna copies present in the test sample real-time technologies can measure dna presence over a large dynamic range providing important information regarding the magnitude of viral involvement within a test sample this information is helpful in distinguishing clinically active infections from transient environmental exposures quantification also aids in the treatment of patients with chronic infectious disease and monitoring disease progression and resolution9
standard pcr techniques cannot be used to detect the presence of rna-based viruses in clinical samples the direct amplification of rna in pcr systems is not possible because of the polymerase enzymes inability to synthesize dna from an rna template the inability to synthesize dna from an rna template is overcome by the use of a reverse-transcriptase rt enzyme before the pcr reaction in rt-pcr rna is converted into a complementary dna cdna strand by an rna-dependent dna polymerase reverse transcriptase the cdna produced is then used as a template in a conventional pcr reaction it is important that all genomic dna within the test sample be destroyed before the rt-pcr to prevent masking the presence of cdna derived from the rt stepin addition to diagnosing rna viral infections in an individual patient rt-pcr has been applied to monitoring disease in flocks and large groups of animals environmental air-sampling referred to as sniffing was paired with real-time rt-pcr to detect exotic newcastle disease virus in commercial poultry operations in 200310 the same approach was successfully used to detect h6n2 influenza in commercial quail this methodology offers the advantage of detecting virus in contaminated environments by collecting airborne particulates including virus comingled with dust and debris without having to handle individual birdspcr currently is still the main target amplification technique used in both research and diagnostic laboratories a second target amplification technique known as nasba was specifically developed for the quantitative amplification of rna targets such as retroviruses and other rna viruses11 12 nasbas main advantage is that it works at isothermic conditions and can give quicker and more sensitive results than pcr it has been used to develop rapid diagnostic tests for several pathogenic viruses with single-stranded rna genomes including influenza a13 foot-and-mouth disease virus14 and severe acute respiratory syndrome sarsassociated coronavirus15
loop-mediated isothermal pcr lamp is a 1-step amplification reaction that amplifies a target dna sequence with high sensitivity and specificity under isothermal conditions lamp uses a dna polymerase with inner and outer primers that recognizes 6 separate regions within a target dna sequence the assay has high specificity because the amplification reaction only occurs when all 6 regions within the target dna are correctly recognized by the primers9 lamp exhibits less sensitivity to inhibitory substances present in biological samples than regular pcrlamp has been applied to pathogens that cause food-borne diseases testing kits that use this technology are commercially available for detecting salmonella spp legionella spp listeria spp verotoxin-producing escherichia coli and campylobacter sppmany amplification methods including pcr ligase chain reaction nasba and strand displacement amplification are used in commercially available diagnostic test kits these diagnostic test kits are promoted as providing a rapid sensitive and specific detection of important pathogens especially those that are not readily identified by more conventional methods conventional detection and identification of noroviruses are performed by electron microscopy which is less sensitive and more time consuming than nat diagnosticsmolecular-based testing for multiple pathogens in a large number of animals is expensive the development of new variations of pcr have allowed for simultaneously performing multiple tests on a single diagnostic sample thereby affording some savings on a per-test basis in multiplex pcr multiple primer pairs are used to amplify more than one gene or pathogen in a single pcr reaction multiplex assays must be carefully designed for specific primer selection primers selected must be to regions that are uniquely different and characterized by low affinity for primer-to-primer interactionsnucleic amplification technologies will continue to be a benchmark for pathogen detection in veterinary diagnostics currently there are 3542 reference sequences for 2416 viral genomes and 40 reference sequences for viroids in genbank an open-access public database of nucleotide reference sequences httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgenomesvirusesviruseshtmlthe exponential replication of dna afforded by the pcr process allows for excellent diagnostic sensitivity and specificity however the instability and variability inherent in molecular enzymatic processes limit the application of this technology outside an institutional setting to a research facility or dedicated molecular laboratory new technologies such as the lab-on-a-chip have been developed and have potential in veterinary point-of-care diagnostics defined as a miniaturized analytical laboratory constructed on a small chip this technology has promising applications when combined with nat diagnostic processes both pcr and lamp assays have been used to facilitate the development of lab-on-a-chipbased nat devices16 such devices can offer molecular-based testing in a rapid effective low-cost and disposable automatic format as a point-of-care diagnostic toola dna microarray is a miniaturized form of dot blot in a predefined ordered fashion at a high density17 it consists of an arrayed series of thousands of microscopic spots of dna oligonucleotides each containing picomoles 1012 moles of a specific dna sequence the dna spots gene chips are attached in an equidistant ordered arrangement to a solid surface such as a glass plastic or silicon chip alternative microarray platforms include polyacrylamide gel pads microsphere beads 3-dimensional films and solid-state electronics18 microarrays may have from a hundred to thousands of test sites that can range in size from 10 to 500 m dna arrays are different from other types of microarrays only because they either measure dna or use dna as part of the detection systemhybridization is performed with corresponding probes attached to the solid support these can be cdnas oligonucleotides of varying length or genomic sequences that are either radioactively or fluorescently labeled artificial single-stranded dna or rna ligands short oligonucleotides or peptide molecules that can be generated against amino acids drugs proteins and other molecules are called aptamers19 aptamers bind to a specific target molecule with high affinity and selectivity ranging from the micromolar to the nanomolar level and they can discriminate between closely related targets16 20 a high-density array can be generated by applying aptamers to the substrate with robotic pins or inkjet technology or by an in situ photolithographic synthesis process these techniques allow for the production of a high-density chip containing thousands of short probes targeted at different loci within a single gene or multiple genomes high-density microarrays may have up to 106 test sites in a 1  2 cm2 area17
the core principle of dna microarrays is based on hybridization probing the property of complementary nucleic acid sequences to specifically pair with each other by forming hydrogen bonds between nucleotide base pairs hybridization occurs between 2 cdna sequences such as the nucleic acid probes immobilized on the solid surface of a chip and the mobile dna cdna or messenger rna mrna sample a high number of complementary base pairs in a nucleotide sequence allows for tighter noncovalent bonding between the 2 strands to occur probe-target hybridization is usually quantified through the detection of a fluorophore silver or chemiluminescence-labeled target after the hybridization step is complete the microarray is scanned the fluorescent tags are excited by a laser read by a microscopic camera and computer integrated into a digital image of the array software analyzes each microarray spot calculating the red-to-green fluorescence ratio and subtracting out background data the nature and relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target are determined dna microarrays have been used for the detection of infectious and genetic disease cancer diagnostics and forensic and genetic identification purposes microarray systems are very definitive and highly scalable because hundreds to tens of thousands of possible dna elements can be interrogated in a single experimentexamination of animal and zoonotic pathogens typically focuses on 3 objectives 1 determining the presence or absence of a pathogen 2 determining pathogen viability and 3 enumerating the pathogenic agents of a specific disease dna microarrays are well suited for determining the presence or absence of specific pathogens dna microarrays also permit relatively rapid interrogation of a clinical sample against thousands of genetic targets allowing for simultaneous detection and discrimination among hundreds of pathogenic agents of veterinary interest18 however dna microarrays are not very useful in inferring pathogen viabilitythe first important step in microarray-based pathogen detection is probe selection and design many issues associated with probe design for dna microarrays can impact the overall fidelity of the assay and particularly the levels of specificity and sensitivity one of the first applications of a bacterial high-density dna probe array was for the diagnostic capability of identifying mycobacteria spp21 using rt-pcr and a dna microarray based on the mycobacterial heat shock protein this technology was used for the rapid identification of different mycobacterial species in mixed infections22 and array-based genotyping of mycobacterial organisms23 other applications to bacterial infections have included the diagnosis of salmonella spp escherichia coli o157h7 mycoplasma hyopneumoniae gene profiling of pasteurella multocida mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis spp rhodococcus equi borrelia burgdorferi staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin genes and clostridium perfringens toxin genes bacillus anthracis c perfringens brucella spp bordetella pertussis and b parapertussis and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae24
microarray technology has also been used to generate a lipopolysaccharide array against the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria monoclonal antibodies specific for escherichia coli o111 e coli o157 francisella tularensis and salmonella enteric serovar typhimurium o antigens were used to evaluate the assay the detection limit of antibodies was reported to be 10 ngml which is 100-fold more sensitive than conventional immunofluorescence assays24
the diagnosis of viral diseases requires the identification of the viral pathogen in the clinical sample and a subsequent correlation between the identified virus and the clinical disease conventional methods of viral detection include isolation and in vitro culture and immunological methods such as direct fluorescence antibody or enzyme immunoassay with some viral disease agents identification is readily accomplished other viruses eg norovirus however are refractory to in vitro culture immunological methods dependent on the quality and availability of antibodies may also be ineffective for identifying viruses with constantly evolving serotypes although pcr has revolutionized viral diagnostics by increasing detection sensitivity and specificity the maximum number of viruses detectable in a single assay is relatively small in diseases where different viruses are present or where no etiologic agent has been identified the value of these conventional methods may be limitedunlike pcr technology where the target agent must be known to use specific test primers microarrays can allow for the rapid diagnosis of multiple pathogenic agents in disease outbreaks and epidemics of unknown etiology one of the first studies in multiple pathogen detection used a microarray chip to discern 2 viral pathogens porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and foot and mouth disease virus25 the microarray detection device demonstrated rapid and accurate detection of these 2 specific viruses in another study a low-density microarray using 15 capture-oligonucleotides targeting the conserved influenza matrix gene accurately subtyped h1n1 h3n2 and h5n1 influenza a viruses in less than 12 hours26 27
researchers led by joseph derisi of the university of california at san francisco have combined genome databases of sequenced viruses with dna microarray technology28 using available sequence data from viral genomes they designed a long oligonucleotide viral microarray the microarray was capable of simultaneously detecting hundreds of viruses in a single clinical sample the approach used randomized primers in an rt-pcr to amplify any viral rna that was present in the clinical sample the pcr product was then hybridized to the microarray comprising 1600 probes representing nearly 140 respiratory virus genomes viruses that were represented on the microarray were readily detected and identified by specific hybridization to the appropriate oligonucleotides this methodology enabled the simultaneous detection of hundreds of viruses including essentially all respiratory tract viruses this microarray system greatly expanded the spectrum of detectable viruses in a single assay while simultaneously providing the capability to discriminate among viral subtypes similarly sengupta and colleagues developed microarrays with 476 probes to distinguish among various influenza viruses29
although initial efforts were focused on only a few hundred viruses derisi and colleagues devised a microarray representing all known human animal aquatic and plant viruses called the virochip the most highly conserved genomic sequences from within viral families were chosen for representation on the microarray viruses represented included double- and single-stranded dna viruses retroviruses and both positive- and negative-stranded rna viruses dna fragments of virtually every virus ever discovered about 22000 different viral sequences were represented on the virochipthe virochip greatly accelerates the ability of researchers to diagnose viral infections and identify new viral epidemics within a very short time this technology can help to rapidly identify known viruses and classify new ones based on their genetic makeup the virochip has been credited with the rapid recognition of a novel coronavirus in 2003 the etiologic agent responsible for sars30
although the virochip represents sequences from known referenced viruses equally important is its potential to facilitate viral discovery in diseases of unknown etiology as new viruses evolve they still maintain certain characteristic-conserved regions in the viral genome by using highly conserved sequences from all known viral taxonomy the virochip can identify similar sequences in previously unknown agents and newly evolved viruses within recognized familiesproventricular dilation disease pdd has been diagnosed in psittacine birds for the past 40 years but the underlying etiologic cause has not been identified although the disease exhibits characteristics of a viral infection and numerous viral etiologies have been proposed confirmation of a definitive agent remained elusive in 2008 kistler and coworkers used the virochip to interrogate samples from 2 pdd casecontrol series collected on 2 different continents31 tissues from birds with confirmed pdd displayed a novel bornavirus signature in 625 of the pdd cases and none of the control tissues the bornavirus-positive samples were further confirmed by virus-specific pcr testing and the complete genome sequenced currently 7 genotypes of the avian bornavirus have been identifiedmicroarray-based viral detection offers a powerful alternative for determination of viral subtypes classic serotyping of viruses is tedious and limited by availability of antisera conserved array elements are capable of broadly detecting many if not all viral serotypes unique hybridization patterns are often observed for different viral serotypes which enables rapid identificationbecause of the high resolution of microarray hybridization it will see future application in the study of viral pathogenesis and diagnosis of veterinary diseases microarray hybridization is a viable approach for detecting unsequenced or uncharacterized viruses and novel virus discovery it can be used to differentiate among viral subtypes and provide important information on how a new virus relates to those that have been classified application of this type of information can provide clues about viral origin and possible treatment strategies this comprehensive and unbiased analysis of viral prevalence in a given biological sample also increases the feasibility of introducing molecular testing for viruses that are easily detected using classical diagnostic testing methods1
when target nucleic acids are abundant then direct microarray interrogation of pathogen targets is achievable in the absence of amplification18 direct hybridization strategies involve extracting rna or dna from the sample and applying the material directly to a microarray without additional amplification direct hybridization provides the least bias in gene detection but also has the lowest level of analytical sensitivity another strategy bypasses these limitations and yields an extremely broad-reaching and unbiased detection strategy it uses microarrays composed of carefully selected viral sequences coupled to a random pcr amplification one approach is to amplify one or more universal genes eg 16s rrna 18s rrna 23s rrna genes and to screen for pathogen-specific polymorphisms greisen and coworkers were one of the first groups to amplify fragments of the 16s rrna gene using group-specific pcr primers and with southern blots that had pathogen-specific probes identified pathogenic bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid32 microarrays can be used in a similar fashion to interrogate pcr products to distinguish between multiple pathogens a second pcr strategy is to use multiplex pcr to amplify a number of discreet pathogen-specific genetic markers that are subsequently detected on a dna microarraysimultaneous detection of multiple pathogens should be viewed in the context of an entire analytical process that spans sample collection to final testing18 physical differences between target organisms often require very different strategies to extract nucleic acids for analysis after which the dna microarray can then serve as the actual detection devicethe reader is referred to the review by wang for an encompassing review of microarray technology33 in the area of microarrays for microbiological applications several general reviews are available specific reviews are available on dna microarray analyses of host-pathogen interactions34 and the use of microarrays for the molecular diagnosis of mycobacteria spp35 generalized reviews in the medical-related areas include microarrays for disease gene discovery36 microarrays in medicine37 and microarrays for molecular pathology38
early methods of dna sequencing determining the nucleotide order of a dna segment gene or genome were costly and slow although the first sequence of a human gene locus was published in 199039 it took 10 years to report the sequence of the entire human genome in 200040 the recent development of cost-effective high-throughput sequencing now allows for efficient full sequencing of an organisms genome as dna sequence data have become more available the field of comparative genomics has rapidly progressed attention has turned to generating whole genome assemblies and genomics resources for veterinary species in july 2005 a publicly accessible annotated genome assembly of the domestic dog41 and subsequently a draft sequence of the domestic cat42 43 were released with complete genome sequences now available for the dog cat and horse39 the tools are now available to research very specific questions about animal genomes and cancerdna microarrays have technologically advanced genomics research44 dna microarrays are used to detect dna or rna most commonly as cdna after rt and are referred to as gene expression analysis or expression profiling26 gene expression analysis is based on the assumption that cells react to changes in their environment by increasing or decreasing transcription of appropriate genes these changes in expression levels can be detected or quantified by using specific scientific methodology such as real-time rt-pcr and microarray technologythe use of a distinct dna array for gene expression profiling was first described in 1987 to identify genes whose expression was modulated by interferon45 determining the level or volume at which a certain gene is expressed is called microarray expression analysis miniaturized microarrays were first applied to expression profiling in 199546 in veterinary medicine genome libraries have allowed for the development of new high-density microarrays to facilitate whole genome and gene-targeted profiling at high resolution and throughput47 new high-density microarrays have rapidly advanced our knowledge and understanding of pet and food animal genomes and have fostered the development of a rapidly growing class of molecular diagnostics focused on diagnostic testing for genetic traits encoded by genomic dnascientists can use a microarray to examine the expression of hundreds or thousands of genes within a single sample in a single assay through computer analysis the amount of mrna bound to each site on the array is precisely measured generating a profile of global gene expression within the cell once researchers have characterized the expression patterns of various genes involved in many diseases the expression pattern of cdna from an individual can be hybridized to determine if it matches the expression pattern of a known disease if a gene is over expressed in a certain disease state then more sample cdna compared with control cdna is detected in microarray comparative genomic hybridization the increased or decreased expression of a particular genes is determined a change in the number of copies of a particular gene may correlate to a certain disease state microarrays may also be used in veterinary diagnostics by comparing gene expression of infected cells or tissues with that of uninfected cells or tissues expression profiling can also identify genes whose expression is changed in response to disease-causing agents48 revealing how multiple genes work together to produce physical and chemical responses and analysis of patterns of coordinated gene expression can help identify genes involved in the development of various diseasesa canine-specific microarray using mrna and expressed sequence tag sequences has been developed49 the elucidation of these biological networks eg disease development nutrition and identification of associated molecular mechanisms will allow for the development of more precise diagnostics for these processes49
dna microarrays can be designed specifically for genotyping thereby enabling them to measure single base pair changes at many thousands of points throughout a genome dna microarrays are useful for genotyping point mutations single nucleotide polymorphisms snps and short tandem repeats strs among alleles within or between populations50 snp technology has been diversely applied in areas such as analyzing forensics measuring disease predisposition evaluating germ line mutations in individuals and somatic mutations in neoplasias diagnosing infectious and genetic disease and diagnosing cancer once an snp pattern is associated with a particular disease snp microarrays can be used to test an individual for that disease expression pattern a determination can be made if the individual is susceptible or at risk of developing that specific disease conditionin sheep diagnostic microarrays are used to determine specific snps that predispose animals to scrapie a prion protein disease individuals with these snps accumulate the prion protein disease cellular protein within their central nervous system51
initial microarray platforms available for veterinary oncology were genomic and cdna microarrays generated by binding dna fragments onto a glass or silicon surface more recently high-density oligonucleotide arrays where short dna sequences are synthesized directly on the surface of a chip have allowed for thousands of features to be represented dna copy number variation gene expression levels and genetic alterations can be determined at a substantially increased resolutionhigh-density microarrays represent a powerful tool for comparative genomic studies microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization merges molecular diagnostics with traditional chromosome analysis52 53 applications for high-density microarrays have been extended to many areas of medicine and medical genetics54 new syndromes have been discovered and the phenotypes of existing disease conditions have been expandeda comparative study of canine chronic myelogenous leukemia showed that dogs diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia also present with a functionally active genetic translocation previously identified in humans55 this study resulted in the first molecular cytogenetic test for the presence of a clinically significant genomic alteration in a veterinary cancerseveral tests are now available for canine patients to identify oncogenes and clonal lymphocyte populations56 these tests can be placed into 3 broad categories 1 detection of individual mutations in oncogenes 2 detection of chromosomal translocations deletions and duplications and 3 detection of clonality in lymphoma and leukemia through unique antigen receptor genes of b- and t-cells each of these testing methods has been used in veterinary medicine on an experimental basis and is now being offered by several laboratories56
the original emphasis on microarrays was on dna technologies researchers have exploited the diversity of this technology to further extend applications to the development of protein antibody and carbohydrate microarrays macbeath and schreiber57 developed the first small-molecule microarray in 1999 and the first protein microarray in 2000 soon afterward other array types were developed such as cell arrays carbohydrate arrays and proteome arraysnewer microarray formats that developed at the turn of the 21st century provide a host of other biomolecules that can be presented on a chip including proteins eg whole proteomes enzymes antibodies58 59 small molecules eg drug-like molecules peptides carbohydrates60 61 and even whole cells and tissues for simultaneous multiplexed experimentation62
within the last decade protein microarrays have entered the field of proteomic research63 64 proteomics is the term used to describe the study of proteins expressed by a genome technologies that had previously been established for dna microarrays were adapted to the generation of protein arrays with glass slides being initially used as a solid support in planar microarrays bead arrays or liquid array systems rely on the use of different bead types that can be distinguished either by color size or shape currently protein microarrays are highly miniaturized and parallelized solid-phase assay systems that use a large number of different capture molecules immobilized in microspots protein microarray technology has enormous potential for in vitro diagnostics and disease monitoringprotein microarray technology has enormous potential for application within the veterinary diagnostic testing arena antibodies in an immunoassay format have been widely used and are well established as highly sensitive tools for disease detection with monoclonal antibody production it is possible to produce pure and highly specific antibodies against almost any type of antigen as a next-generation tool protein arrays in their role as miniaturized multiplexed immunoassays are perfectly suited for generating a maximum of diagnostically relevant information from very minute samples65 protein microarrays offer unparalleled throughput minimal reagent consumption and sensitive simultaneous detection of multiple targets58 currently there is rapid advancement of antibody microarrays that have been developed for clinical biothreat and point-of-care applications early applications included the development of a protein microarray with 35 antibodies which was used to subtype the 20 most common salmonella serovars66 and a similar microarray was developed for e coli
67 lipopolysaccharide carbohydrate-based and whole-cell microarrays have also been used for antibody-based detection of pathogens such as francisella tularensis68 69
liquid array technology has been adapted to the detection of avian influenza ai virus antibody in commercial poultry70 the assay uses recombinant ai virus nucleoprotein conjugated to microspheres to detect the influenza-specific antibody the ai virus liquid array has a 993 sensitivity and a 947 specificity this liquid array format can theoretically detect 100 different analytes in a single assay therefore this technology has the potential to simultaneously detect and subtype all influenza hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins as well as antibodies specific to the other relevant avian diseasesprotein microarrays with high pathogen proteome content offer a valuable platform for high-throughput serology these antigen microarrays have been used to identify seropositive individuals by using the presence of serum antibodies to detect exposure to a specific pathogen zhu and coworkers monitored the antibody profiles of patients with sars using protein microarrays containing 82 purified coronavirus proteins71 immunoreactivity against the coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins remained high for 120 to 320 days postinfection which provided a means to check for exposure long after infection has occurred the integration of dna and protein-based microarray methods may extend the range of rapid clinical diagnostic testingin protein expression analysis proteins or biomarkers from complex biological samples are identified and correlated with diagnostic patterns that are unique to specific cancer and disease conditions the main challenge in the development of biomarker diagnostics is the biological variability among patient samples as well as the large dynamic range of biomarker concentrations both disease and cancer biomarker discovery oncoproteomics has been studied extensively using proteomics biomarkers have been identified that correlate with bladder cancer breast cancer colorectal cancer esophageal cancer gastrointestinal stromal tumors glioma hepatocellular carcinoma leukemia lung cancer lymphoma nasopharyngeal carcinoma ovarian cancer pancreatic cancer prostate cancer and urothelial carcinoma72 protein microarrays designed with hundreds of copies of protein-coding oligonucleotides or bio-barcodes can serve to amplify the protein target and are capable of detecting proteins down to attomolar concentrations73
besides protein expression analysis protein microarrays can also be used to determine the functional analysis of proteins including protein interaction involving immobilized proteins or peptides low molecular weight compounds dna oligosaccharides tissues or cells protein microarrays have been developed for the detection of allergen-specific immunoglobulin e reactivity and detection of specific auto antibodies associated with autoimmune diseases in the field of autoimmune disease diagnostics multiplexed assays are currently entering the diagnostic market74 and in the future sets of tumor marker panels may also be applied to monitor treatment therapy for specific disease processes immunoassay panels have been developed for fertility cardiac disease tumors cytokines and growth factors cell adhesion molecules thyroid function and drug residues virtually every biological component from diverse small molecules macromolecules eg dna proteins and entire living cells have been placed on microarraysa biomarker is a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes pathogenic processes or pharmacologic responses to therapeutic intervention75 research regarding biomarkers associated with disease has greatly advanced in both the human and veterinary medical fields the challenge of this information is to determine which marker or combination of markers is optimal for the condition to which they are applied evidence from research studies suggests that using multiple markers may be superior to using single markers alone multiple marker combinations provide information of greater diagnostic and prognostic value than any single marker alonethe most promising use of veterinary biomarkers are those used to evaluate cardiovascular disease in dogs and cats76 77 78 currently circulating natriuretic peptides are regarded as the most promising markers used in the evaluation of such patients other markers include those of myocyte injury typified by troponins markers of myocyte stress adrenomedullin matrix metalloproteinases markers of endothelial function and markers of inflammation c-reactive protein79 concentrations of some of these substances are known to change in response to heart failure and the treatment of cardiac disease in veterinary patients76 77
clinical application of biomarkers in the future includes the detection of subclinical diseases diagnosis of acute or chronic syndromes risk determination therapy selection and monitoring of disease progression or response to treatment78 presently most biomarker testing takes place at dedicated laboratories thereby increasing the expense of the test and the time needed to perform the test the development of biosensor technology will enable biomarker testing to be accomplished in a smaller faster cheaper and portable formata biosensor can be generally defined as a device that consists of a biological recognition system and a transducer a biosensor is a compact analytical device that integrates a biological element on a solid-state surface enabling a reversible biospecific interaction with an analyte80 the interaction of the analyte with the bioreceptor produces an effect measured by the transducer a device used to convert the information into a measurable signal the biological component of a biosensor can include any molecule used for biomolecular recognition biosensors have been designed using specific binding proteins lectins nucleic acids membranes whole cells antibodies or antibody fragments biosensors that detect the immunological interaction between a specific antibody and antigen are referred to as immunoreaction-based biosensors or immunosensors80 some biosensors use aptamers single-stranded dna or rna oligonucleotide sequences that recognize various target molecules with high affinity and specificity these ligand-binding oligonucleotides mimic properties of antibodies in a variety of diagnostic formatsthere are 2 main types of biosensors biocatalytic and bioaffinity-based biosensors and they are primarily categorized on the detection principle applied biocatalytic sensors use enzymes to catalyze a signaling biochemical reaction and bioaffinity-based sensors monitor the binding event itself transducers convert the biological interaction to a detectable signal and can be based on electrochemical eg potentiometric amperometric conductometric optical microgravimetric or thermometric calorimetric principlesbiosensors have been designed using carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles for signal amplification combining the molecular specificity of biological recognition with an operationally simple transducer extend these small units diagnostic capability toward portability and ease of use recent developments in immunosensors have produced solid state systems that allow for rapid and continuous monitoring of antibody-antigen reactions in real timethe specificity of the biosensor system is determined by the immobilized detection molecule20 innovative strategies using biomarkers represent alternative strategies for reliable cancer testing and for detecting clinical markers predictive of cardiovascular and other diseases biosensors using antibodies or dnarna strands can detect infectious disease agents and be used for hormone and drug assays20 81
currently most biomarker testing takes place at a dedicated centralized laboratory but in the future this technology will provide a means of rapid convenient and economical testing at the point of patient care in cancer there is a strong connection between early detection and positive patient outcome thereby improving patient survival and disease prognosis in many cases in addition to changes within the host genome complex molecular alterations such as over or under expression of a protein can occur during the course of tumorigenesis82 biosensors can detect these changes and can analyze molecular biomarkers for tumor diagnosis and classification monitor response to treatment and detect recurrence of the disease cancer biosensors have been developed in a panel format for the simultaneous detection of different cancer biomarkers83 84
because most cancer biomarkers are not specific to a particular tumor the use of an array to detect multiple markers increases the diagnostic value of their definitive diagnosis85 recently biosensors have been developed to detect breast cancer ovarian cancer gastrointestinal tract carcinoma chronic myelogenous leukemia and prostate cancer20 prostate-specific antigen is the most reliable tumor marker to detect prostate cancer in its early stages the recently developed biosensors for prostate-specific antigen detection are sensitive to a limit of 4 pgml86
the importance of inflammatory markers in the early detection of cardiovascular disease has been demonstrated81 biosensors are being developed to detect c-reactive protein cardiac troponin myoglobin and natriuretic peptide in a sensitive and efficient manner based on a competitive immunoassay in a portable biosensor good correlation between salivary cortisol and levels of free cortisol in serum has been demonstrated87
a nucleic acid biosensor is an analytical device that integrates an oligonucleotide with a signal transducer88 the nucleic acid probe is immobilized on the transducer and acts as the biorecognition molecule to detect dnarna fragments several dna-based biosensors have recently been developed for the detection of virus-related sequences and other infectious agents19 dna or rna ligands can also be synthesized to be used to detect amino acids drugs proteins and other molecules dna or rna ligands can bind to their targets with affinity ranging from the micromolar to the nanomolar level and can discriminate between closely related targets20 there is a growing need for small fast efficient and portable biosensorsthe analysis of thousands of small molecules metabolites eg sugars organic acids amino acids nucleotides by means of a global approach is referred to as metabolomics combined with pattern recognition processes metabolomics defines a metabolic phenotype metabotype in the study species89 this approach combines high-throughput sample analysis with computer-assisted pattern recognition techniques whereby the full metabolite profile metabolome of a cell tissue or organism is determined metabolomics is a powerful investigative tool for studying the biochemical effects of disease and screening for potential pharmacologic agents alterations in the metabolic profile often present much earlier in the course of disease than induced histopathological changes metabolomics can be a sensitive early indicator of a disease process and because metabolites are conserved across species lines screening patterns can be applied to a wide range of species89
the application of metabolomics in veterinary medicine is in its infancy whitfield and colleagues used metabolomics to distinguish canine congenital portosystemic vascular anomalies from acquired hepatopathies90 other early applications include the analysis of cadmium toxicity in rodents91 assessment of sublethal stress in aquatic organisms92 and neurotransmitter deficits in cerebral tissue from a mouse model of human batten disease93
although current applications to the field of veterinary medicine are rare metabolomics use in early preclinical safety assessment make it a rapidly developing tool in the field of drug investigations metabolomics enables a noninvasive systems assessment of a broad spectrum of biologic responses by an individual to the effects induced by therapeutic compounds which could impact all stages of veterinary drug research and developmentmolecular theranostics is an emerging area in which molecular diagnostic tools are used to provide rapid less than 1 hour accurate and informative diagnostic microbiology assays conventional microbial culture and sensitivity testing methods require at least 2 days time because of the reliance on growth and isolation of microorganisms veterinarians must frequently treat patients empirically with broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents which may not be needed or may not be effective the common use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials is associated with an increasing rate of microorganism resistance which may complicate patient treatment early diagnosis and treatment of diseases reduce the risk of the patient developing long-term disease complications for some diseases a prompt treatment will also reduce further transmission of the disease to other animals or humansassays based on the detection of nucleic acids offer enormous potential for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of microbial infections this assay-based testing can be extended to include the detection and characterization of genes or mutations associated with antimicrobial resistance and virulence94
advances in genomics and proteomics will provide the essential nucleotide or amino-acid sequence data required to design accurate assays efficiency will also depend on the development of rapid simple and efficient methods for microbial nucleic acid or protein extraction from a variety of clinical samples finally rapid and specific assays and the ability to detect all or most targeted microorganisms in multiplex target amplification systems or signal amplification technologies are needed this will help future technologies reach a level of analytical sensitivity appropriate for testing directly from clinical samples without previous enrichment thereby leading to more judicious antimicrobial usage and a concurrent reduction in antimicrobial-resistant organisms94 to be useful diagnostic methods must be accurate simple and affordablesince december 2019 a cluster of acute respiratory illness now known as novel coronavirusinfected pneumonia ncip and has spread throughout china and now to 195 other countries and territories

 on 7 january 2020 a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 previously known as 2019ncov was identified in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in wuhan and was confirmed as the cause of the ncip
5
 studies have shown that the disease caused by sarscov2 recently named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 by world health organization who could induce symptoms including fever dry cough dyspnea fatigue and lymphopenia in infected patients in more severe cases infections causing viral pneumonia may lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and even death

 most of the initial cases of covid19 the disease caused by sarscov2 were all related to huanan seafood wholesale market which sells aquatic products live poultries and wild animals
2
 the first batch of cases identified later showed no exposure or even no relation to huanan wholesale market and the humantohuman transmission was confirmed moreover nosocomial infections were reported in some health care workers

 the number of fatalities due to covid19 is escalating however at this time there are no specific vaccines or treatments for covid19 most therapy consists of empirical antibiotics antiviral therapy oseltamivir and systemic corticosteroids which may have a limited effect on a fatal outcome evidence is now accumulating that the condition of some patients with covid19 deteriorates rapidly as of 20 may 2020 whos online covid19 situation dashboard reveals there have been 4 801 202 confirmed cases of covid19 including 318 935 deaths thus identifying the prognostic predictors of mortality in patients with covid19 might be useful for assessing the disease severity and making optimal treatment decisions the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio nlr has been suggested as a simple marker of the systemic inflammatory response in critical care patients
8
 
9
 it has also been reported as an independent prognostic factor for noninfectious diseases such as acute myocardial infarction stroke and several types of cancers
10
 
11
 
12
 in addition nlr has been shown to be an independent indicator of both shortterm and longterm mortality in critically ill patients
13
 therefore the nlr is a systemic inflammatory marker and a potential predictor of clinical risk and outcome in many diseases to our knowledge the utility of nlr to predict mortality in patients with covid19 has not been studied yet based on the previous studies we hypothesized that nlr might relate to the disease severity and mortality in patients with covid19 in the current study we sought to investigate whether nlr is a prognostic factor in patients with covid19all adult age 18 years old patients who were diagnosed with covid19 according to who interim guidance were screened and those who died or were discharged between 11 january 2020 and 3 march 2020 were included in our study data were collected from patients who were cured and discharged or who died without a cure confirmation of covid19 enrolled in this study was diagnosed according to the guidance for corona virus disease 2019 6th edition released by the national health commission of china

all patients age more than 18 years and having neutrophil and lymphocyte counts results within 24 hours after admission were included in this study patients who missed the neutrophil and lymphocyte records or with chronic hematological disorder were excludedthe electronic medical records of the patients were reviewed by a trained research team of physicians in wuhan third hospital  tongren hospital of wuhan university epidemiological clinical laboratory treatment and outcome data were analyzed patient data included demographics medical history exposure history comorbidities symptoms signs laboratory findings and treatment antiviral antibiotic and corticosteroid therapies and respiratory support all data were checked by two physicians hc and js and a third researcher sn adjudicated any difference in interpretation between the two primary reviewersbaseline characteristics were presented as median with interquartile range iqr for continuous variables and as number with percentage for categorical variables comparisons between continuous variables were analyzed by the student t and mannwhitney u test based on variable distribution and categorical variables were analyzed by the 
2 test the data were tested to the kolmogorovsmirnov normality test for homogeneity of variance to assess the relationship between the nlr and inhospital mortality we did the receiver operating characteristics roc curve and reported area under the roc curve next we grouped the patients based on the cutoff value of nlr during hospitalization in addition to adjust potential confounding with variables we did a multivariate regression analysis the following variables were considered for multivariable adjustment age gender smoking status laboratory data comorbidities and intensive care unit icu length of stay the results were reported as hazard ratio and 95 confidence interval 95 ci all statistical processes were performed with the statistical package for the social sciences 200 spss inc chicago il a twosided p value less than 05 was considered statistically significantfrom 11 january 2020 to 3 march 2020 a total of 1004 patients diagnosed with covid19 were admitted to wuhan third hospital  tongren hospital of wuhan university of these 40 of these patients had died of covid19 the median age of nonsurvivors was 68 iqr 5879 years which was significantly older than survivors 62 5070 years male sex was more predominant in nonsurvivors 27 675 than in survivors 466 483 in the laboratory examination the levels of white blood cell wbc count neutrophil count serum creatine kinase creatine kinase isozyme lactate dehydrogenase blood urea nitrogen serum creatinine hydroxybutyratedehydrogenase ctni ddimer ntprobnp alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase bilirubin and hscrp were higher in nonsurvivors but levels of platelets lymphocyte albumin total cholesterol highdensity lipoprotein lowdensity lipoprotein levels were lower all p  05 in addition the number of comorbid diseases diseases diagnosed at admission or related to previous medical history in nonsurvivors was significantly higher than that in survivors especially renal insufficiency respiratory failure and cerebrovascular disease one important finding is that the median nlr value was 4906 range 25716970 in nonsurvivors and 411 range 244812 in survivors with a large difference between the two groups p  001 the baseline characteristics medical history and major laboratory findings of the two groups were shown in table 1nonparametric roc analysis showed that the cutoff value of the roc curve as the optimal threshold for inhospital mortality was 1175 that is when nlr was more than 1175 the model had the strongest predictive ability with an area under the curve of 0945 and 95 ci of 0917 to 0973 figure 1 sensitivity of 975 specificity of 781 and yoden index of 0756 we further divided patients into two groups using nlr greater than or less than or equal to 1175 as the criterion to compare the clinical characteristics of patients with a high nlr and those with a low nlr table 2after multivariate logistic regression analysis highnlr remained independently associated with inhospital death in addition we found that higher levels of hscrp ntprobnp and blood urea nitrogen as well as history of hypertension respiratory failure digestive system diseases and cerebrovascular diseases were also independently associated with inhospital mortality table 3in this study we found there was an association between nlr and the clinical outcomes in patients with covid19 following sarscov2 infection most of the patients presented lymphopenia and elevated levels of infectionrelated biomarkers more interestingly a higher number of neutrophils and a lower number of lymphocytes that is the increase of nlr were found in nonsurvivors with covid19 compared to survivors nlr has been shown to be a simple standalone method for evaluating systemic inflammation neutrophils play a central role in the innate immune response resulting in multiple organ failure and lethality of severely injured patients in contrast lymphocytes play a major role in the inflammatory response therefore a high nlr indicates an imbalance of the inflammatory response and may be a surrogate marker of disease severity in infectious diseases such as sepsis and bacteremia
16
 based on the roc curve analysis the nlr showed the significant performance to predict inhospital mortality the cutoff level for the nlr was 1175 figure 1 our study supports that a high nlr is a strong predictor for inhospital mortality in patients with covid19 nlr is a convenient marker of systemic inflammation and infection outperforms the predictive ability of absolute leukocyte lymphocyte or neutrophil counts and has been demonstrated to be a useful biomarker for predicting bacterial infection included pneumonia
9
 
13
 
17
 furthermore nlr is shown to predict outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease
18
 as well as solid tumor malignancy
19
 in addition higher nlr has been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in patients with acute pancreatitis and was identified as a significant predictor of icu admission and a longer length of stay
20
 increasing clinical data suggest that the nlr might be a powerful predictive and prognostic indicator for severe covid19
6
 
21
 
22
 consistent with previous findings that several patients infected with sarscov2 had a high neutrophil count and a low lymphocyte count during the severe phase
6
 the increased mortality rate in patients with nlr found in our study indicated a serious disturbance in the internal environment and potential critical condition in severe infected cases
23
 in general increased nlr was common among patients with covid19 which become more pronounced in severe cases on the basis of these we suggested that covid19 might damage lymphocytes and the immune system was impaired during the course of the disease consistent with the findings from chen et al
24
 we observed that the overall fatality rate for confirmed covid19 cases was higher in male than in female patients with the risk of death rising with age for both sexes furthermore we observed that 925 of patients had at least one underlying disorder ie renal insufficiency respiratory failure and cerebrovascular disease and a higher percentage of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in nonsurvivors than survivors in consistent with those reports
2
 
6
 these findings suggested that covid19 is more likely to infected those elder men with chronic comorbidities due to weaker immune functions older patients often present with atypical signs and symptoms and have multiple comorbid conditions which often leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment and even death indeed these patients are at higher risk of covid19 hospital admission icu admission and inhospital death than are young adults
16
 
25
 physicians may find it timeconsuming and difficult to completely assess older patients however nlr is a biomarker that integrates two wbc subtypes representing two inversely and related immune pathways it represents an easily accessible objective parameter can be readily calculated from differential wbc counts more stable for measurement than the individual wbc counts and less affected by conditions that could change the individual cell counts
26
 the nlr is beneficial for clinicians to inform their understanding of the severity of covid19 a high calculated nlr may therefore aid in determining outcome risk need for close clinical monitoring and urgent effective treatment samaras et al
27
 proposed a targeted approach for highrisk patients
25
 our results may also help in the early identification of older patients at higher risk of covid19our results show a significant increase in mortality with increasing quartile of baseline nlr in patients with covid19 the main reason for this difference may be due to an insufficient number of patients with low nlr in our study another reason is that part of patients in our study included had a diagnosis of sepsis in patients with covid19 which may suggest a more severe inflammation in patients in our studysystemic inflammation is associated with the development and progression of covid19 recent studies have shown increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers were associated with poor outcomes in covid19
21
 nlr may serve as an additional inflammatory biomarker mainly because it reflects the systemic inflammatory and stress responses with neutrophils rising and lymphocytes apoptosis
28
 
29
 a study of patients with trauma and systemic inflammatory response syndrome showed lymphopenia was associated with high mortality the lymphocytes were important in the regulation of an appropriate inflammatory response and low circulating lymphocytes may perpetuate a harmful inflammatory status
30
 high nlr in patients is associated with high levels of inflammation de jager et al
31
 showed that nlr predicts bacteremia was better than conventional inflammation markers like creactive protein wbc count and neutrophil count a recent study showed that nlr as well as other inflammatory factors like lymphopenia and plasma calprotectin are independent predictors of increased allcause mortality in moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in stable phase and not in treatment with systemic glucocorticoids
32
 thus we supposed increased nlr values could predict the poor outcome in covid19 patients on the evidence of the association between nlrrelated inflammation and disease severitythis study has some important limitations to consider first it was a singlecenter and retrospective observational study subject selection bias could not be avoided and the causal relationship between nlr and mortality could not be drawn therefore our findings need to be confirmed in a prospective multicenter study second our primary outcome was allcause inhospital mortality so we could not analyze the cause of specific mortalities the exact mechanisms underlying the association between nlr and mortalities in elderly individuals are not certain third nlr value is influenced by comorbidities and medications that affect the neutrophil and lymphocyte count forth systemic inflammation may cause mortality but further studies are needed to identify the exact mechanisms we only analyzed nlr at admission however there may be a specific pattern in serial nlr examination if there is an association between serial nlr and mortality then this association could have more specificity in predicting mortality as previously discussed our study only shows an association so there is a limitation of the clinical implications thus more studies are needed to identify the associations between nlr and causespecific mortality in elderly individualsin summary we found high nlr was associated with poor outcome in critically ill patients with covid19 nlr was an independent risk factor for predicting allcause inhospital mortality in covid19 patients thus the nlr at admission may represent a surrogate marker of disease severity however we need more external validation to use the nlr in the clinical decisionmaking processthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsxy and fl conceived the project data collection and analyses were performed by fl fz sf yd hw rc zy yl js lz jz cg hc wg xh and yz the manuscript was written by xy and wz and revised by dl and sn all authors read and approved the final manuscriptthe first case of novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was detected in wuhan china in late december that broke out worldwide affecting over 227 countries and caused approximately three lakhs deaths till date httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus accessed on 13052020 the mortality rate remained 1450 worldwide httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus accessed on 13052020 world health organisation had declared covid-19 as pandemic disease httpwwweurowhointenhealth-topicshealth-emergenciescoronavirus-covid-19newsnews20203who-announces-covid-19-outbreak-a-pandemic as of today 13052020 the united states of america contributed the highest number of infected cases and death due to covid-19 in comparison to other populations httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus accessed on 13052020 covid-19 infection displays a wide range of clinical manifestations a recent study 1 highlighted cough sputum production diarrhoea nauseavomiting and shortness of breath as more frequent clinical phenotypes in criticalnon-survived covid-19 patients and in contrast fever and headache were less prevalent furthermore the pathogenesis of the diseases is regulated by several host factors various biomolecules such as aspartate aminotransferase creatinine high-sensitive cardiac troponin procalcitonin lactate dehydrogenase and d-dimer has been increased in covid-19 critical patients in comparison to those with non-severe infected cases1table 1
the upregulation of c reactive protein crp has been reported during severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak in 2002 and associated with respiratory dysfunctions and death of the patients 2 based on these observations various studies were carried out in covid-19 patients hypothesizing crp as one of the possible biomolecules linked with the death of the infected patients however the observations of the reports remained contradictorytwo authors rkp and brp searched various databases medline sciencedirect and scopus to trace eligible studies for the present meta-analysis the keywords used for the search were covid-19 coronavirus 2019 2019-ncov sars-cov-2 crp c-reactive protein survivors non-survivors death till 10th may 2020 the title and abstracts of the articles obtained were screened and apposite papers were downloaded furthermore various preprint servers biorxiv medrxiv and ssrn were also screened with the above-mentioned keywordsvarious inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered in the present investigation inclusion of a report in the current meta-analysis must have a added analysis for death and survivors b plasmaserum crp concentrations c data must be presented in mean standard deviation sd or median interquartile range exclusion of the articles was based on the following conditions a duplicate articles b research articles including only survivors or death cases c lack of crp concentrations data d review article summaries or case reporttwo authors brs and ap extracted data such as authors details years of publication population number of covid-19 infected subjects death and survivors crp concentrations in mean sd or median interquartile range significance value details are shown in table-1the meta-analysis was performed by comprehensive meta-analysis v31 software biostat beggs funnel plot and eggers linear regression analysis were employed to test publication bias crp data was available in the median interquartile range format in most of the included reports and those were converted into mean  standard deviation according to an earlier report 3 association of crp concentrations with covid-19 disease prognosis was analyzed and the combined standard difference in means and p-values were calculated the q test and i2 statistics evaluated heterogeneity among included reports based on the results of heterogeneity statistics random heterogeneous or fixed model non-heterogenous were deployed for analysis furthermore a sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness of the meta-analysisa total of 122 and 153 articles were obtained after searching pubmed and scopus respectively after screening the titles abstracts and full text based on inclusion and exclusion criterias 14 articles including data of 15 different cohorts were enrolled for the present analysis further we found two articles related to our searched norms from preprint servers baseline data from all eligible publications were extracted and presented in table-1 crp data in median interquartile range were converted into the required format of cma v31 software mean  sd and sample number3both eggers regression analysis intercept 004 95 confidence interval -548 to 558 and p 098 and beggs funnel plot supplementary fig-1 revealed absence of publication bias in the studied reports further significance heterogeneity across enrolled studies was observed q25203 pheterogeneity 0000 i29365 suggesting a random model as an appropriate model for testing of association between crp concentrations and mortality from covid-19 infectionthe result of the meta-analysis is shown in fig1

editingthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperbiomarkers are continuously being sought in the field of diagnostic microbiology for the laboratory diagnosis and assessment of microbial infections these have evolved from a simple clinical index 1 2 using nonspecific screening tests such as the white blood cell with leukocyte differential the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the c-reactive protein to the use of pro-inflammatory cytokineschemokines 3 4 to most recent use of microrna mirna molecules 57 the last of which have the greatest potential for predicting infection a set of clinical and laboratory criteria necessary for an ideal diagnostic marker of infection have previously been proposed by ng and his colleagues 8 according these criteria an ideal biomarker should possess at a minimum the following characteristics a biochemically a biomarker should be stable and remain significantly deregulated in the body fluid compartment for at least 1224 h even after commencement of appropriate treatment that may allow an adequate time window for specimen collection or storage without significant decomposition of the active compound until laboratory processing b its concentration should be determined quantitatively and the method of measurement should be automatic rapid easy and inexpensive c the collection of a specimen should be minimally invasive and require a small volume eg 05 ml blood numerous biomarkers have been found and tested in clinical practice 14 currently microrna mirna molecules are without a doubt the biomarkers with the greatest potential capacities in the diagnostic microbiology fieldthe first mirna lin-4 was inadvertently discovered in caenorhabditis elegans in 1993 by lee and colleagues 9 however recognition of the mirna let-7 and its ability to regulate lin-14 by ruvkun and colleagues 10 in 2000 resulted in the establishment of this new class of regulatory nucleic acids and their potential value in diagnostic microbiologythe majority of the characterized mirna is intergenic and is located in introns 11 primary mirna transcripts ie pri-mirnas are transcribed by rna polymerase ii or polymerase iii in the nucleus ribonuclease drosha cleaves pri-mirnas and releases 6080 nt stem-loop intermediate structures named pre-mirnas the pre-mirnas are transported to cytoplasm by exportin-5 protein and then are cleaved by dicer rnase iii to form a mature double-stranded mirna one strand of the mirna duplex is subsequently unwound and then incorporated into an effector protein complex termed rna-induced silencing complex risc which is responsible for the gene silencing in a posttranscriptional manner 1214 mature mirnas are single-stranded rna molecules of about 1925 nucleotides in length through partial homology to the 3-untranscribed region utr in target mrnas mirnas control of gene expression via repression of translation as well as reducing mrna levels directlya large number of mirnas have been found in various animal and plant tissues 15 according to mirbase 210 httpmicrornasangerorg which is a collective registry of currently known mirna sequences and targets hosted by the sanger institute there are currently 2588 recognized mirna sequences in the homo sapiens genome this number is constantly growing as new mirna sequences are discovered importantly mirnas have been detected in human body fluids including peripheral blood plasma these circulating mirnas are found as extracellular nuclease-resistant entities that are strikingly stable in blood plasma 16 such mirnas have been found circulating not only in serum and plasma but also in other body fluids such as saliva tears and urine 17 some of these mirnas appear to be enriched in specific fluids 17 18 these circulating mirnas subsequently have become the focus of ongoing research the properties origin function and relationship with disease of circulating mirnas have been intensively investigated 1619 a number of important observations have been noted circulating mirnas are present in a stable form that is protected from endogenous rnase activity 16 19 20 most extracellular circulating mirnas in plasma completely pass through 022 micron filters but remain in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation at 110000 g which indicates the non-vesicular origin of these mirnas 16 finally circulating mirnas have been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with the 96 kda ago2 protein this ago2 protein is part of an rna-induced silencing complex 16 and might account for the high stability of this comlex 16 some groups also reported a higher stability of mirnas compared to mrna in samples obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues 2123 the expression level of mirnas has been noted as consistent among individuals of the same species 19 expression alteration of circulating mirnas has been reported to be associated with pathophysiological states including various cancers heart disease pregnancy and diabetes 24 25 needless to say serum plasma and other body fluid specimens are generally available for clinical testing profiling hundreds of mirna requires only 200 ul of sera 20 thus these unique and stable characteristics of circulating mirnas potentially make them extremely useful biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis the potential use of tissue andor circulating mirnas for diagnosing cancer was quickly recognized 12 13 1820 22 the discovery of virus-encoded mirnas and the recognition that such mirnas played multiple roles in virus infections has resulted in their use in diagnosing viral infections 5 2628virus-encoded mirnas were recognized as having many functions in viral infections including controls for viral replication and thus potentially limiting antiviral responses inhibition of apoptosis and stimulation of cellular growth 26 moreover unique host cell mirnas expression profiles have been revealed in response to various microbial infections 27 28 host mirna thus appears to play an important role in viral replication and may be used by host cells to control viral infection the first virus-encoded mirna was described by pfeffer and his colleagues in 2004 when they identified five ebv-encoded pre-mirnas 29 since then hundreds of virus-encoded mirnas have been described in humans animals and plants examples of human virus-encoded mirna are shown in table 1 bewilderingly more than 95 of the virus-encoded mirnas known today are of herpesvirus origin 30 herpesvirus mirnas were initially determined to not be required for lytic replication but were thought to strongly enhance viral pathogenesis including oncogenesis and also to promote latently infected cells 30 subsequently the role of herpesvirus mirnas in virus latency and persistence has been confirmed with specific cellular mirnas being identified as inhibiting reactivation of herpesviruses thereby promoting latent infections 31 32 interestingly almost all virus-encoded mirnas are encoded by dna viruses except those encoded by retroviruses which reverse-transcribe and integrate their genetic material into host dna aberrantly expressed circulating mirnas have been explored for the diagnosis and prognosis of several infectious diseases including sepsis 33 34 hbv 35 and hcv 36the interactions between viral and cellular mirnas in viral diseases and virus-associated cancers are complex 37 viral mirnas target perfectly complementary viral mrnas as well as imperfectly complementary viral andor cellular mrnas viral mirnas modulate expression of host gene involved in cell proliferation and survival stress responses and antiviral defense pathways which are pivotal for viral replication 2628 3739 another primary function of virus mirnas is to regulate the latent-lytic switch during latency the host cell maintains the viral genome and only a limited portion of virus genome is expressed viral gene expression is restricted but virus mirnas and their precursors are regularly detected 38 there is an accumulating amount of evidence that has demonstrated that virus-encoded mirnas mediate evolutionarily conserved functions eg immune evasion cell cycle control promotion of latency etc 5 2628 3739 the mirnas themselves show poorly primary sequence conservation 39 these phenomena raise an important question can viral mirnas be used as the detection maker for virus infection during the latent infection phase despite the fact that little or no viral protein is being produced further studies are needed to evaluate this hypothesisthe roles of micrornas in hiv-1 replication and latency are being intensely investigated in order to provide new approaches to clear the viral reservoir 46 47 it has become apparent that cellular mirnas may play crucial roles in controlling hiv-1 infection and replication 47 houzet and colleagues have profiled mirnas in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs from hiv-1-infected patients 48 they found the t cell-abundant mirnas mir-223 mir-150 mir-146 mir-16 and mir-191 were downregulated three- to ninefold compared to cells from uninfected controls depending on the disease stage of the patient 48 triloubet et al reported increased expression of 11 mirnas including mir-122 mir-370 mir-373 and mir-297 in hiv-1-infected jurkat cells whereas expression of the polycistronic mirna cluster mir-17mir-92 comprises mir-17-5p3p mir-18 mir-19a mir-20a mir-19b-1 and mir-92-1 was strongly decreased 49 two cellular mirnas mir-196b and mir-1290 have been found to contribute to hiv-1 latency 50 like hiv-1 human t cell leukemia virus type 1 htlv-1 also infects cd4 t cells as seen with hiv-1 mirnas also play an important role in the pathogenesis of htlv-1 infection and transformation 51 52 two mirna profiling studies have been performed in infected cell lines and atl adult t cell leukemia cells 53 54 the studies find two common mirnas that are consistently downregulated in the context of htlv-1 infection for both hiv-1 and htlv-1 it is clear the mirnas play a role in latency inhibitors of these mirna could be used to activate latent retroviruses in order to assist in clearing the reservoirs of virusthe emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 following the earlier severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 20022003 marked two instances in which a highly pathogenic coronavirus was introduced into the human population in the twenty-first century 55 along with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses 56 these respiratory viruses are notable due to their potential to cause pandemics 57 the potential role of mirnas to diagnose these respiratory tract infections is under investigation for example the mirna expression profile in bronchoalveolar stem cells bascs infected with sars coronavirus cov has been determined using mirna microarray 58 a total of 116 mirnas were found differentially expressed upregulated basc mirnas-17 mirnas-574-5p and mirnas-214 are co-opted by sars-cov to suppress its own replication and evade immune elimination until successful transmission takes place in contrast viral nucleocapsid and spike protein targets seem to co-opt downregulated mir-223 and mir-98 respectively 58 the mirna expression of avian influenza strains has also been investigated differentially expressed mirnas in chicken lung and trachea infected with a low pathogenic strain of h5n3 avian influenza virus were analyzed by a deep sequencing approach 59 a total of 73 and 36 mirnas are differentially expressed in lungs and trachea upon virus infection respectively 59 lung cellular micrornaome of mice infected by reconstructed 1918 influenza virus was compared with that of mice infected by a nonlethal seasonal influenza virus atexas3691 60 a group of micrornas including mir-200a and mir-223 were differentially expressed in response to influenza virus infection and infection by these two influenza viruses induced distinct microrna expression profiles 60 finally a novel avian-origin influenza a h7n9 caused 137 human infection cases with a 328 mortality rate characterization of the mirna profile in response to infection by this strain revealed significant alterations in serum mirna expression following virus infection in comparison with controls 61 this study confirmed the potential for using serum mirna expression for the diagnosis of viral respiratory diseaseshuman adenoviruses are dna viruses that cause infections in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients 62 adenovirus infections are associated with viral persistence and reactivation and continue to provide clinical challenges in terms of diagnosis and treatment adenoviruses express large amounts of noncoding virus-associated rnas able to saturate key factors of the rna interference processing pathway including exportin 5 and dicer 63 moreover a proportion of the noncoding virus-associated rna is cleaved by dicer in viral mirnas this cleaved rna results in mirnas that can saturate argonaute which is an essential protein for mirna function that engages in transcriptional silencing processes in the nucleus 63 64 therefore processing and function of cellular mirnas are blocked in cells infected by adenovirus 63 of note is that the cellular silencing machinery is active early after infection and can be used to control the adenovirus cell cycle 63 it is also important to realize that mirna expression has been found to fluctuate during the course of an adenovirus type 2 infection in human lung fibroblasts 65 the mirna expression profiles from adenovirus type 3 ad3-infected human laryngeal epithelial hep2 cells have been analyzed using a solid deep sequencing 66 a total of 44 mirnas demonstrated high expression and 36 mirnas showed lower expression in the ad3-infected cells than in control cells 66 the role of mirnas in adenovirus-infected cells is relevant because of the past and future use of recombinant adenoviruses as vectors for gene therapy 67 manipulation of the viral genome allows the use of these vectors to express therapeutic mirnas or to be silenced by the rnai machinery leading to safer vectors with specific tropisms adenovirus is known to interact with a number of different extracellular intracellular and membrane-bound innate immune sensing systems 68 such as toll-like receptor 4 68 69 the investigation of mirnas expression during adenovirus infection is likely to provide important new insights into the scope and mechanisms of these cellular defensive responses 70among the human herpesviruses cytomegalovirus cmv is an important human pathogen that has the potential to disseminate via the bloodstream to all organs but only produces overt clinical disease if the viral load achieves high levels 71 normally there is a strong immune response such that the infected individual typically remains asymptomatic 71 over time this immune response wains and infected individuals can become symptomatic due to a higher viral load for this reason mirna expression in latent and symptomatic infections is being studied 72 wang et al monitored the time course of cellular mirna expression in human cytomegalovirus cmv-infected cells using mirna microarrays and found that 49 mirnas significantly changed on at least 1 time point 73 there were no global unidirectional changes with changes for these mirnas sometimes being transient fu and colleagues noted similar results in a human cytomegalovirus latent infection cell model using thp-1 cells 74 the mir-199amir-214 cluster mir-199a-5p mir-199a-3p and mir-214 was recently found to be downregulated in cmv-infected cells 75 human cytomegalovirus mirna mir-us25-1-5p has been shown to inhibit viral replication by targeting multiple cellular genes during infection 75 clearly additional studies are needed but the use of mirnas will undoubtedly increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of cytomegalovirusherpes simplex viruses hsv are evolutionarily ancient viruses that are ubiquitous having a worldwide prevalence 76 there are two serotypes hsv-1 and hsv-2 both of which primarily infect humans through epithelial cells hsv infections are extremely common seropositivity occurs in 5090 of adult populations 76 the success of hsv-1 and hsv-2 as human pathogens is due to the virus first infecting epithelial cells and then entering sensory neurons via nerve termini 76 77 latency within long-lived neuronal cell bodies and subsequent mucocutaneous shedding is central to the survival of this neurotrophic virus 77 the generally mild sequelae of hsv infection reflects a balance between the host and the virus in most immunocompetent persons 76 77 however hsv infections of the central nervous system are recognized but relatively rare complications of this infection 78 the mirnas of hsv are of particular interest due to the latency of this virus as well as its role in cns infections 79 infection of human primary neural cells with a high phenotypic reactivator hsv-1 17syn can induce upregulation of a brain-enriched microrna mirna-146a 80 both mir-101 and mir-132 are also found to be highly upregulated after hsv-1 81 82another factor in terms of the involvement of hsv in cns infections is the fact that mirnas are key regulators of neuroinflammation 83 several mirnas have been found to play an important role in the microglia-mediated inflammatory response including mir-155 and mir-146a 83 another mirna mir-125 plays a critical role in the adaptation of microglia and macrophages to the cns microenvironment 84 traumatic brain injury has been shown to produce profound and lasting neuroinflammation micrornas have been implicated in the regulation of inflammation after traumatic brain injury 85 in particular mir-155 is induced after traumatic brain injury and is thought to play an important role in the regulation of the ifn response and neurodegeneration following brain injuries 85 the net sum of this regulation is thought to be neuroprotective which in turn may predispose the brain to viral infections such as herpes simplex encephalitis 86kaposis sarcoma ks-associated herpesvirus kshv is the etiological agent of ks this virus is also known as human herpesvirus 8 hhv-8 87 kaposis sarcoma is a mesenchymal tumor with poorly understood molecular and cytogenetic changes the predicted target genes for differentially expressed mirnas include genes that are involved in cellular processes such as angiogenesis and apoptosis which suggests a role for these mirnas in the pathogenesis of kaposis sarcoma 88 ks tumor cells are latently infected with kshv which express only a subset of viral genes among them 12 mirnas 89 the metabolic properties of kshv-infected cells are similar to those of cancer cell and display features of lymphatic endothelial differentiation 89 the m type k15 protein of kshv induces the expression of micrornas mir-21 and mir-31 via this conserved motif 90 while k13 strongly stimulated upregulation of mir-146a 91 kshv mirnas expression decrease mitochondrial biogenesis and induce aerobic glycolysis this metabolic shift favors latency and offers a growth advantage 89epstein-barr virus ebv is a gammaherpesvirus that infects most humans during their lifetime 92 93 these infections are usually asymptomatic but result in a lifelong latent infection 94 that is controlled by the hosts immune system 95 ebv also is an oncogenic herpesvirus 96 that is endemic in humans and is found in about 15 of patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma dlbcl 97 multiple cellular functions are mediated by the mirnas of ebv 98 for example ebv de novo infection of primary cultured human b-cells results in a dramatic downregulation of cellular mirna expression with 995 of the mirnas detected being downregulated with an average downregulation of 1992-fold 99 imig et al found that expression of hsa-mir-424 hsa-mir-223 hsa-mir-199a-3p hsa-mir-199a-5p hsa-mir-27b hsa-mir-378 hsa-mir-26b hsa-mir-23a and hsa-mir-23b were upregulated and those of hsa-mir-155 hsa-mir-20b hsa-mir-221 hsa-mir-151-3p hsa-mir-222 hsa-mir-29bc and hsa-mir-106a were downregulated more than twofold due to ebv-infection of dlbcl 100 cameron et al demonstrated differential expression of cellular mirnas in type iii versus type i ebv latency including elevated expression of mir-21 mir-23a mir-24 mir-27a mir-34a mir-146a and b and mir-155 in contrast mir-28 expression was found to be lower in type iii latency 101the role of mirnas in mammalian host signaling and defense against bacterial pathogens has been recognized 102 and will provide both insights and diagnostic opportunities the use of mirna patterns for diagnosing bacterial infections is evolving 6 helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that utilizes multiple colonization factors and virulence factors to persist in the human stomach for life 103 this persistent colonization of the gastric mucosa results in an inflammatory process that may remain asymptomatic for decades or progress to a more serious disease such as gastric carcinoma 104 the host immune response along with the h pylori gene expression and mirnas is involved in this process specific mirna patterns may prove to be useful for detecting a shift from asymptomatic carriage to gastric carcinoma 104 in vitro infection assays have revealed that h pylori infection can affect mirna expression profiles specifically mirnas such as mirna-155 mirna-16 and mirna-146a are significantly upregulated in human gastric epithelial cells during infection 105 more recently expression patterns of mirna in gastric mucosa infected with h pylori using endoscopic biopsy specimens were determined by microarray there were 31 differentially expressed mirnas between the h pylori-infected and h pylori-uninfected mucosa more than twofold and mirna expression profiling could distinguish h pylori status with the eight mirnas yielding acceptable sensitivity and specificity 106 overexpression of mir-223 has been described in h pylori-associated gastric cancer and appears to contribute to cancer cell proliferation and migration 107 muscle-specific mirnas mir-1 and mir-133 were significantly downregulated in the stomachs after long-term infection with h pylori in mouse model 108salmonellae cause a wide range of human infections including gastroenteritis bacteremia enteric fever and focal infections such as osteomyelitis 109 salmonellae have been shown to render human host cells more susceptible to infection by controlling host cell cycle progression through the active modulation of host cell mirnas 110 schulte et al identified differentially regulated mirnas by comparative deep sequencing of a total of 14 cdna libraries prepared from the small rna population of host cells before or after salmonella infection or in mock-treated cells 111 in murine raw 2647 cells upregulation of mir-21 mir-146ab and mir-155 was observed after infection they also observed significant downregulation of several let-7 family members namely let-7alet-7clet-7dlet-7flet-7 glet-7i and mir-98 in hela cells a significant upregulation of mirnas by salmonella was limited to mir-1308 in contrast mir-21 mir-146ab or mir-155 remained unaffected intriguingly downregulation of let-7 mirnas also occurred in hela cells 111mycobacterium avium subspecies hominissuis is an opportunistic pathogen of immunocompromised individuals 112 sharbati et al performed mirna as well as mrna expression analysis of human monocyte-derived macrophages infected with several mycobacterium avium hominissuis strains using microarrays as well as rt-qpcr 113 they that found expressions of let-7e mir-29a and mir-886-5p were increased in response to mycobacterial infection at 48 h 113the human papillomavirus hpv is associated with a number of oral genital and cutaneous conditions that may be benign or malignant 114 115 the association of hpv and cervical cancer is well-known because most cervical cancers contain hpv dna notably hpv types 16 and 18 116 the contribution of hpv to anogenital oral and oropharyngeal cancers is less clear 115 the altered expression of mirnas in these hpv-associated cancers has been investigated as a marker for possible diagnosis and therapy 117 expressions of mir-23b mir-34a and mir-218 are significantly reduced by hpv e6 infection while hpv e7 infection downregulates expression of mir-15amir-16-1 and mir-203 118northern blotting was the first technique used to detect mirnas and is considered the gold standard for characterizing mirna expression the basic procedures of mirna northern blotting are similar to traditional blotting and are done as follows a the small rna molecules are separated by using high-percentage denaturing urea-acrylamide gels rather than the usual agarose electrophoresis gels b the small rna molecules are transferred from the gel onto a membrane c the mirna molecules are fixed on the membrane through various cross-linking procedures and d the membrane is hybridized with radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes northern blotting methods are able to determine the absolute amount of mirna in a sample by blotting a dilution series of synthetic oligo mirna molecules of known concentrations in parallel with the sample the concentration of mirna in the sample can be calculated by a standard curve obtained from the dilution series however short length as well as low prevalence of mature mirna molecules can lead to poor sensitivity of such routine northern analysis it requires a large amount of total rna for each sample generally more than 5 g other disadvantages of this method include low throughput and potential environment hazards of radiolabeling several technical modifications have been used to improve detection sensitivity lna locked nucleic acid-modified oligonucleotide probes increase the affinity between lna probes and target mirna which results to at least tenfold increase of sensitivity 121 using soluble carbodiimide cross-link method increases the efficiency of mirna that are fixed on the membrane which can increase by 2550-fold mirna detection sensitivity compared to the traditional uv cross-linking method 122the most widely used method for detection and qualification of mirna appears to be real-time quantitative rt-pcr rt-qpcr the small size of the mature mirna sequences as well as sequence homology between the mature and precursor mirna forms limits the direct application of conventional rt-pcr protocols to mirna detection to solve these problems innovative solutions have been applied for each step of rt-qpcr used for the quantitative analysis of mirnas the first step in rt-qpcr of mirnas is the accurate and complete conversion of mirna into cdna two different approaches for reverse transcription of mirnas have been reported in the first approach mirnas are reverse transcribed individually by using mirnas-specific reverse transcription primers both stem-loop applied biosystems co fig 1a and a linear primer exiqon fig 1b containing partial complementary sequence of 3-end of mirna can be annealed to mirna in order to prime the reverse transcription the double-stranded structure of the stem-loop primer prevents its nonspecific binding to pre- and pri-mirnas thereby increasing the specificity of the assay unlike stem-loop primer the design of the linear primer is simpler but the linear primer cannot discriminate mature mirna from their precursorsanother approach is done as follows mirnas are first tailed with adenosine nucleotides at 3-end of mirna with polya polymerase fig 1c or linker adaptor with t4 rna ligase 1 fig 1d then a primer consisting of an oligodt sequence with a universal primer-binding sequence at its 5-end or a universal primer complementary to the 3-end of the linker is used to prime reverse transcription 119 the universal reverse primer sequence is introduced into the cdna during reverse transcription the design of the mirna-specific forward primer is critical for the specificity and sensitivity of the rt-qpcr assay lna modification is a widely used method for increasing the tm and the specificity of primer each incorporated lna monomer increases the tm up to 28 c depending upon the position of the lna moiety in the oligonucleotide primer 123there are two approaches available for detection of rt-qpcr products one approach uses sybr green dye whose fluorescence increases approximately 100 times upon intercalating into dsdna chain this property is used to monitor real-time amplification products as they accumulate during the pcr reaction one limitation of the sybr green-based method is that target pcr products and nonspecific products cannot be discriminated therefore a melting point analysis is usually required following the pcr amplification which can be reached by using a dual-labeled hydrolysis taqman probe the basis for this type of taqman probe detection has been reviewed by benes 119 the characteristics of taqman mirna assays make them ideally suited for detection of mature mirnas moreover these taqman mirna assays can discriminate related mirnas that differ only one nucleotide however the cost of the taqman probes is higher than the sybr green method which limits its routine use in most laboratoriesthe rt-qpcr method has demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity with ability to accurately detect mirnas in a single stem cell 124 125 only low amounts of starting material in the range of nanograms of total rna are needed and quantitative results can be acquired within 3 h this method also has a considerably larger dynamic range compared to microarray analysis recently the rt-qpcr technique has been adapted for increased throughput by developing a mirna pcr array that can detect hundreds of mirnas at one reaction tube examples include the taqman low density microrna array tlda applied biosystems and the rt 2 mirna pcr arrays sabioscience a qiagen companyanother widely used high-throughput technique for analysis of the expression level of mirna molecules is microarray technology the microarray technology was firstly applied to mirna studies in 2003 126 since then numerous approaches based on different microarray platforms have been developed for mirna quantification the basic procedures of mirna quantification using a microarray platform include a mirna probe design and array preparation b isolation of mirna and labeling and c hybridization and signal detection a schematic flow chart of the mirna profiling microarray is shown in fig 2 the design of the microrna probes isolation of microrna from samples and the labeling of mirnas are the most critical procedures in the mirna microarray assaythe short length of mirnas makes design of the probes more difficult because the design of the probe is almost exclusively determined by sequence of the mirna itself sequence of the mirna determines the wider tm distribution of the probes therefore tm normalization of the full set of probes is absolutely required since the hybridization is usually carried out at one temperature to solve this problem two techniques lna utilization or adjusting the lengths of the probes have been successfully used to normalize tm value 127 128 quantity of mirna is also very important for mirna microarray assay since the abundance of mirnas in total rna is very low and a relatively large amount of mirna is needed in comparison to a rt-pcr assay conventional denaturing urea-acrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with a commercialized kit eg the mirvana microrna isolation kit of ambion inc and the purelink microrna isolation kit of invitrogen co has demonstrated excellent efficiency in isolating mirnalabeling of mirna is an absolutely key step for the overall sensitivity of the microarray many methods have been developed to label mirna and these can be classified into two main categories direct labeling and indirect labeling direct labeling with fluorescent dye can be accomplished enzymatically currently used methods include labeling through polya polymerase labeling through t4 rna ligase guanine labeling and labeling microrna through a rna-primed array-based klenow enzyme assay rake fluorescent dye also can conjugate with adjacent 3-oh of mature mirnas using a chemical reagent 129 130 indirect labeling methods include labeling through mirna reverse transcript the rt-pcr product of mirna or the in vitro transcript of mirna the advantages of indirect labeling are obvious since the reverse transcription product of mirnas is more stable and easy to preserve in addition mirna can be amplified and labeled synchronously through pcr or in vitro transcription which is very useful for low-abundance mirnas although direct labeling is simple this method has inherent problems including the fact that guanine labeling is not suitable for mirnas lacking g residues that t4 ligase labeling can introduce base bias and that the procedure of chemical labeling is somewhat complicated though indirect labeling is more sensitive this method may introduce artificial errors during the ligation and pcr amplification proceduresanother microarray technique which uses biotin-labeled mirnas to hybridize with lan probes has been coupled to xmap suspension microspheres luminex co to offer more rapid and reproducible results than does solid planar array due to its favorable reaction kinetics in liquid phase using this technique a single nt difference can be discriminated 131 microarray technology has proven to be standard technique for profiling mirna expression however due to relatively low specificity and reduced dynamic range compared to other methods the results obtained from microarray often require the validation via rt-qpcrnext-generation sequencing ngs is also called massively parallel or deep sequencing and is becoming the most effective method for mirna analysis sequence throughput of ngs is unapproachable by other mirna analysis technique since they lay dna fragments on a single chip and simultaneous sequencing up to millions of these fragments in parallel the principle of ngs has been described in other chapter of this book and elsewhere 132 133 currently three main platforms are in widespread use for mirna profiling and discovery the roche 454 gs flx sequencer the illumina genome analyzer and the applied biosystems solid sequencer the methodologies of the ngs for mirna analysis are similar and include srna isolation library preparation sequencing and data analysis in addition to increased throughput ngs technique significantly reduces cloning biases observed with traditional capillary sequencing since sequence reads are generated from fragment libraries that dont need to be cloned and amplifiedanother key advantage of ngs over microarrays in mirna study is that it can profile unknown genes since no sequence-specific probes are needed for detection currently most novel mirnas have been discovered and characterized through ngs ngs can also gauge mirna expression level by counting clone frequencies which has demonstrated more sensitivity than microarrays 132 one disadvantage of ngs to comprehensively profile mrna expression is that this technique is rather expensive compared to microarray though its cost has significantly decreased with the development of commercial platforms another limitation of ngs is that the read length is relatively short 35500 bp compared to traditional capillary sequencing 10001200 bp this limits their use for de novo assembly of complete genomes but makes them become the ideal instruments for mirna profiling since the length of mirnas 2135 nucleotides is shorter than the read length of ngsas described above each technique for mirna detection has its advantages and disadvantages the method used should best fit the research goal and experimental conditions for example for new mirna discovery and identification in addition to sequencing technique cloning of mirna may be the simplest method in situ hybridization is more suitable for location of mirna in tissue northern blotting is very sensitive but it is very time-consuming and not practical in large clinical studies for routine detection of the expression of hundreds of mirnas rt-qpcr is able to detect low copy numbers with high sensitivity and specificity when studying the expression levels of multi-mirnas simultaneously microarray and sequencing may be the best choice another important problem is that although each platform is relatively stable in terms of its own microrna profiling intra-reproducibility the inter-platform reproducibility among different platforms is low 134 an industry standard for analysis of mirna expression awaits further advances in both technology and computation 135the growing interest in developing circulating mirnas as blood-based biomarkers in the diagnostic microbiology field necessitates very careful consideration of the effects of various pre-analytical and analytical parameters on their quantification to ensure that mirna quantification is not affected by the technical variability that may be introduced at the multiple different analysis steps and to minimize any other potential effect of non-biological variation in the quantification results it is important to select and identify stable mirnas as normalizers and to choose the right normalization approachesthe correct quantification of mirna transcripts in clinical samples should include data normalization using both endogenous and exogenous control mirnas 136138 the selection of endogenous control mirnas is necessary to avoid false negative results due to a bad sample quality but it is difficult in this case a mirna gene that is expected to be stably expressed in all analyzed samples should be selected as an endogenous control preferably target mrna levels should be normalized using as mirna normalizers control genes belonging to the same rna class 139 based on the same concept normalization of mirna levels should be based on endogenous control genes that belong to the small noncoding rna family ncrna of rnas such as small nuclear rnas snrna it is important to note that the endogenous mirnas should meet the following characteristics in order to be used as mirna normalizer a the mirna normalizer should be highly expressed in most samples b the mirna normalizer should show invariable expression across the test sample and c the mirna normalizer should have equivalent extraction and quantification efficiency with the target mirnas in order to avoid misinterpreted data and to identify true changes in mirna expression levels it is important to select the correct endogenous mirna normalizer different algorithms can be used to select the best endogenous mirna normalizer including genorm 140 normfinder 141 and bestkeeper 142 in most cases reported so far researchers select their endogenous reference genes for mirna quantification according to reports in the literature or based on distinguishable low standard deviations sd in mirna microarrays data in the majority of studies a relative quantification rq step is included to compare the expression levels of target mirna gene with the expression of an endogenous reference gene based on the cq approach as described by livak and schmittgen 143 therefore in each case different mirna normalizers should be first evaluated and then established for different sample types the combination of several normalizers might be more appropriate than a single universal normalizer 144 it is crucial to mention that the selection of a gene as a mirna normalizer should always follow validation screening tests on a subset of samples under analysisthe inclusion of synthetic mirnas as exogenous controls added to samples prior to any analysis step is also very important for mirna quantification this is the only way to correct the different recovery rates for each sample during the various steps of mirna isolation and pcr amplification between individual clinical samples exogenous synthetic mirnas have been used as external controls for data normalization of sample-to-sample variations in rna isolation 136 137 145 the synthetic mirna is added to all the plasma aliquots as an exogenous mirna spiked-in control after the addition of the denaturating solution to avoid differences in template quality and warrant efficiency of the reverse transcription reaction several synthetic mirnas have been used so far including c elegans mirna cel-mir-39 which is the almost widely used 136 146 mirnas quanto ec1 and quanto ec2 147 and the simian virus gene sv40 148  we have to point out that using only spike-in mirna controls for the quantification of mirna expression in clinical samples is not correct since in this case only the handling of experiments is considered but not the sample quality several studies have shown that normalization should be based on a combination of an endogenous and an exogenous control mirna since in this case differences in mirna recovery and differences in cdna synthesis between samples are compensated 136 137 145concerning mirna profiling by using microarrays technology the normalization methods have not been investigated in detail so far one of the most widely used normalization methods in this case is based on the mean expression value of all mirnas 149 however quantile normalization is also a popular method for large-scale mrna array expression 150152 while rank-invariant set normalization 153 has been also used the first normalization methods that were used with mirna array data employed centering to median values 154 155 or scaling based on total array intensities 156 variance stabilizing normalization vsn methods have also been applied to mirna array data 157 158 normalization procedures based on the set of invariants and quantile were the most robust over all experimental conditions tested suo et al and pradervand et al evaluated the effectiveness of these methods by comparing the normalized microarray data to qpcr data the correlation between the microarray and qpcr data tended to be low 157 158chronic active epstein-barr virus ebv infection has high mortality and morbidity 9294 to explore the biomarkers for disease severity and prognosis kawano et al assessed the 12 plasma mirna expression levels encoded by ebv 159 they found that virus-encoded mir-bart1-5p mir-bart2-5p mir-bart5 and mir-bart22 levels in patients with chronic active ebv infection were significantly greater than those in patients with infectious mononucleosis and in controls plasma mir-bart2-5p mir-bart4 mir-bart7 mir-bart13 mir-bart15 and mir-bart22 levels were significantly increased in the patients with systemic symptoms compared with levels in patients without systemic symptoms the levels of mir-bart2-5p 13 and 15 showed clinical cutoff values associated with specific clinical conditions in contrast to plasma ebv loads which can serve as the potentially biomarkers of disease severity or progress 159polyomaviruses are ubiquitous species-specific viruses that belong to the papovaviridae family 160 jc and bk polyomaviruses were first described in the 1970s and are the two most commonly recognized human polyomaviruses 160 jc polyomavirus causes a fatal central nervous system demyelinating disease known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy pml in immunocompromised individuals or individuals being treated with potent immunosuppressive therapies 161 162 jc polyomavirus is a dna tumor virus that has a double-stranded dna genome encoding a well-studied oncogene large t antigen 163 the expression of the jc polyomavirus mirnas has been investigated after infection in vitro 164 the jc polyomavirus expressed several mirnas jc-mirna-3p and jc-mirna-5p 164 jc polyomavirus also encodes another microrna jcv-mir-j1 the expression of jcv-mir-j1-5p and its variant jcv-mir-j1a-5p in 50 healthy subjects was investigated 165 the overall detection rate of jcpyv mirna was 74 3750 in plasma and 62 3150 in urine the detection rate was 86 1214 and 57 814 of plasma and urine samples in seronegative subjects while the detection rate was 69 2536 and 64 2336 in seropositive subjects furthermore in seropositive subjects shedding virus in urine higher levels of urinary viral mirnas were observed compared to non-shedding seropositive subjects 165bk polyomavirus is the cause of nephritis in renal transplant patients and often results in graft loss 160 166 bk polyomavirus is latent in the urogenital tract and is able to reactivate and replicate in the nucleus of renal epithelial tubular cells of the transplanted kidney 160 167 bk polyomavirus-specific bkv-mir-b1-5p jc polyomavirus-specific jcv-mir-j1-5p and bkv-mir-b1-3pjcv-mir-j1-3p sharing identical sequences between the two viruses were analyzed from body fluids diagnosed with or suspected of a severe polyomavirus-associated disease 167 the mirnas frequently amplified from human plasma urine and cerebrospinal fluid samples bkv-mir-b1-5p was amplified from one-third of the samples which often contained high viral dna loads their diagnosis and management significances in severe polyomavirus-associated diseases need further clinical evaluation 167diagnosis and monitoring of sepsis can be difficult because many of its signs and symptoms can be caused by other noninfectious disorders 1 2 4 8 the current gold standard for diagnosing septicemia is the blood culture which generally takes several days or longer other early biomarkers of sepsis are being investigated these include acute phase proteins c-reactive protein cytokines il-1 il-6 il-10 and tnf-a chemokines il-8 mcp-1 and g-csf procalcitonin and metabonomic 1 2 4 8 to date these biomarkers have not demonstrated sufficient sensitivity andor specificity to guide clinical management host mirna expression profiles have been intensively studied using both in vitro or in vivo models of inflammation 33 34 168 169 some of these studies use escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide lps stimulation as a trigger 170 for example expression of mir-146 mir-155 and mir-132 increased in human acute monocytic leukemia cell line thp-1 in response to lps stimulation 171 upregulation of mir-155 mir-223 and mir-146a and downregulation of mir-125b mir-144 and mir-1425p have been observed in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells by ceppi et al 172 schmidt et al screened for differentially expressed mirnas in circulating leukocytes using an in vivo model of acute inflammation also triggered by lps 170 they found that four mirnas were downregulated mir-146b mir-150 mir-342 and let-7 g and one was upregulated mir-143vasilescu et al profiled genome-wide mirnas by microarray in peripheral blood leukocytes of sepsis patients and found that mir-150 mir-182 mir-342-5p and mir-486 expression profiles differentiated sepsis patients from healthy controls 33 moreover mir-150 levels were significantly reduced in plasma samples of sepsis patients and correlated with the level of disease severity finally these investigators noted that the plasma levels ratio for mir-150interleukin-18 can be used for assessing the severity of the sepsis more recently wang et al have analyzed seven mirnas expression levels in patients diagnosed with sepsis systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs and healthy controls using a rt-qpcr assay 34 they determined serum mir-146a and mir-223 were significantly reduced in septic patients compared with sirs patients and healthy controls the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of mir-146a mir-223 and il-6 were 0858 0804 and 0785 respectivelywith approximately nine million new cases of tuberculosis tb each year tuberculosis remains a global scourge 173 174 moreover the emergence and increase in highly resistant strains as well as the emergence of functionally untreatable tb have made the diagnosis and control of tb particularly important 175 the gold standard for the diagnosis of tb continues to be the growth of mycobacterium tuberculosis in selective media but this culture in clinical specimens requires long incubation time 312 weeks due to the slow growth of m tuberculosis 173 the diagnostic usefulness of interferon-gamma-releasing assays has been reviewed the t-spot tb assay has proven to be a helpful adjunct test for diagnosing tb 176 additional accurate tuberculosis-specific biomarkers are needed 177 human and mycobacterial mirnas are being evaluated for their usefulness as tuberculosis-specific biomarkers 7 178 179 studies have shown that mir-155 and mir-155 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs isolated from active tb atb patients exhibited characteristic expression under purified protein derivative ppd challenge 180 mirna expression profiles have been shown to be different in pbmcs from patients with active tb latent tb infection ltb and healthy controls 181 differences in mirna expression of whole blood between tb and sarcoidosis sarc were also detected 182 the expression levels of mirnas in serum samples from 30 patients with active tuberculosis have been profiled 183 ninety-seven mirnas were differentially expressed in pulmonary tb patient sera compared with healthy controls 90 upregulated and 7 downregulated following rt-qpcr confirmation and receiver operating characteristic roc curve analysis three mirnas mir-361-5p mir-889 and mir-576-3p were shown to distinguish tb-infected patients from healthy controls and other microbial infections with moderate sensitivity and specificity area under curve auc value range 07110848 multiple logistic regression analysis of a combination of these three mirnas showed an enhanced ability to discriminate between these two groups with an auc value of 0863 184 fu et al also explore the potential roles of circulating mirnas in active pulmonary tuberculosis infection they found that 59 mirnas were downregulated and 33 mirnas were upregulated in the tb serum compared to their levels in the control serum interestingly only two differentially expressed mirnas were increased not only in the serum but also in the sputum of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared to the levels for the healthy controls their results indicated that upregulated mir-29a could discriminate tb patients from healthy controls with reasonable sensitivity and specificity 185 zhang et al employed qpcr assay to detect the expression level of mir-183 in blood from tb patients and healthy individuals expression level of mir-183 was found to be increased in serum samples from tb patients compared with healthy controls further analysis revealed that mir-183 level is positively associated with the activity of macrophages from tb patients 186 references 158163 dont make sense in that the topics in these references are not about tbpertussis also known as whooping cough is caused by bordetella pertussis b pertussis 187 despite high levels of vaccination b pertussis continues to circulate in asia europe the united states australia and other countries making pertussis a reemerging disease 188192 it is clear that the diagnosis of pertussis is still relevant despite ongoing efforts to improve pertussis vaccines 192 the serum mirna profile in pertussis patients was investigated in order to explore its potential as a novel diagnostic biomarker for pertussis 193 serum mirna profile in pertussis patients was analyzed using a mirna array 50 mirnas were overexpressed and 81 were under-expressed in the serum of pertussis patients 193 expression levels of seven candidate mirnas were further evaluated by real-time rt-qpcr a panel of five mirnas mir-202 mir-342-5p mir-206 mir-487b mir-576-5p was confirmed as being overexpressed in pertussis patients 193 risk score and receiver operating characteristic roc curve analysis showed that the area under the curve of the five-member mirna profile was 0980 at an optimal cutoff value 0707 this panel of mirnas yielded a sensitivity of 974 and a specificity of 943 these data suggest that this five-member serum mirna profile may serve as a new biomarker for pertussis diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity 193varicella also called chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus 194196 although varicella vaccination has become routine for all children at 1215 months of age in the united states germany australia and korea 196 outbreaks of varicella are still seen in the community 194 expression levels of mirnas in serum samples from 29 patients with varicella were analyzed using tlda 197 the array results showed that 247 mirnas were differentially expressed in sera of the varicella patients compared with healthy controls 215 upregulated and 32 downregulated through the following rt-qpcr confirmation and receiver operating characteristic roc curve analysis five mirnas mir-197 mir-629 mir-363 mir-132 and mir-122 were shown to distinguish varicella patients from healthy controls and other microbial infections with moderate sensitivity and specificity 197 li et al found that six mirnas including mir-190b mir-571 mir-1276 mir-1303 mir-943 and mir-661 exhibited significant higher expression levels more than fourfold in herpes zoster hz patients compared with those of healthy controls and herpes simplex virus hsv patients 197 the altered mirna could be potentially used as biomarkers to test for latent hz infection 198 199novel human influenza a virus strains continue to emerge and evolve from avian influenza strains and result in yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics 200 the latest of these zoonotic avian influenza a strains to infection humans is the h7n9 avian influenza strain 201 202 mirna regulates host immune response and pathogenesis during influenza a infection and modulated viral replication 203 serum mirna profile in response to h7n9 virus infection has been characterized using tlda 61 upon infection a total of 395 mirnas were expressed in the serum pool of patients far beyond the 221 in healthy controls among the 187 commonly expressed mirnas 146 were upregulated and only 7 were downregulated in patients further analysis by quantitative rt-pcr revealed that the serum levels of mir-17 mir-20a mir-106a and mir-376c were significantly elevated in patients compared with healthy individuals roc curves were constructed to show that each mirna could discriminate h7n9 patients from controls with auc values ranging from 0622 to 0898 whereas a combination of mir-17 mir-20a mir-106a and mir-376c obtained a higher discriminating ability with an auc value of 096 these findings reveal significant alterations in serum mirna expression following influenza virus infection 61 and confirm the great potential of circulating mirnas for the diagnosis of influenza and other viral diseases 5 203infection with hiv-1 leads to a systemic destruction of t cells and diminished cell-mediated immunity resulting in a wide range of opportunistic infections as well as cancers 204 although treatment with antiretroviral therapy increases the survival of hiv-infected individuals it does not result in eradication of infection 205 moreover efforts to vaccinate against hiv-1 have not been successful 206 hiv-1 is known to persist in resting t cells and also may persist in different cell types 205 understanding the role that mirnas may play in the pathogenesis of hiv-1 may allow different approaches to both antiretroviral therapy and vaccine development 4547 207 studies have shown the different expression pattern of mirnas in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs cd4 t cells cd8 t cells and monocytes from hiv-1-infected subjects 207 for instance wang et al have reported that four mirnas mirna-28 mirna-150 mirna-223 and mirna-382 showed different expression levels between monocytes and macrophages in hiv infection 50 a cohort of 128 plasma samples from hiv-1-infected subjects and 37 samples from healthy donors have been analyzed in the light of hiv-1-infected patients with low 200 celll medium 200350 celll and high 350 celll cd4 t cell count ltc mtc and htc of the 754 host mirnas excluding endogenous controls incorporated in the array 232 346 316 and 258 mirnas were detected in plasma of healthy controls ltc mtc and htc groups respectively a total of 297 mirnas differentially expressed in ltc subjects of which 273 were upregulated and 24 were downregulated compared to healthy controls similarly a total of 257 mirnas 236 upregulated and 21 downregulated were differentially regulated in mtc subjects compared to healthy controls however in the htc group only 127 mirnas 85 upregulated and 42 downregulated were differentially regulated compared to healthy controls fifteen mirnas mir-29a mir-223 mir-27a mir-19b mir-151-3p mir-28-5p mir-766 mir-30a-3p mir-136 mir-125b mir-18a mir-769 mir-942 mir-1197 and mir-518b were randomly selected for further analysis among these seven mirnas mir-1197 mir-766 mir-136 mir-151-3p mir-518b mir-769 and mir-942 were commonly dysregulated in all three groups the other eight mirnas were upregulated expression in ltc and mtc groups compared controls a combination of nine mirnas mir-29a mir-223 mir-27a mir-19b mir-151-3p mir-28-5p mir-766 mir-30a-3p and mir-136 were found to distinguish the hiv-1-infected patients from healthy controls with sensitivity of 961 and specificity of 973 and auc  0994 208 seven of them were significantly associated with cd4 t cell count and thus have a great potential to serve as biomarkers for monitoring the hiv immune statushepatitis b virus hpv infects the liver and causes acute andor chronic liver diseases that may progress to cirrhosis of the liver or to hepatocellular carcinoma 209 hbv infection is also known to modulate the expression of host cellular mirnas which then participate in development of hbv-related liver diseases 210 211 the mirna profiles in chronic hepatitis b patient tissues or in hbv-expressing cells have been reviewed by liu et al 212 li et al profiled serum mirnas of healthy controls hbv- hcv- and hbv-positive hepatocellular carcinoma hcc-affected individuals by solexa sequencing followed by validation with quantitative rt-pcr assay 34 these investigators successfully identified 13 mirnas that are differentially expressed in hbv serum this 13-mirna-based biomarker accurately discriminated not only hbv cases from controls and hcv cases but also hbv-positive hcc cases from control and hbv cases for example when using four markers mir-375 mir-10a mir-223 and mir-423 to separate the control and hbv groups the auc was 999  01 sensitivity 993 specificity 988 similarly two markers mir-92a and mir-423 could separate the control and hcv groups with a high specificity and sensitivity auc 996  04 sensitivity 979 specificity 994 the control and hbv-positive hcc group could be clearly separated by five markers mir-23b mir-423 mir-375 mir- 23a and mir-342-3p auc 999  01 sensitivity 969 specificity 994 similarly the hbv and the hbv-positive hcc group could be separated by two markers mir-10a and mir-125b auc 992  06 sensitivity 985 specificity 985 34another study profiled mirna expression on pooled sera obtained from identified groups of chronic asymptomatic carriers asc patients with chronic hepatitis b chb and hbv-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure aclf as well as healthy controls hc using applied biosystems taqmanarray assay 213 a total of 37 mirnas were amplified from hc whereas 77 101 and 135 were amplified from asc chb and aclf respectively the expression levels of most mirnas were also upregulated in hbv-infected patients when compared to hc furthermore the level of mirnas in the chb serum was upregulated most in hepatitis b e antigen-positive patients the expression of mir-122 the most abundant mirna in liver tissue was significantly higher in hbv-infected groups than in hc the expression of mir-223 was similar between hc and asc but increased significantly in chb and aclf the expression levels of mir-122 and mir-194 correlated negatively with the age of patients with chb or aclfhepatitis c virus hcv also infects the liver and causes hepatitis cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma 214 mirnas are thought to regulate multiple aspects of hcv live cycles certain mirnas appear to serve as essential mediators for interferon-based antiviral therapy 215 216 in an in vitro acute hcv infection model 108 human mirnas were identified whose expression levels changed for more than 20-fold in response to hcv infection 217 marquez et al measured mir-122 and mir-21 levels in hcv-infected human liver biopsies relative to uninfected human livers and correlated these with clinical patient data 218 they found that mir-21 expression correlated with viral load fibrosis and serum liver transaminase levels while mir-122 expression inversely correlated with fibrosis liver transaminase levels and patient age morita et al has described hepatic mir-122 expression that was weakly and positively correlated with the serum hcv load but was not correlated with hcv load in the human liver 219bihrer et al found that sera from patients with chronic hcv infection contained higher levels of mir-122 than sera from healthy controls 36 serum mir-122 levels correlated well with markers of liver inflammatory activity that is the serum levels of alanine leucine transaminase alt and aspartate transaminase and the histologic activity index hai score in patients with persistently normal alt levels serum mir-122 levels did not differ from healthy controls there was no correlation of serum mir-122 levels with serum albumin international normalized ratio liver fibrosis or serum hcv rna thus serum mir-122 appears to act as a biomarker of necroinflammation in patients with chronic hepatitis c infectionenteroviruses are common causes of human infections with a diverse array of clinical features ranging from gastroenteritis to meningoencephalitis and myocarditis to pleuritis 220 the role of mirnas in the pathogenesis of enterovirus infections are becoming appreciated although not yet fully understood 221 a comprehensive mirna profiling in ev71-infected hep2 cells using deep sequencing has been performed 222 a total of 64 mirnas were found whose expression levels changed for more than twofold in response to ev71 infection 222 ho et al found that upregulation of mir-141 upon enterovirus infection can facilitate viral propagation by expediting the translational switch 223 host serum mirna levels in patients with hand-foot-and-mouth disease caused by enterovirus 71 ev71 and coxsackievirus 16 cva16 as well as in other microbial infections and in healthy individuals have been compared 224 among 664 different mirnas analyzed using a mirna array 102 were upregulated and 26 were downregulated in sera of patients with enteroviral infections expression levels of ten candidate mirnas were further evaluated by quantitative real-time pcr assays a receiver operating characteristic roc curve analysis revealed that six mirnas mir-148a mir-143 mir-324-3p mir-628-3p mir-140-5p and mir-362-3p were able to discriminate patients with enterovirus infections from healthy controls with area under curve auc values ranged from 0828 to 0934 the combined six mirna using multiple logistic regression analysis provided not only a sensitivity of 971 and a specificity of 927 but also a unique profile that differentiated enteroviral infections from other microbial infections expression levels of five mirnas mir-148a mir-143 mir-324-3p mir-545 and mir-140-5p were significantly increased in patients with cva16 versus those with ev71 p  005 combination of mir-545 mir-324-3p and mir-143 possessed a moderate ability to discrimination between cva16 and ev71 with an auc value of 0761 these data indicate that sera from patients with different subtypes of enteroviral infection express unique mirna profiles serum mirna expression profiles may provide supplemental biomarkers for diagnosing and subtyping enteroviral hand-foot-and-mouth disease infections 224cytomegalovirus cmv is an important human pathogen that is often asymptomatic until the infected individual becomes immunosuppressed 71 cmv mirna is currently under investigation 72 plasma levels of 11 human- and 3 cmv-encoded mirnas were quantitated by real-time pcr in 13 infants with congenital cmv infection the levels of mir-183-5p and mir-210-3p were significantly higher in patients with congenital cmv infection than in control infants the results indicated that plasma mirnas could be associated with the pathogenesis of congenital cmv infection and could be used as disease biomarkers 225ebola virus ebov is a filovirus that initially infects dendritic cells and macrophages which leads to lethal infections in humans and primates 226 ebov mirnas have been identified and may serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis and therapy of ebola viral infections 227 ebov-induced changes in circulating mirna populations of nonhuman primates and humans have been investigated 228 eight mirnas including hsa-mir-146a-5p hsa-mir-18b-5p hsa-mir-21-3p hsa-mir-22-3p hsa-mir-29a-3p hsa-mir-432-5p hsa-mir-511-5p and hsa-mir-596 can correctly categorize infection status in 6474 86 human and nonhuman primates samples 228dengue is currently regarded as the most prevalent and rapidly spreading mosquito-borne virus 229 efforts have been made at increasing our understanding of the pathogenesis and immunology of this viral infection 230 231 among these advances in knowledge are the roles of mirnas in dengue 232 expression levels of mirnas in serum samples from three patients with dengue virus type 1 denv-1 and three healthy volunteers were separately analyzed using mirna pcr arrays 210 the expressions of the five selected mirnas were verified by rt-qpcr serummir-21-5p mir-146a-5p mir-590-5p mir-188-5p and mir-152-3p were identified as promising serum indicators for dengue infection 233parasitic infections continue to have high morbidity and mortality rates on humans newly recognized insight has resulted from genetic studies 210 and microrna studies 234236 the expression levels of circulating mirnas were also analyzed in filarial- toxoplasma gondii- and plasmodium vivax-infected patients 237239 these studies proved that altered plasma or serum mirnas were useful as the biomarker for the detection of parasite infection for example serum mir-223 could serve as a potential new biomarker for the detection of schistosome infection and the assessment of the response to chemotherapy plasma mir-451 and mir-16 are relevant biomarkers for malaria infection mir-71 and mir-34 discriminated onchocerca volvulus-infected samples from uninfected samplescirculating mirnas have been investigated as the diagnosis or prognosis marker for microbial infections studies on host mirna profiles for microbial infections are underway host mirna profiles have a considerable way to go before they will be ready for use in clinical practice several issues remain to be clarified in this field a source material should be fixed plasma serum whole blood and isolated exosomes or microvesicles have been used as the source for mirna profiling advantages and disadvantages of each source should be considered prior to selecting the source b though differences in circulating mirnas between males and females have not been found with the exception of differences associated with pregnancy 240 241 mirna levels in plasma and serum from a large number of normal individuals of both genders and various ages even the same individual over time should be extensively studied c no acknowledged reference genes have been found in serumplasma commonly used endogenous controls such as mir-16 are dysregulated in some diseases rnu6b is degraded in serum spiking into rna isolation processes with synthetic exogenous mirna only acts as a normalizers for differences in recovery between samples d the methods of mirna quantification including rna isolation should be standardized since inter-platform reproducibility among different platforms is low e it seems to lack of specificity using single mirna as biomarker since the mirna commonly regulated in various disease a panel of mirnas would be a best choices100a12 also referred to as calgranulin c belongs to the calgranulin subfamily of the highly conserved s100 proteins 1 2 the s100 superfamily of ef-hand proteins has a high ca2-binding capacity and binding sites for other divalent cations such as zn2 and cu2 oligomerization in the presence of ca2 and zn2 has been shown to be essential for the target protein interaction and function of s100a12 35intracellular s100a12 protein is mainly localized to the cytosol and a number of different target proteins of s100a12 suggest that this protein has regulatory functions 68 extracellular s100a12 has cytokine-like effects and functions as a phagocyte-specific danger-associated molecule alarmin with a central role in immune responses 9 s100a12 plays a role in host defense against microorganisms and parasites 10 by sequestering essential trace elements such as cu2 3 and the protein also has chemotactic properties especially for monocytes and mast cells 6 11 12 s100a12 has also been suggested to counteract tissue damage by competing with matrix metalloproteinases mmps for zn2-binding 13 the s100a12 protein is a ligand for the pattern recognition receptor rage receptor for advanced glycation end products and activates the nuclear factor kappa b nf-kb pathway 6 14 a mechanism linked to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease ibd in humans 6 15 16in human medicine s100a12 has been reported to be a sensitive and specific marker of localized inflammatory disease processes such as gastrointestinal inflammation and to be increased in fecal samples from patients with ibd active crohns disease and ulcerative colitis 16 17 recent studies suggest that fecal s100a12 concentrations may also be clinically useful as a biomarker of inflammation in dogs 18 19 in dogs with chronic idiopathic gastrointestinal inflammation ibd fecal canine s100a12 concentrations were increased and correlated with the severity of clinical disease endoscopic changes observed in the intestine and the severity of histologic lesions in the colon 18 higher fecal s100a12 concentrations were also shown to be associated with a negative outcome in dogs with ibd 19 the role of s100a12 as a biomarker of inflammation is currently an area of intensive research in both human and veterinary medicine and targeting the rage-s100a12 axis may also open new therapeutic avenuesonly very few studies have been published about the effect of enteric parasite infections 20 or enteropathogenic viruses 17 on fecal s100a12 concentrations in humans and the role of s100a12 in parasite and viral infections is difficult to study using a traditional rodent animal model due to the lack of s100a12 in rodents 21 although the function of s100a12 may be species-specific the existence of a homologue of this calgranulin protein in dogs 22 appears to render the dog an ideal model for studying s100a12 biology and the rage-s100a12 axis in human patientsto the authors knowledge the possibility of an effect of gastrointestinal pathogens on fecal s100a12 concentrations in dogs has not yet been evaluated and reported but this information will also be important for any further evaluation of the clinical utility of fecal s100a12 as a biomarker in dogs with ibd based on the literature available 10 17 20 we hypothesized that infections with enteric parasites - but not enteropathogenic viruses - are associated with increased fecal canine s100a12 concentrations and that these etiologies need to be ruled out when using fecal s100a12 as a biomarker in dogs with ibd thus the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the presence and numbers of selected endoparasites and viral agents that are frequently encountered and known to cause gastrointestinal signs in dogs on fecal canine s100a12 concentrations in a large cohort of puppies because biomarkers can be affected by patient physiological factors such as age sex or size 23 the effect of these parameters was also evaluateda total of 307 purebred dogs  13 weeks of age from several n  33 french breeding kennels from a total of 67 litters were included in this study these dogs were apparently healthy with the exception that some dogs had an abnormal fecal consistency details about the characteristics of these dogs some of which were included in a previous study have been published 24 the breeders consent was obtained prior to enrollment of dogs and fecal sample collectiona fecal specimen was collected from each dog after natural defecation and was prepared and stored as previously described 24 depending on the mean adult body weight of their respective breed puppies were categorized into small breed dogs  25 kg average adult body weight or large breed dogs  25 kg average adult weight 25 for each puppy fecal quality was evaluated by a single operator ag using a 13-point semiquantitative scale 113 from liquid to dry consistency as previously described 25 thresholds for an abnormal fecal consistency were applied dependent on breed size and age feces with a score of  5 were considered abnormal for large breed puppies regardless of age whereas for small breed puppies fecal scores  6 and  7 were classified as abnormal for 4- to 5-week-old puppies and for older puppies respectively 25 following stool collection a rectal swab was collected from each dog for viral pathogen analysis 24fecal samples were tested for the major enteropathogens causing diarrhea in weanling puppies toxocara canis cystoisospora spp giardia spp canine coronavirus and canine parvovirus type 2 as previously described 24briefly an aliquot approximately 5 g of each fecal sample was used for routine fecal examination using the standard mcmaster flotation technique and a second aliquot approximately 100 mg feces was used to quantify giardia spp antigen prospect-giardia microplate elisa kit remel france per gram of wet feces 24the fecal material obtained via rectal swab was tested for the presence of ccv-rna and cpv2-dna by qrt-pcr and qpcr respectively 24 25 results from duplicate pcr analyses from the extracted dna ie 2 pcr assay were performed for each fecal extract were expressed semi-quantitatively as virus loads puppies were classified as infected by cpv2 and ccv if viral loads were  10103 and  1093 copies respectively 24 25another single-spot fecal aliquot 08  02 g from each dog was separated and stored frozen -20 c until shipped to the gastrointestinal laboratory at texas am university where this set of samples was processed within 4 weeks and analyzed within 7 months fecal s100a12 concentrations were measured in 6 batches of all specimens using an established and validated species-specific in-house 125i-radioimmunoassay 26 all samples were analyzed using the same batch of 125i-labelled s100a12 and other assay reagentsassumptions of normal distribution and equal variances of numerical data were tested using a shapiro-wilk w and a brown-forsythe test respectively all summary

authors knowledge the present study is the first to evaluate fecal s100a12 concentrations in apparently healthy dogs shedding enteropathogens ie parasites viral agents or both these preliminary data are important for further studies evaluating fecal s100a12 concentrations in dogs with chronic gastrointestinal diseases and are also of comparative relevance given the limitations of studying the effects of similar enteropathogens on fecal s100a12 concentrations in humansthis study showed that fecal s100a12 concentrations in puppies are not affected by an infection with toxocara canis or giardia sp in contrast the presence of the parasite genera cystoisospora spp - independent of their number or subspecies - as well as an infection with the viral pathogens ccv or cpv2 were shown to be associated with alterations in fecal s100a12 concentrations on univariate analysis but not in a multivariate model thus infections with enteropathogens evaluated in this study are not primarily associated with alterations in fecal s100a12 concentrations whereas the concentration of fecal s100a12 is affected by the fecal score which reflects the overall health of the digestive tract this is important for further studies evaluating fecal s100a12 concentrations in patients with suspected chronic gastrointestinal inflammation 27 these findings are consistent with the results of a previous investigation in asymptomatic children showing fecal s100a12 concentrations to only have a tendency to be increased with concurrent giardia duodenalis and helminth infections 20 also the concentrations of fecal s100a12 measured in the study by garzn et al 20 were comparable to those concentrations detected in our study our results further agree with a previous study in adult people revealing no differences in fecal s100a12 concentrations in patients with viral gastroenteritis caused by norwalk-like virus or rotavirus 17no difference in fecal s100a12 concentrations were detected between puppies testing positive for enteropathogens except for cystoisospora spp ccv and cpv2 in univariate analysis and those dogs testing negative in this study this was still an unexpected finding given that s100a12 has been shown to have filariostatic or filaricidal properties anti-parasite mechanism through its binding to parasite paramyosin 10 28 and the fact that s100a12 can be expressed in eosinophils in humans 29 however though endoparasites are more likely to be associated with eosinophilic or mixed inflammation 30 whether s100a12 expression in eosinophils is also induced or up-regulated in the context of inflammation in dogs has not been investigated also experimental infection in cattle with echinococcus granulosus was associated with a strong s100a12 response 31 however infection with e granulosus results in a more granulomatous type of inflammation although other cells were also shown to express s100a12 at the site of infection-associated inflammation these findings further suggest that limiting the availability of transition metal ions ie ca2 zn2 and mn2 is not the mechanism of action to combat parasite or viral infections as opposed to infections with bacterial pathogens 32 or at least that s100a12 may not play a significant role in it though not demonstrated for s100a12 antimicrobial activity against e coli has been shown for canine calprotectin 33correlation of fecal s100a12 concentrations with only the fecal score and breed size suggests that fecal s100a12 concentrations are not primarily influenced by any single endoparasite or viral pathogen that were evaluated in this study however diarrhea in puppies is often multifactorial 24 and other factors that can influence the fecal score eg stress diet change or other environmental factors may also affect fecal s100a12 concentrations in dogs the effect of dietary factors eg diet type feeding practices dietary supplements amount of milk ingested by suckling on fecal s100a12 concentrations could not be evaluated in this study due to the large variety of these factors and the fact that the quantity of milk ingested cannot be determined however the association between fecal score and fecal s100a12 concentrations could also reflect an infection with another enteropathogen or enteropathogens for which puppies in this study were not evaluated small breed size was another significant factor for having an increased fecal s100a12 concentration in this study contrary to this large breed size has been previously shown to be a determinant of lower fecal consistency 25 and this variable had been taken into account when interpreting fecal scores normalabnormal in this study thus one possible explanation for small breed dogs having a higher frequency of abnormal stools in this study could be an undetected infectious cause or environmental factors however lack of an ability of the 13-point scoring system 25 to sufficiently differentiate fecal qualities may also explain this finding though this scoring system has been validated for use in puppies and appears to be superior to the 5-point system 34 that is often used to differentiate fecal qualities the relationship between fecal s100a12 concentrations fecal score and breed size as well as its clinical implication and whether the current results also translate to those in adult dogs warrants further researchage has previously been reported to have no effect on the fecal concentrations of s100a12 26 but dogs in that former study were significantly older 08111 years median 4 years than the dogs included in the present study 413 weeks median 7 weeks hence age was also evaluated as a potential influencing factor as an age-related effect has been demonstrated for fecal calprotectin concentrations another s100calgranulin protein complex in dogs 24 in contrast to fecal calprotectin age did not have an effect on fecal s100a12 concentrations in dogs similar to previous findings in older puppies and adult dogs 26 the reason for this difference between fecal calprotectin and fecal s100a12 is unknown possible explanations could be that s100a12 leakage into the still maturing gastrointestinal tract is negligible and that s100a12 production may be more specific to cells of the inflammatory response compared to calprotectin however these hypotheses need to be further investigateda reference interval for fecal canine s100a12 concentrations has been previously established  745 ngg using samples from older puppies and adult dogs 26 using this reference interval in puppies appears to be reasonable given that 6 of the dogs in the present study had a fecal s100a12 concentration above the upper limit of the reference interval this fraction is similar to the fraction of the reference population 5 that would be expected to have a fecal s100a12 concentration above the upper limit of the reference interval established by using the central 95th percentile 35 also the upper limit of the reference interval of 745 ngg in dogs is almost identical to that recently reported for children 750 ngg 36 suggesting that fecal s100a12 concentrations in dogs are comparable to those in people as opposed to rodents 21 the s100a12 protein is encoded in the canine genome 22 thus diseases in dogs appear to be an ideal model - and one that is superior to rodent models - for studying s100a12 biology and the rage-s100a12 axis in humans hence future studies into the function and diagnostic utility of the s100a12 protein as well as the s100a12-rage axis in chronic inflammatory conditions and their proposed use as novel selective therapeutic targets should benefit from the present and also future studies in dogswe acknowledge that this study has some limitations first the small sample size in the analyses of subgroups of dogs carries the potential for type ii error secondly spot fecal samples were used for the detection of enteropathogens and also for measuring fecal s100a12 concentrations but the biological variation and distribution of these enteropathogens and the s100a12 protein in fecal specimens in healthy dogs and dogs with gastrointestinal disease has not yet been reported lastly histopathologic evaluation of gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies to determine whether enteropathogen shedding a decreased fecal score or both are associated with any clinically relevant mucosal lesions ie quality and severity of inflammation was not performed in the dogs in this studywe conclude that shedding of the enteropathogens cystoisospora spp toxocara canis giardia sp ccv and cpv2 does not appear to primarily affect fecal s100a12 concentrations in dogs thus the presence of any one of these endoparasites or viral agents appears to be an unlikely cause of altered fecal s100a12 concentrations but the fecal score as an indicator of the overall digestive health is reflected by the fecal s100a12 concentration these preliminary data are an important starting point for further studies evaluating fecal s100a12 concentrations in dogs or when using fecal s100a12 concentrations as a biomarker in patients with chronic idiopathic gastrointestinal inflammation in addition the dog could be considered as an alternative model for studying s100a12 biology in humanscoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is placing unprecedented pressure on healthcare services across the world12 whilst the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 responsible for covid-19 predominantly affects the respiratory tract3 patients with cardiovascular risk factors or established disease4 and those with elevated cardiac biomarkers appear to be more susceptible and to have a worse prognosis56 the mechanisms underlying these initial observations remain unclearearly case reports suggest that covid-19 can cause a wide range of cardiac conditions that include acute myocardial infarction7 myocarditis8 and takotsubo cardiomyopathy9 acute left and right ventricular failure may be a direct consequence of cardiac pathology with the latter also arising secondary to elevations in right ventricular afterload due to pulmonary embolism or pneumonia10 virus particles have been observed in the myocardium and vascular endothelium in patients with covid-19 and cardiogenic shock1112 however the incidence of these cardiac complications and the subsequent implications for treatment and resource allocation are unknown consequently there is an urgent need to better understand the interactions between covid-19 and the heartechocardiography is well placed to help further this understanding being inexpensive portable and widely accessible however a large systematic evaluation of echocardiography in all patients with covid-19 would be highly challenging due to the logistical considerations of testing consumption of personal protective equipment ppe and the risk of further viral transmission we therefore conducted a global survey to capture the findings of echocardiography performed on clinical grounds in patients with confirmed or a high probability of covid-19 we aim to improve our understanding of the cardiac manifestations of covid-19 and to provide insights into the characteristics of patients who would benefit most from echocardiographythis global online survey of echocardiography in patients with covid-19 was designed by the european association of cardiovascular imaging eacvi with input from external international experts13 any transthoracic echocardiogram that was performed on a patient with confirmed or a high probability of covid-19 in the hospital setting was eligible for inclusion patients were imaged as part of routine care and non-identifiable patient data were captured as such this audit did not require individual patient consent and this approach was approved by the european society of cardiology and by local research ethics committeesan online format was developed httpswwwsurveymonkeycomr2fbffqd that allows rapid completion of 11 questions on a smartphone by sonographers or clinicians immediately after completion of the echocardiogram for most questions the operator selects from several pre-specified answers with the option to select multiple answers and to provide free-text comments supplementary material online appendix first several baseline characteristics are recorded age sex comorbidities symptom severity covid-19 status presence of pneumonia and the location in hospital where imaging was performed secondly the indication for imaging is recorded suspected left heart failure suspected right heart failure chest pain with st-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram cardiac biomarker elevation

moderate or severe systolic dysfunction dilatation evidence of new myocardial infarction myocarditis or takotsubo cardiomyopathy right ventricular abnormalities normal mild or moderate or severe systolic dysfunction dilatation d-shaped left ventricle or elevated pulmonary artery pressure or cardiac tamponade the survey then captures whether the echocardiogram changed patient managementthis prospective survey wwwescardioorgeacvisurveys was distributed to the eacvi network and its wider membership1415 to a pre-established european society of cardiology database of cardiologists with an interest in cardiac imaging and to the presidents and chairpersons of national societies and working groups in imaging across the world it was also distributed widely on social media platformssurvey

0005 and in those with elevated cardiac biomarkers compared with the remaining population 39 vs 31 p  0001we report findings from the first international survey of echocardiography in patients with confirmed or suspected covid-19 data from 1216 patients scanned in 69 countries across six continents demonstrated left or right ventricular abnormalities in half of all patients with covid-19 undergoing echocardiography and that these abnormalities were severe in 1 in 7 patients the majority had non-specific patterns of ventricular dysfunction although new myocardial infarction myocarditis and takotsubo cardiomyopathy were observed in a minority of patients echocardiography was reported to directly change patient management in a third of cases including alterations to disease-specific management haemodynamic support and the level of care received by the patientsthe simple online format of this survey allowed rapid capture of the echocardiographic findings from a large number of patients with covid-19 during the pandemics peak this was facilitated by our ability to disseminate and to publicize the survey via social media and through an established global network of imaging specialists this format allowed us to keep pace with the rapid spread of covid-19 around the world most scans were performed in the current epicentres of the outbreak the uk italy spain france and the usa while undoubtedly a global survey our data remain representative of the current geographical distribution of the viruswhilst our previous understanding of how covid-19 affects the heart was limited to case reports and case series79 consistent epidemiological data have demonstrated that patients with established cardiovascular disease risk factors or elevated cardiac biomarkers have an increased susceptibility to infection and an increased risk of severe disease and death36 severe cardiac disease was observed in 1 in 7 patients across the whole cohort and in 1 in 8 patients without pre-existing cardiac disease this proportion rose to 1 in 5 when the indication for imaging included raised cardiac biomarkers the proportion of abnormal echocardiograms and those demonstrating severe cardiac disease were similar after excluding patients with previously established cardiac disease heart failure valve disease or ischaemic heart disease suggesting that in this population the cardiac abnormalities relate to covid-19 infectionthe pattern of cardiac injury observed in our survey appears to be consistent with the cardiovascular involvement observed in patients with other severe viral respiratory infections1619 right ventricular abnormalities were observed in a quarter of patients and were more common in patients with more severe symptoms of covid-19 these are likely to reflect severe respiratory disease including the viral pneumonia itself as well as both clinical and subclinical pulmonary thrombo-embolism20 left ventricular abnormalities were present in a third of patients and were predominantly non-specific in nature further research is required to define the mechanism of this dysfunction as only occasionally were echocardiographic patterns consistent with myocardial infarction myocarditis or takotsubo cardiomyopathy the latter conditions are often difficult to recognize during an isolated echocardiogram particularly when performed in a critical care setting and as such their true prevalence may have been underestimatedin a third of patients who underwent echocardiography on clinical indication imaging was reported to result in an immediate change in patient management this included changes in disease-specific therapies such as pericardiocentesis or therapy for heart failure pulmonary embolism or acute coronary syndromes it also contributed to decisions regarding the level of patient care such as the admission of patients to critical care and the need for titration of haemodynamic support in practice this proportion may have been underestimated as echocardiographers may not have fully appreciated the consequences of their scan at the time of imaging in addition a majority of patients had echocardiography performed in an intensive care unit in this setting optimization of management may have been previously instituted or changes in management limited by severe respiratory or haemodynamic compromise few previous studies have reported the impact of echocardiography on changes in management and none has been performed in a critical care setting21 to put our findings into context bethge et al report in an outpatient setting that whilst 22 of patients had abnormal findings management changed in only 3 of patients22 finally we suggest that information supporting the continuation of a management strategy may be as clinically relevant as information that leads to the initiation of an alternative strategythe complex logistics involved in performing echocardiography in patients with covid-19 and the risk of virus transmission necessitates robust selection of patients for imaging23 our data do not imply that all patients with covid-19 require an echocardiogram indeed patients undergoing echocardiography here had clearly defined clinical indications our data suggest that cardiac biomarkers may help improve the selection of patients for imaging with elevated bnp and cardiac troponin concentrations independent predictors of left and right ventricular abnormalities respectively building on this study there is now a need for future imaging and biomarker studies to systematically investigate the cardiovascular manifestations of covid-19 and to establish their true prevalence the capacity-covid european registry aims to determine the role of cardiovascular disease in the covid-19 pandemic through standardized large-scale data collection24 imaging with echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance following recovery from covid-19 will be more readily achievable and will be well placed to define any residual cardiac damage caused by the condition similarly studies investigating whether cardiac biomarkers can better direct clinical imaging and improve patient outcomes would be welcomeour study suffers from the usual limitations associated with an observational survey whilst by design we sought to conduct a rapid survey capturing key echocardiographic findings during the pandemics peak this limited the amount and granularity of the data we could capture we are reliant on operator-reported findings as is common in clinical practice and acknowledge that definitive assessment and core lab verification of cardiac function with echocardiography in critically ill patients is challenging a proportion of the data was collected from free text-fields and as such may be biased and represent an underestimate of these findings or clinical variables additionally this survey is subject to substantial case selection bias for example we do not know the prevalence of abnormalities in those who did not undergo scanning in view of the complex logistics around scanning echocardiography was probably limited to those with clear clinical indications or those with increased disease severity furthermore the use of echocardiography has probably decreased in the current pandemic due to concerns over viral transmission and this may further contribute to the selection of patients for scanning we did not capture patient outcomes but many of the relevant outcomes have yet to occur finally there were relatively few data from certain countries including china as the survey continues we will seek to better target and gather more information from these countries with further reports to followin this global survey cardiac abnormalities were observed in half of all covid-19 patients undergoing echocardiography abnormalities were often unheralded or severe and imaging changed management in one-third of patientscoronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 is an emerging infectious disease that has been
declared a global public health emergency by the world health organization who
since its inception in wuhan china over 3500000 cases and 243403 deaths have
been recorded worldwide1 although the majority of patients with covid-19 have a mild influenza-like

pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards multi-organ failure and can

indication of small-study effects in the association between pct
p  0003 crp p  0001 and a
composite poor outcomean elevated serum crp pct d-dimer and ferritin can be used as laboratory
biomarkers for a poor outcome in covid-19 the cutoff points of elevated crp
10 mgl pct 05 ngml and d-dimer 05 mgl are suggested based on
the current evidence even though higher cutoff values might reflect a poorer
outcome serum crp may not only be used as a prognostic marker but also to
monitor disease improvement in covid-19 elevated serum pct might be useful in
guiding antibiotic therapy for bacterial superinfection although further
studies are warranted based on our findings on the association between serum
d-dimer levels and a poor outcome in covid-19 we support the current isth
guideline on the use of a prophylactic anticoagulant in patients with covid-1952 we also encourage further studies to create a prognostic model that
includes these biomarkers along with other proven poor prognostic factors in
covid-1965657the limitations of this systematic review and meta-analysis were the possible
presence of publication bias the use of non-peer-reviewed studies and the
nature of retrospective studies the asymmetrical inverted funnel-plot for serum
d-dimer pct crp and ferritin implied the presence of publication bias we
included studies published on preprints servers and which were not yet
peer-reviewed this was due to the emergent pandemic situation of covid-19
during which data from preprints servers might be crucial despite the
drawbacks most of the studies were from a single country thus the patients
might overlap across reports all the included studies were mostly retrospective
and observational therefore the results must be cautiously interpretedthis meta-analysis showed that an elevated serum crp pct d-dimer and serum
ferritin were associated with a composite poor outcome in patients with
covid-19coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic has drastically affected the global health and as of 15th may 2020 resulted in 4248389 million confirmed cases and a death toll of 294046 worldwide 1this disease has presented with a heterogeneous clinical course ranging from asymptomatic carrier state to a lethal outcome with multi-organ failure and with a wide variety of case fatality rates ranging from 07 to 67 24 although the respiratory tract is the most commonly involved organ system in this disease other organs and particularly the heart are also affected with a negative impact on outcome 5 furthermore pre-existing cardiovascular disease cvd can affect severity and mortality of these patients despite myriads of studies investigating cardiovascular diseases in patients with covid-19 there are still numerous unanswered questions most importantly a triage risk stratification tool trst that allows timely recognition of high-risk patients and well-timed delivery of risk-level-appropriate patient-tailored and pathophysiological-targeted treatment 6the aims of this systematic review and meta-analyses were 1 to calculate pooled frequency of newly developed and pre-existing cvd hypertension diabetes mellitus cardiac symptoms as the initial presentations of covid-19 elevation of cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers acute hepatic and renal injury 2 to investigate association of newly developed and pre-existing cvd including any acquired cardiac disease encompassing ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies or congenital heart disease hypertension and elevated cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers with severity of the disease and mortality 3 to define the clinical spectrum and mechanisms of the newly developed cardiovascular diseases in the pediatric and adult population the spectrum of newly developed arrhythmias and electrocardiographic changes and the pathologic findings of cardiac autopsies and 4 to propose a trst for timely detection and appropriate pathophysiologically targeted treatment of high-risk covid-19 patients with associated cvdwe conducted an online search in databases of pubmed and embase on 21st april 2020 to identify relevant studies the search terms included covid-19 and cardiovascular diseases and other relevant or equivalent terms we provided our search strategy in supplementary material 1 s1 to retrieve additional eligible studies we also traced the reference list of the retrieved papers and relevant reviewsstudies were included if 1 they had reported associated cardiovascular diseases in covid-19 patients 2 assessed levels of cardiac biomarkers in covid-19 patients and 3 were original peer-reviewed studies except for one study that we used in our qualitative analysis and was retrieved from medrxiv 7 we did not apply any limitation on language or publication date studies were included in our quantitative analysis if they had a sample size of equal to or larger than ten the rest of the articles including case reports case series and studies investigating pathological features of the heart tissue were assessed in the qualitative analysis we excluded review articlesdata selection was in concordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelines 1 two authors sm and ps independently assessed the eligibility of the retrieved

factor-alpha tnf- and 4 frequency of acute hepatic injury and acute kidney damageto critically appraise the included studies we implemented the newcastleottawa scale nos 8 the possible scores of this scale range from 0 to 9 studies with a score of seven to nine four to six and zero to three were classified as studies with low moderate and high risk of bias respectivelywe used openmeta analyst 9 version 11514 and revman version 53 10 using forest plots we illustrated the results of the analyses we used funnel plots to illustrate the publication bias the odds ratio or were calculated to compare frequencies of acute cardiac injury hypertension and pre-existing cardiovascular diseases between the deceased and the recovered patients and also between patients with severe and non-severe manifestations we used standardized mean difference smd to compare levels of cardiac troponin ck nt-pro bnp myoglobin ldh crp esr ferritin il-6 and ldh between the deceased and recovered patients and levels of crp ldh ck and ck-mb between the severe and non-severe caseswe used the i2 index to assess heterogeneity between studies the i2-indices of 025 2675 and 75100 represented low moderate and high degrees of heterogeneity respectively 11 we utilized fixed effects models if the results were homogeneous i  50 and p  005 and random effect models if these results were heterogeneous i  50 or p  005 12to convert median and inter-quartile range iqr to mean and standard deviation sd we used statistical methods suggested by luo et al 13 and wan et al 14 for one study which did not report the first and third quartiles of its data we assumed the mean equal to the median and the standard deviation sd equal to iqr divided by 2 6our analysis of the comparison of patients with severe to those with non-severe covid-19 included two types of categorization namely icu versus non-icu groups and severe defined as respiratory rate  30 timesmin oxygen saturation at resting state  93 partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio  300 versus non-severe presented as without pneumonia or with mild pneumonia categories we also calculated the overall effect of each parameter on both groups severe or icu group and non-severe or non-icu group as a whole in the series of studies with icu versus non-icu groups we did not include the study performed by du et al 15 since they had clearly stated that all of their patients had an indication for icu admission but they could not admit them into icu just because of a shortage of resources regarding study of han et al in which they had classified their patients into three subgroups as mild severe and critical we merged the severe and critical groups additionally we did not include wan et als 16 study in our subgroup analysis comparing acute cardiac injury in patients with severe and non-severe disease because their definition of acute cardiac injury was not precisely definedin the pooled frequency analysis of patients with higher levels of crp esr ferritin il-6 nt-pro bnp d-dimer ldh cardiac troponins myoglobin ck and ck-mb we only included the studies which had indicated the number of patients with elevated levels of these biomarkers based on their laboratory cut-off valuesfigure 1 depicts the detailed process of data selection three-hundred and sixty-two 362 studies were retrieved in our initial search of pubmed and embase 315 of which remained after removing duplicates in titleabstract screening 257 papers did not meet our inclusion criteria and were excluded five of the studies entering full-text screening had either wrong study design or study population and were excluded we also added one pre-print study regarding cardiac pathological findings from medrvix 7 we included a total of 54 studies in our qualitative synthesis 35 of which were contained in our meta-analysis 3 1547
of the 54 selected studies for the review 19 records were case reports case series or pathological reports among studies included in our meta-analysis nine did not categorize their samples into subgroups and the rest had a subgroup classification tables 1 and 2 in the supplementary materials 2 and 3 s2 and s3 five studies grouped their patients based on whether they survived or not three depending on whether they had myocardial injury or high levels of cardiac biomarkers troponin t or nt-pro bnp four according to whether patients needed icu admission or not and eight had divided their patients based on the severity of manifestations three studies used a combination of these classifications and divided their patients into four or more subgroups moreover in three remaining studies age the time elapsed from the onset of symptom or requirement of supplemental oxygen were used to stratify patients
of the 35 studies we evaluated in the risk of bias assessment 30 studies had a low risk of bias while five records had a moderate risk of bias none of the included studies were assessed as a study with a high risk of bias the table of risk of bias assessment is available in supplementary material 4 s4acute cardiac injury with an estimated pooled frequency of 253 95 ci 195311 was the most commonly reported cardiac complication of covid-19 although the pooled estimated frequency of arrhythmia was slightly higher than acute cardiac injury 261 it was only reported in four studies and the 95 confidence interval ci was equal to 25515 notably there was significant heterogeneity in the estimates of newly developed acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia i2  93 moreover two studies with a total number of 367 patients had assessed newly developed heart failure due to covid-19 infection and the pooled frequency was calculated at 237 ci 193280among the cardiac manifestations as the initial presentation of covid-19 frequency of chest pain or chest tightness and palpitation were investigated a total of six studies had reported chest pain or chest tightness in covid-19 patients our pooled frequency analysis showed that this presentation was observed as an initial manifestation in approximately one-fifth 218 95 ci 19328 of patients additionally two other studies had reported palpitation as the initial presentation the estimated pooled frequency of which equaled to 91 95 ci 62121hypertension was the most common pre-existing comorbidity among covid-19 patients with a pooled frequency of 292 95 ci 247336 followed by diabetes with a pooled frequency of 135 95 ci 115154 overall fewer than one-fifth of patients had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases the pooled frequency of cardiovascular diseases was estimated at 126 95 ci 100152 additionally our analysis on the pooled frequency of heart failure using data of five studies which had reported pre-existing heart failure showed a pooled frequency of 63 95 ci 2998 there was significant heterogeneity in the estimates of pre-existing cardiovascular diseases and hypertension i2  95figure 2 illustrates the pooled frequency of elevation of cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers among the biomarkers we investigated esr and crp were the most commonly elevated biomarkers the estimated pooled frequencies of patients with elevated esr and crp were 718 95 ci 590846 and 754 95 ci 6684 similarly higher levels of serum ferritin was observed in approximately 703 95 ci 611642 of the patients elevation of il-6 was present in about two-thirds of patients 659 95 ci 552 765
moreover among cardiac biomarkers increased levels of nt-pro bnp d-dimer and ldh were found in approximately 40 of patients the estimated pooled frequencies of elevation of nt-pro bnp d-dimer and ldh were equal to 465 95 ci 289642 415 95 ci 310521 and 410 95 ci 288532 respectively elevation of cardiac troponins was observed in approximately one-quarter of patients 253 95 ci 176331 additionally we identified and analyzed the findings of five studies that had investigated the number of patients with increased myoglobin levels the estimated pooled frequency of elevated myoglobin was at near 191 95 ci 116266 lastly we found ten studies reporting the number of patients with elevated ck levels and two studies reporting the number of patients with elevated ck-mb levels the estimated pooled frequency of elevation of ck and ck-mb were equaled to 159 95 ci 105213 and 662 95 ci 691256 respectively of note chen et al reported reduction of ck levels in 23 of their patients 18 as the wide ci range and high heterogeneity score i2  99 show the results of this analysis cannot be very reliable and additional original investigations are required in this regard notably there was significant heterogeneity in the estimates of the frequency of increased cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers 86    i2  99only two studies had measured the levels of tnf- pooled frequency of elevated levels of tnf- was 583 95 ci 538627 19 33figure 3 depicts the odds ratio for death and developing severe forms of covid-19 infection according to the presence of newly developed acute cardiac injury hypertension diabetes mellitus and pre-existing cardiovascular diseases the forest plots showing the odds ratio for death according to newly developed acute cardiac injury pre-existing cardiovascular disease hypertension and diabetes mellitus are available in supplementary material 6 s6

given the cardio-hepatic and cardio-renal interactions we also analyzed the pooled frequency of acute liver injury and acute kidney injury in our selected studies 4852while acute cardiac injury was reported in 253 95 ci 195311 of patients acute liver injury was reported in 222 95 ci 135310 and acute kidney injury was stated in 88 of studies 95 ci 54122funnel plots showing publication bias of studies are shown in supplementary material 7 s7a diverse range of cardiovascular disease has been reported in patients with covid-19 which encompasses acute myocarditis including acute lymphocytic myocarditis 53 fulminant myocarditis 15 24 37 5456 acute myocardial infarction type 2 7 acute myopericarditis 46 acute pulmonary embolism 5760 cardiac tamponade 46 cardiogenic shock 61 62 cardiomyopathy 63 heart failure pericardial effusion pulmonary hypertension reverse takotsubo cardiomyopathy 64 and right ventricular dysfunction 62 65left ventricular failure was more commonly reported in covid-19 patients than right ventricular dysfunction however to date the majority of cases with right ventricular failure were secondary to acute pulmonary embolism 65 66 nevertheless fried and his colleagues reported myopericarditis in a 64-year-old patient who developed biventricular failure and was successfully managed using an intra-aortic balloon pump iabp 62in the pediatric population there was a case of mild elevation of troponin i in a 55-day-infant with excellent outcome and discharge from the hospital 67 however both kawasaki-like disease and kawasaki shock-like syndrome have been reported with covid-19 jones et al reported a 6-month-old female infant with the typical symptoms of kawasaki disease that was tested positive for covid-19 her echocardiogram was normal 68 riphagen and her colleagues reported 8 patients with shock aged 4 to 14 years who had initially presented with persistent fever rash inflammation of the conjunctiva peripheral edema and pain in the extremities all except one had prominent gastrointestinal symptoms and all except one weighed above 75th percentile all had elevated levels of cardiac troponins and developed warm shock none of them tested positive for covid-19 however a 14-year-old boy with 95 kg weight and a bmi of 33kgm2 who underwent ecmo and died of cerebral infarction was tested positive postmortem and another case was positive for covid-19 after discharge antibody test was positive for covid-19 in all the eight patients their echocardiographic findings included left ventricular andor right ventricular dysfunction and increased brightness of walls of the coronary arteries the authors suggested that covid-19 can produce a hyper-inflammation syndrome that involves multiple organs mimicking kawasaki disease shock syndrome 69the exact mechanisms of cardiac injury in patients with covid-19 are not confirmed however it is speculated that cardiac injury can occur through one or more of the putative mechanisms 28 70 71 direct invasion by the virus indirect damage due to the systemic inflammatory syndrome and cytokine storm dysregulation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system hypoxia-induced cardiac injury microvasculature damage of the heart stress-induced cardiomyopathy and cardiac damage secondary to multi-organ failuretiming of the appearance of the cardiac complications early versus late stage may serve as a hint to the diagnosis of the putative mechanisms 72 73dynamic changes in ecg are of paramount importance during covid-19 and imply acute cardiac derangement patients with covid-19 are at risk of arrhythmias and ecg changes due to the disease itself or because of the medications used for its prevention or treatment such as chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin these three medications can prolong qt interval and predispose the patient to torsades de pointes 74 nevertheless to date no case of torsades de pointes due to qtc prolongation secondary to consumption of these drugs has been reported in these patientssinus tachycardia is the most common rhythm disturbance reported in patients with covid-19 moreover a variety of other rhythm disorders and electrocardiographic alterations have been reported in patients with covid-19 such as supraventricular tachycardia 62 63 ventricular tachycardia first-degree atrioventricular block avb temporary second-degree avb reversible complete heart block generalized st-elevation masquerading st-elevation myocardial infarction stemi triangular-type st-elevation myocardial infarction type 2 s1q3t3 pattern mimicking acute pulmonary embolism non-specific st and t wave changes diffuse u waves in the presence of a qtc of 045 ms and pulseless electrical activity 63 75by 23rd of april 2020 there are seven studies reporting the cardiac pathological findings 7 61 64 7679 the summary of these studies is tabulated in supplementary table 3 in supplementary material 8 s8 two of these have also performed electron microscopic examination 61 79 only in one case with fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock virus was present in the pericytes 61 no obstruction or thrombosis of epicardial coronary arteries were reported prominent infiltration of t lymphocytes was present in only one case which presented as reverse takutsubo cardiomyopathy 53time of presentation of the cardiac disorders early stage versus late stage and levels of various cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers can serve as clues to the putative underlying mechanisms to detect patients at the highest risk at the earliest ie at triage a simple and practical plan is necessary to guide the clinician on the minimal essential initial laboratory work-up as a guide for pathophysiologically targeted treatmentfigure 8 shows a proposed triage risk stratification tool for patients with covid-19 and cvd
two considerations should be taken into account when using this tool the first is that the laboratory investigations in this tool are in addition to the routine laboratory evaluations such as cbc esr crp and blood glucose secondly it should be borne in mind that for consideration of mechanical circulatory support the conventional indications and contraindications in patients with covid-19 in addition to the precautions for prevention and treatment of infections should be strictly followed 109111this study showed that pre-existing and newly developed cardiovascular disease are common in patients with covid-19 and are associated with increased severity and mortality in these patients the frequency clinical pattern severity and outcome of cardiovascular injury in pediatric patients with covid-19 is not only different from the adult population but also varies in the pediatric age range ranging from no cardiac damage in the majority of cases to kawasaki shock-like syndrome in the minority we proposed a triage risk stratification tool in patients with covid-19 and cvd for timely recognition of the high-risk patients and well-timed establishment of the pathophysiologically targeted treatment this tool needs to be validated in future studieslastly covid-19 should be regarded as a disease that can affect multiple organs with multiple mechanisms each of which may need therapy targeted at the mechanism of injury in order to be effectivethere were significant inconsistencies in reporting cardiovascular derangements in patients with covid-19 consistent terminology and definition of cardiac injury were not used in the studies furthermore the i2 index was high in some meta-analyses certain studies had done intensive evaluation and had presented immense information whereas there was a dearth of information regarding the patients in others these limitations indicate the necessity of a standardized terminology to report cardiovascular complications and a standard diagnostic approach to patients with covid-19 worldwide we did not include cardiac arrest in our analysis because the precise underlying pathophysiology of dying process end-stage respiratory failure cardiogenic shock multiple organ failure or cardiogenic shock was not delineated in the majority of studies 112 we could not include obesity in our study because data in this regard was not provided in the majority of studies another limitation of this study was that we did not search cochrane cinahl web of science scopus and google scholar database in our online search 113 lastly the limitations due to the possible inherent biases in the non-randomized cohort data apply to this study
