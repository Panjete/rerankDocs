cryo-em structures of hku2 and sads-cov spike glycoproteins provide insights into coronavirus evolution jinfang yu shuyuan qiao runyu guo xinquan wang   coronaviruses categorized into the order nidovirales family coronaviridae and subfamily coronavirinae are a large group of viral pathogens with a wide host range1 their infections in humans other mammals and birds can cause respiratory hepatic enteric and neurological diseases with varying severity2 the zoonotic transmission of novel coronaviruses into humans poses severe threats to the global health evidenced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and the sars-cov-2 that is causing the ongoing pandemic covid-19 in the world136 in the meantime coronaviruses infecting domestic animals also bring substantial economic losses7 for example the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov also known as seacov and peav isolated in 2017 caused outbreaks of severe watery diarrhea of suckling piglets with a mortality up to 90 in several commercial pig farms in guangdong province of china813 sads-cov is an -coronavirus and other representative members in the -genus are porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv and human nl63 and 229e coronaviruses hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e1 representative members in other three genera include mouse hepatitis coronavirus mhv bovine coronavirus bcov sars-cov sars-cov-2 mers-cov hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 in the -genus avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv in the -genus and porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov in the -genus1 cross-species transmission promoted by genetic recombination andor mutations underlies the host range expansion of coronaviruses31416 bats are the natural reservoir of more than 30 different - and -coronaviruses that have great potential for interspecies transmission by recombination andor mutation151719 data on genetic evolution receptor binding and pathogenesis have demonstrated that human sars-cov and mers-cov most likely originate from bats1 palm civets and dromedary camels are the intermediate hosts of sars-cov and mers-cov from bats to humans respectively1 the newly identified porcine sads-cov isolates are also found to share 95 sequence identity with rhinolophus bat coronavirus hku2 and this further stressed the severe results of coronavirus spillover from bats to domestic animals813 however the molecular mechanisms underlying the transmission of sads-cov from bats to pigs are still unknown and need to be further explored recently it was shown that sads-cov is able to infect cells from a broad range of species including mouse chicken pig monkey and human indicating a high potential of the sads-cov for interspecies transmission20 the spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses mediates viral entry by binding host receptor with the s1 subunit and fusing viral and cellular membranes with the s2 subunit thereby determining viral host range and tissue tropism2122 as a class i viral fusion protein the spike exists on the envelope of virion as a homotrimer and each monomer contains more than 1000 amino acid residues that can be cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits21 for most coronaviruses the n-terminal domain ntd of the s1 subunit recognizes cell-surface carbohydrates while the c-terminal domain ctd specifically binds to cellular protein receptors2123 sars-cov sars-cov-2 and hcov-nl63 utilize ctd to bind human receptor ace22430 mers-cov utilizes ctd to bind human receptor dpp43132 and tgev prcv and 229e utilize ctd to bind receptor apn3335 hcov-oc43 utilizes ntd to recognize glycans36 and one exception is mhv which utilizes the ntd to bind mouse receptor ceacam1a3738 therefore the s1 subunit especially its ntd and ctd is the most variable region of the spike and is responsible for different tropisms of coronaviruses in comparison the s2 subunit containing the fusion peptide fp and heptad repeats hr1 and hr2 for membrane fusion are more conserved in both sequence and structure2122 for the sads-cov receptor analysis indicated that none of the known coronavirus protein receptors including ace2 dpp4 and apn are essential for cell entry1020 there are also no reports regarding the recognition of glycans by the ntd of sads-cov structural studies of the spike and its binding with glycans and protein receptors have provided important insights into the origin evolution and interspecies transmission of coronaviruses cryo-em structures of spike trimer from all four coronavirus genera have been reported the -coronavirus spike structures are determined for hcov-nl6339 hcov-229e34 pedv40 and fipv41 the -coronavirus spike structures are determined for mhv384243 hcov-hku144 hcov-oc4336 sars-cov244547 mers-cov454849 and sars-cov-25051 and the -coronavirus spike structure is determined for ibv52 and the -coronavirus spike structure is determined for pdcov5354 the cryo-em structures of bat coronavirus spike trimers have not been reported and only crystal structures of the ctd from hku455 hku556 and hku957 were determined the spikes of sads-cov 1130 amino acid residues and hku2 1128 amino acid residues are among the shortest coronavirus spike glycoproteins58 and their amino acid identities to other known coronavirus spikes are lower than 28 indicating the spikes of hku2 and sads-cov are unique81359 in this study we report the cryo-em structures of the sads-cov and hku2 spike trimers at 283 and 238  resolution respectively the hku2 spike trimer structure is the first one from bat coronavirus we analyze the hku2 and sads-cov trimer structures and also compare the ntd ctd sd1 and sd2 domains of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunit of hku2 with other spikes from - - - and -coronaviruses our results strongly support that hku2 and sads-cov preserve primitive structural features in their spikes that have a close evolutionary relationship with -coronavirus spikes and provide insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses the cdnas encoding hku2 spike yp001552236 and sads-cov spike avm415691 were synthesized with codons optimized for insect cell expression hku2 ectodomains residues 11066 and sads-cov ectodomains residues 11068 were separately cloned into pfastbac-dual vector invitrogen with c-terminal foldon tag and strep tag after expression in hi5 insect cells and purification to homogeneity the cryo-em images on these two spike ectodomains were recorded using fei titan krios microscope operating at 300 kv with a gatan k2 summit direct electron detector supplementary fig 1 about 1400000 particles for hku2 spike and 900000 particles for sads-cov spike were subjected to 2d classification and a total of 421490 particles of hku2 spike and 152334 particles of sads-cov spike were selected and subjected to 3d refinement with c3 symmetry to generate density maps supplementary fig 2 the overall density maps were solved to 238  for hku2 spike and 283  for sads-cov spike gold-standard fourier shell correlation fsc  0143 supplementary figs 13 the atomic-resolution density map enabled us to build nearly all residues of hku2 spike ectodomains residues 17995 except for a few breaks residues 129141 and 203205 as well as 48 n-linked glycans and 71 water molecules supplementary figs 3a 4a and 5a the final refined model of sads-cov spike contains residues 19998 with some short breaks residues 8283 134143 and 488490 and 45 n-linked glycans supplementary figs 3b 4b and 5b data collection and refinement statistics for these two structures are listed in table 1 the overall structures of hku2 and sads-cov spikes we determined here resemble the previously reported prefusion structures of coronaviruses spikes both spike trimers have a mushroom-like shape 150  in height and 115  in width fig 1a consisting of a cap mainly formed by -sheets of the s1 subunit a central stalk mainly formed by -helices of the s2 subunit and a root formed by twisted -sheets and loops of the s2 subunit fig 1a in each trimer there is a c3 axis along the central stalk fig 1a the amino acid identity between hku2 and sads-cov spikes is 86 and these two spike structures are quite similar with the root mean square deviation rmsd being 053  for 962 aligned c atoms of the monomer and 056  for 2886 aligned c atoms of the trimer due to the high structural similarity we will use the hku2 structure to present the features of both spikes in the subsequent description whereas significant differences between them will be pointed out only when necessary the s1 subunit of the hku2 spike comprises two major domains ntd and ctd which are followed by two subdomains 1 and 2 sd1 and sd2 connecting them to the s2 subunit fig 1b c the s1 subunits from three monomers form the cap of the spike in which the three ctds in the inner part are at the apex sitting on top of the central stalk and the three ntds are located outside the ctds surrounding the central stalk fig 1a the ntd ctd sd1 and sd2 of the s1 subunit are all mainly composed of  strands fig 1c in contrast the upstream helix uh fp connecting region cr heptad repeat 1 hr1 and central helix ch of the s2 subunit are mainly composed of helices whereas the -hairpin bh and subdomain 3 sd3 at the bottom part of the s2 subunit mainly consist of  strands and loops fig 1c moreover the residues after the sd3 which contain the heptad repeat 2 hr2 are not resolved in the hku2 and sads-cov spike structures as well as in all other reported coronavirus spike structures in the prefusion state the sd1 and sd2 of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunit are highly similar in amino acid sequence 85 84 and 95 identities and structure c rmsd less than 05  between hku2 and sads-cov spikes supplementary fig 6 the ntd has the lowest sequence identity of 70 among all domains structural superimposition also gave a higher c rmsd value of 12  between these two ntds the core -sheet structure is structurally conserved and conformational variations reside in the loops supplementary fig 6a the ctd sequence identity between hku2 and sads-cov spikes is 82 and the c rmsd between these two ctds is 11  also indicating more structural variations in the ctd in comparison with the highly conserved sd1 sd2 and s2 subunit the ntd and ctd of the s1 subunit are commonly utilized by coronaviruses for binding cell-surface carbohydrates or protein receptors for cell attachment23 therefore the sequence andor structural variations indicate that hku2 and sads-cov would also bind different host receptors by ntd andor ctd of the s1 subunit although their receptors in bat and pig are unknown and the receptor-binding sites on spike have not been defined the ntd of hku2 has three layers of antiparallel -sheet with the top one consisting of six strands the middle one consisting of five strands and the bottom one consisting of three strands below the bottom sheet is a short -helix fig 2a the top and middle -sheets form a galectin-like -sandwich fold which is inserted between two strands of the bottom sheet fig 2a to supplement three disulfide bonds are detected in the hku2 ntd structure c17c56 connecting the n-terminus of the ntd to its upper loop c124c149 connecting 6 and 7 strands in the top sheet and c234c244 connecting the bottom helix to the bottom sheet fig 2a although the ntds of all coronaviruses adopt a similar overall architecture the ntd of hku2 has the highest structural similarity with the ntd1 named domain 0 in previous reports of -coronavirus hcov-nl63 with an rmsd of 27  for 186 aligned c atoms fig 2b and supplementary fig 8d the ntd1 of -coronavirus pedv is not completely modeled in the spike trimer structure however the partial model still fits well with the ntd of hku2 with an rmsd of 23  for 73 aligned c atoms both hcov-nl63 and pedv have a second ntd ntd2 also named domain a in previous reports and the ntd of hku2 is structurally less similar to the ntd2 with an rmsd of 43  against hcov-nl63 ntd2 and of 41  against pedv ntd2 fig 2b and supplementary fig 8d recent structural determination showed that another -coronavirus hcov-229e also has one ntd which is more structurally similar to the ntd2 c rmsd of 20  than the ntd1 c rmsd of 37  of hcov-nl63 fig 2c all above comparisons indicate that there are two subtypes of ntd in the -coronaviruses the subtype i is represented by the ntds of hku2 sads-cov the ntd1s of hcov-nl63 and pedv and the subtype ii is represented by the ntd of hcov-229e the ntd2s of hcov-nl63 and pedv fig 2b c although sharing an overall architecture these two ntd subtypes have a structural difference in the galectin-like -sandwich fold containing the top and middle sheets stacked together through hydrophobic interactions these two -sheets are well aligned in the galectin-like domain of subtype i whereas there is an alignment shift in the galectin-like domain of subtype ii fig 2b the other notable difference is the distribution of signature disulfide bonds a signature disulfide bond c124c149 numbered in hku2 and connecting 6 and 7 strands in the top sheet is conserved in all subtype i ntds fig 2b and the subtype ii ntds have two signature disulfide bonds the first one c145c168 numbered in hcov-229e connecting 5 and 6 strands and the second one c81c105 numbered in hcov-229e connecting 2 and neighbor loop fig 2c besides c234c244 numbered in hku2 and connecting the bottom helix to the bottom sheet is conserved in both subtype i and subtype ii ntds fig 2b c the ntds of -coronaviruses including bcov hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 mers-cov sars-cov and mhv resemble the subtype i rather than the subtype ii ntd in the topology and distribution of the disulfide bonds fig 2d these -coronavirus ntds have additional loops in the n-terminus between 1 and 2 strands and between 6 and 7 strands numbered in hku2 structure forming an extensive ceiling-like structure on top of the galectin-like fold fig 2d it has been found that the evolvement of this ceiling-like structure has functional outcomes such as immune evasion or receptor binding52 the ntd of -coronavirus ibv also resemble the subtype i ntd in the topology although its disulfide bond positions are not conserved as in the subtype i ntd fig 2e of note the ntd of -coronavirus pdcov resemble the subtype ii ntd in the topology and distribution of the disulfide bonds fig 2f both ibv and pdcov ntds also have additional insertions including loops and short helices in the galectin-like fold compared with the two subtypes of ntd in -coronaviruses fig 2e f the ctd of hku2 has a twisted five-stranded antiparallel -sheet as the core with connecting loops between the strands fig 3a it contains four disulfide bonds c277c300 and c285c290 at the n-terminus c341c397 at the c-terminus and the last one c331c369 connecting the 2 and 5 strands in the core -sheet fig 3a interestingly the ctd core of hku2 is of high structural similarity with the conserved ctd core of -coronaviruses and the disulfide bonds in the ctd of hku2 except for c285c290 are also detected in all -coronavirus ctds fig 3b these ctds have the core of one twisted -sheet and here we name them as one-layer ctd subtype fig 3a b the -coronavirus ctds always have an insertion consisting of loops andor strands between the 5 and 6 strands of the core fig 3b sars-cov26 sars-cov-22730 mers-cov3132 hku455 and hku556 have receptor-binding motif rbm in this insertion region responsible for binding their respective protein receptors in the ctd of hku2 there is only one short loop between the 5 and 6 strands of the core twisted -sheet fig 3a although as members in the -genus hku2 and sads-cov ctd structures are significantly different from those of other -coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-229e pedv tgev and prcv that contain two layers of -sheets fig 3c and we named these ctds as two-layer ctd subtype all available two-layer ctd structures can be well aligned with c rmsd in the range of 1034  these two-layer ctds contain two highly conserved disulfide bonds c540c586 and c569c596 numbered in pedv ctd fig 3c the c569c596 is conserved among all coronaviruses whereas the c540c586 is conserved in all -coronaviruses except for hku2 and sads and -coronavirus pdcov fig 3c the ctd of -coronavirus pdcov has a core of two -sheets belonging to the two-layer ctd subtype fig 3c as for the -coronavirus ibv the core of its ctd is also similar to the typical two-layer ctd fig 3c however several  strands are replaced by loops and the disulfide bonds are in different positions from the two-layer ctd fig 3c ibv ctd also has an extra region of loops reminiscent of the extra domain in the ctds of -coronaviruses fig 3c the sd1 and sd2 are two subdomains following the ctd in the s1 subunit linking the ctd to the s2 subunit the hku2 sd1 is a partial  barrel consisting of five  strands and a disulfide bond c409c458 connecting its c-terminus to the 1 strand fig 4a this five-stranded  barrel and the linking disulfide bond are conserved among all four genera of coronavirus fig 4a the hku2 sd2 has a structure of two layers of -sheet with an additional short -helix over the top sheet fig 4b the additional -helix and the top sheet is linked by a disulfide bond c482c509 and another disulfide bond c524c533 links the c-terminal loop to the bottom sheet fig 4b the two-layer core structure and the second disulfide bond are conserved among all genera of coronavirus however the additional -helix and the first linking disulfide bond is a distinct feature of -coronaviruses plus -coronavirus hku2 and sads-cov fig 4b this additional helix appears to be an insertion between the 2 and 3 strands of the sd2 and is retained during evolution of -coronaviruses it has been observed that coronaviruses have two types of quaternary packing mode of the s1 subunits in the trimer intrasubunit packing and cross-subunit packing52 actually this is mainly caused by different positioning and interaction between ntd and ctd in the spike monomer the hku2 s1 subunit similar to those in -coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-229e and pedv and -coronavirus pdcov has an inward ctd that contacts with the ntd fig 5a the three structural ntdctd modules in the cap region of these spikes are composed of ntd and ctd from the same monomer forming the intrasubunit packing in the spike trimer fig 5a the s1 subunits of other coronaviruses in the - and -genera including mhv sars-cov mers-cov hcov-oc43 and ibv have an outward ctd that is far away from the ntd fig 5b therefore the three structural ntdctd modules in the cap region of these spikes have the ntd from one monomer and the ctd from the adjacent monomer forming the cross-subunit packing in the spike trimer fig 5b interestingly we found that the outward ctds always have an insertion in the core structure such as -coronavirus ctds and -coronavirus ibv ctd fig 5b in contrast all inward ctds only have the one-layer or two-layer core structure without obvious inserted region sequence analysis suggested that the s1s2 protease cleavage site at the boundary between the s1 and s2 subunits is r544-m545 in hku2 spike and r546-m547 in sads-cov spike81159 compared with the s1 subunit the topology and structure of s2 subunit are highly conserved in all coronavirus spikes the hku2 s2 subunit contains a 3-helix uh residues 589639 an fp helix residues 672684 a cr residues 689747 a 4-helix hr1 residues 748836 a ch residues 837887 a twisted bh residues 888929 and a -sandwich like sd3 residues 930995 figs 1b and 6a like in other coronavirus spikes in the prefusion state the model of hr2 after sd3 was not built in the structure due to poor density five disulfide bonds in s2 are detected two of them c590c612 and c595c601 stabilize the folded helices of uh c696c706 bends the cr c884c895 links the ch and the bh and c934c943 is within the sd3 fig 6a the first four disulfide bonds are conserved in all coronaviruses and the last one in the sd3 has different positions in different spikes specifically it links the 2 and 3 strands of sd3 in the spikes of hku2 sads-cov and mers-cov numbered in mers-cov and in other coronavirus spikes it links the 2 strand to the c-terminal loop of sd3 numbered in mers-cov supplementary fig 7 all coronavirus spikes have the s2 protease site upstream from the fp in the s2 subunit which is essential for proteolytic fusion activation of the spike receptor binding and cleavage at the s2 site promote large-scale conformational changes of the fp cr hr1 and hr2 allowing the insertion of fp into host cell membrane and the formation of six-helix bundle the fp and cr which are often not well and totally resolved in other coronavirus spike structures can be clearly modeled in the hku2 spike due to the atomic resolution of the map supplementary fig 5 the typical cr in the s2 subunit contains three helices and one short strand with a disulfide bond bending the first and second helix to form a turn fig 6b in hku2 the second helix is replaced by a short strand 713716 and the third helix is replaced by a loop 721741 therefore there are two short strands and only one helix in hku2 cr fig 6c the conserved disulfide bond c696c706 makes the first helix of cr in hku2 spike turn upside down the s2 cleavage site between r671 and s672 is then covered by the reversed cr helix and loops and r671 interacts with e723 in the loop and k697 and k698 in helix 1 fig 6c in other coronaviruses taking the mhv s2 for example the helix 1 does not cover the s2 site between r869 and s870 and r869 only loosely interacts with t929 in helix 3 fig 6b after the dissociation of the s1 subunit triggered by receptor binding the exposure of the s2 site for cleavage is a prerequisite for the proteolytic activation of the coronavirus spike to mediate membrane fusion the buried s2 site indicates that hku2 spike compared with other coronavirus spikes would require more conformational changes around the s2 site for the exposure a porcine coronavirus sads-cov also named seacov and peav in other reports was recently identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea in southern china and its genome sequence was most identical 95 identity to that of rhinolophus bat -coronavirus hku2813 the sads-cov and hku2 are phylogenetically located in a sublineage closely related to the proposed -coronavirus group-1b lineage at the complete genome level813 however phylogenetic analysis based on the spike glycoprotein indicated that they are members of a separate lineage clustered within -coronavirus supplementary fig 8a suggesting that hku2 and sads-cov probably resulted from recombination of an -coronavirus with an unrecognized -coronavirus s gene813 these results together with the lower than 28 amino acid identities to other known coronavirus glycoproteins strongly indicate that the spike glycoproteins of hku2 and sads-cov are unique813 in this study we determined the cryo-em structures of hku2 and sads-cov spike glycoproteins at atomic resolutions pairwise comparisons demonstrated nearly identical overall structures and differences mainly locate in the loops of ntd and ctd of the s1 subunit between the spikes of hku2 and sads-cov supplementary fig 6 a series of structural analysis and comparisons were also performed at the domain level between hku2 spike with other coronavirus spikes with determined structures our results show that hku2 and sads-cov spikes maintain primitive structural features especially in the ntd and ctd and provide more insights into the evolution of coronaviruses the hku2 and sads-cov have one ntd in the s1 subunit and their structures are more similar to the ntd1 than the ntd2 of -coronaviruses hcov-nl63 and pedv whereas the only ntd of hcov-229e is structurally more similar to the ntd2 than the ntd1 fig 2 therefore we suggest that -coronaviruses have two subtypes of ntd the evolution relationship between them are not clear yet it was once suggested that the presence of two ntds in hcov-nl63 is a result of gene duplication39 however the sequence identity between these two ntds is only 157 in hcov-nl63 and 129 in pedv considering that hku2 sads-cov and hcov-229e have one ntd belonging to either subtype i or subtype ii a more plausible evolution way of the ntd in -coronaviruses is the recombination of two separate primitive domains into the genome resulting in the presence of two ntds in the s1 subunit of -coronaviruses including hcov-nl63 and pedv of note these two ntd subtypes may represent primitive structures that could be the evolutionary ancestors of ntds of other genera coronaviruses for example in the current available spike structures the ntds of -coronavirus are similar to the hku2 ntd representing the subtype i in both architecture and disulfide bond positions these -coronavirus ntds also have additional loop ceiling over the top sheet functionally facilitating immune evasion or protein receptor binding such as in mhv3738 the ntd of -coronavirus ibv is also architecturally similar to the subtype i although the disulfide bond positions are not conserved fig 2e in contrast the -coronavirus pdcov ntd is similar to the hcov-229e ntd representing the subtype ii in both architecture and disulfide bond positions fig 2f a previous study of the ibv spike proposed that -coronavirus ntds are probably the most ancestral and the ntds of the four genera form an evolutionary spectrum in the order of - - - and -genus52 our proposal here is similar to the previous one in the point that two ntd subtypes in -coronaviruses may represent primitive structures that could be the evolutionary ancestors of ntds however we argue that the evolution pathways may not be in the order of - - - and -genus a more plausible pathway is that the - - and -coronavirus ntds may evolve independently and parallelly from subtype i - and -coronavirus ntds or subtype ii -coronavirus ntds supplementary fig 8b the hku2 and sads-cov ctd structure has a one-layer core consisting of a twisted five-stranded antiparallel -sheet interestingly -coronavirus ctds also have the similar one-layer core structure and three strictly conserved disulfide bonds are also present in the core of hku2 ctd currently all identified rbm of -coronavirus ctds are within an inserted domain between two strands of the core sheet and this insertion responsible for receptor binding of -coronaviruses is replaced by a short loop in hku2 ctd this result firstly indicates hku2 ctd represent a primitive structure in the one-layer ctd family while the inserted domain in -coronaviruses results from a recombinant event during evolution supplementary fig 8c the second indication is that hku2 and sads-cov may not utilize the ctd to bind protein receptors that have not been identified yet and their different receptor usage may be determined by the ntd that harbors almost 50 of residue difference between them of note the ctds from other -coronaviruses -coronavirus ibv and -coronavirus pdcov all belong to the two-layer subtype consisting of two layers -sheets although with structural variations in different viruses these results further confirmed the previous phylogenetic analysis suggesting that hku2 and sads-cov probably resulted from a recombination of an -coronavirus genomic backbone with an unrecognized -coronavirus spike gene81159 in contrast with the ntd and ctd having unique structural features the sd1 and sd2 of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunits of hku2 and sads-cov are structurally conserved as those of other coronaviruses in the evolutionary aspect it is not surprising because this region either connects the ctd to the s2 subunit sd1 and sd2 or mediates the membrane fusion s2 subunits whereas the ntd and ctd are key factors determining tissue tropism and host range of coronaviruses23 even highly conserved in overall structure the s2 subunit in hku2 and sads-cov still have a secondary structure arrangement in the cr after the fp resulting in a more buried s2 cleavage site fig 6c it indicates that although the membrane fusion mechanism is highly conserved the dynamic fusion procedures of hku2 and sads-cov may still have their unique features that need to be addressed in the future the ongoing covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 has raised worldwide alert46 we compared the domain structures of hku2 and sars-cov-2 s proteins supplementary fig 9 the ntd of sars-cov-2 has the two conserved disulfide bonds in subtype i the ctd core of sars-cov-2 has one layer of -sheets the sd1 and sd2 of sars-cov-2 have the same disulfide bonds with hku2 although the additional helix of sd2 is not built in the sars-cov-2 s model owing to poor density in this region sars-cov-2 has the typical -coronavirus structural features in each domain and the inserted rbm in the ctd could be the major impetus for cross-species transmission from bats to human in comparing the structures of hku2 and sads-cov spikes with other coronavirus spikes we observed that additional ntds could be recombined ceiling loops could be inserted into ntd core and extra domain containing rbm could be inserted into the ctd core structure these phenomena indicate the subdomains are gradually recruited into the s1 subunit during evolution and the recruitments are required for cross-species transmission adapting to different host range and responding to the updating of host immune system which provides a vivid example for the co-evolution of virus and host the cdnas encoding hku2 spike yp001552236 and sads-cov spike avm415691 were synthesized with codons optimized for insect cell expression hku2 ectodomains 11066 and sads-cov ectodomains 11068 were separately cloned into pfastbac-dual vector invitrogen with c-terminal foldon tag for trimerization and strep tag for purification in the frame of ph promoter they were expressed in hi5 insect cell using bac-to-bac baculovirus system invitrogen briefly the construct was transformed into dh10bac competent cells and the extracted bacmid was transfected into sf9 cell using cellfectin ii reagent invitrogen the baculoviruses were harvested after 79 days the high-titer viruses were generated after one more amplification that used to infect hi5 cells at a density of 15  106ml after 60 h in culture the cell medium containing spike ectodomains

superose 6 gel filtration column ge healthcare pre-equilibrated with hbs buffer 10 mm hepes ph 72 150 mm nacl purified ectodomains were concentrated for electron microscopy analysis aliquots of spike ectodomains 4 l 033 mgml in buffer containing 10 mm hepes ph 72 150 mm nacl were applied to glow-discharged holey carbon grids quantifoil grid au 300 mesh r1213 the grids were then blotted and then plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using fei vitrobot system fei images were recorded using fei titan krios microscope operating at 300 kv with a gatan k2 summit direct electron detector gatan inc at tsinghua university the automated software autoemation was used to collect 7663 movies for hku2 and 4568 movies for sads-cov at 130000 magnification and at a defocus range between 1 and 3 m each movie has a total accumulate exposure of 49784 e2 fractionated in 32 frames of 175 ms exposure data collection statistics are summarized in table 1 whole frames in each movie were corrected for beam-induced motion using motionco260 the final image was bin averaged to give a pixel size of 1061  the parameters of contrast transfer function ctf was estimated for each micrograph using gctf61 particles were

morbidity and mortality in cattle populations significantly reduce the income of cattle operations one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in cattle is diarrheal disease one study reported that of the total number of mortalities in calves less than 1 month of age in northern ireland in 1992 some 185 were due to gastrointestinal syndromes a figure that rose to 48 when stillbirths were excluded menzies et al 1996 cryptosporidium rotavirus coronavirus and escherichia coli are the major enteric pathogens in neonatal calves of 30 days or younger mcdonough et al 1994 bendali et al 1999 de la fuente et al 1999 naciri et al 1999 cattle are infected with at least four cryptosporidium species including cryptosporidium parvum cryptosporidium bovis cryptosporidium andersoni and the cryptosporidium deer-like genotype xiao et al 2004 a recent study in the united states has shown that the occurrence of these cryptosporidium spp in cattle is age-related santin et al 2004 c parvum is responsible for about 85 of the cryptosporidium infections in preweaned calves but only 1 of the cryptosporidium infections in postweaned calves postweaned calves and old cattle are mostly infected with c bovis c andersoni and the cryptosporidium deer-like genotype santin et al 2004 nevertheless c parvum is the major species responsible for diarrhea in calves and is the only zoonotic species in cattle recently researchers have used highly discriminatory subtyping techniques to study the transmission of bovine c parvum infections in a geographic area mallon et al 2003ab tanriverdi et al 2006 tanriverdi and widmer 2006 these tools are very useful in characterizing transmission dynamics of c parvum in cattle the maintenance of the parasite on cattle farms and the role of herd-to-herd transmission in epidemiology one of the most commonly used subtyping tools is based on sequence analysis of the 60-kda glycoprotein gene gp60 which differentiates c parvum to several subtype families and several subtypes within each family strong et al 2000 peng et al 2001 2003ab sulaiman et al 2001 2005 glaberman et al 2002 leav et al 2002 alves et al 2003 2006 sturbaum et al 2003 wu et al 2003 zhou et al 2003 chalmers et al 2005 abe et al 2006 trotz-williams et al 2006 of the two major c parvum subtype families the iia subtype family is zoonotic in nature and is seen in both humans and calves whereas the iic subtype family is anthroponotic and is only found in humans alves et al 2003 xiao and ryan 2004 currently little is known about the transmission of cryptosporidium spp in cattle in northern ireland a previous subtyping study of a small number of human specimens from outbreaks and sporadic cases identified several c parvum iia subtypes suggesting that these zoonotic subtypes might be present in cattle glaberman et al 2002 we report in this study a molecular epidemiologic study of cryptosporidiosis in neonatal calves in northern ireland fecal specimens submitted to the diagnostic laboratory at the veterinary sciences division of the department of agriculture and rural development for northern ireland stormont belfast were used in the study they were collected from symptomatic calves less than 1 month of age on farms across northern ireland over a 12-month period during march 2002 to february 2003 they were examined for the presence of cryptosporidium by a modified ziehlneelsen staining technique baxby et al 1984 rotavirus and coronavirus by enzymatic immunoassay using the pathasure enteritis elisa kit vetoquinol uk ltd bicester england and enteropathogenic e coli k99 by bacterial culture on a defined minimal medium minca agar guinee et al 1976 followed by the use of the latex agglutination test fimbrex k99 kit the veterinary laboratories agency addlestone surrey england genomic dna was extracted from cryptosporidium-positive specimens by alkaline digestion and phenolchloroform extraction followed by dna purification using the qiaamp dna stool mini kit qiagen valencia ca usa as previously described peng et al 2003b cryptosporidium spp presented were genotyped by nested polymerase chain reaction pcr and restriction fragment length polymorphism rflp analysis of an approximately 830-bp fragment of the small subunit ssu rrna gene xiao et al 2001 all secondary pcr products were sequenced to further confirm the genotype identification a fragment of the 60-kda glycoprotein gp60 gene of approximately 850 bp was amplified by nested pcr as previously described using 1 or 2 l of the extracted dna in primary pcr alves et al 2003 secondary pcr products were purified using the marligen rapid pcr purification kit marligen biosystems ijamsville md usa sequencing reactions for the purified products were performed using the abi bigdye terminator v31 cycle sequencing kit applied biosystems foster city ca usa following the manufacturers instructions ssu rrna pcr products were sequenced in both directions using the forward and reverse primer used in secondary pcr whereas gp60 products were mostly sequenced from the 5 end unincorporated fluorescent-dye terminators from the cycle-sequencing reaction were removed using autoseq g-50 columns amersham biosciences freiberg germany sequences were read on an abi3100 automated sequencer applied biosystems the nucleotide sequences obtained in this study were aligned with reference sequences retrieved from the genbank using the program clustalx ftpftp-igbmcu-strasbgfrpubclustalx the recently proposed nomenclature was used in naming c parvum subtypes sulaiman et al 2005 of the four common enteric pathogens in neonatal calves examined over 1 year period in this study cryptosporidium was the most prevalent being detected in 291 of 779 374 animals by microscopy of fecal smears stained by the modified ziehlneelsen staining technique rotavirus had a slightly lower prevalence rate being found in 242 of 806 300 specimens tested in contrast the prevalence rates of coronavirus 46806 or 57 of animals and e coli k9916421 or 38 of animals were much lower table 1 a total of 224 specimens positive for cryptosporidium by microscopy were available for molecular analysis among them 62 specimens 276 were concurrently positive for rotavirus six 27 for coronavirus and three 13 for e coli k99 

 
cryptosporidium infection was detected in calves in every month over the 1 year period there were considerable monthly variations in infection rates however infection rates during the summer months were generally lower than those in other months fig 1

 the 224 specimens positive for cryptosporidium by microscopy and available for molecular analysis were collected from neonatal calves on 193 farms across northern ireland dna extracted from them all yielded ssu rrna gene products of the expected size in nested pcr rflp analysis with sspi and vspi produced similar sspi banding patterns and identical vspi banding pattern for all pcr products the sspi rflp pattern of most pcr products was indicative of c parvum which were confirmed by results of dna sequencing however a few sspi rflp products yielded an upper band and a lower band that were slightly smaller than pcr products of c parvum dna sequencing indicated that they were c bovis or cryptosporidium deer-like genotype a few pcr products had a combination of the regular and the smaller upper bands dna sequencing indicated that they were c bovis fig 2 altogether c parvum was identified in 213 specimens c bovis in eight specimens and cryptosporidium deer-like genotype in three specimens the ssu rrna sequences of c parvum c bovis and the deer-like genotype were identical to those from these species previously reported in the united states xiao et al 2002 santin et al 2004

 of the 224 specimens analyzed by gp60 pcr 216 produced products of the expected size including all 213 specimens identified as c parvum by ssu rrna pcr and three of the eight specimens identified as c bovis these products were sequenced successfully except for five which had sequence ambiguity at the 5 end alignment of the sequences obtained with reference sequences revealed that 215 sequences belonged to the c parvum subtype family iia whereas the remaining sequence obtained from one c parvum-infected calf had less than 90 homology to other sequences thus belonged to a new c parvum subtype family altogether 16 iia subtypes were found in neonatal calves studied fig 3 which differed from each other only in the number of tca designated by the letter a and tcg designated by the letter g repeats all iia subtype sequences had only one copy of the acatca sequence designated by the letter r the most common subtype was iiaa18g3r1 which was found in 120 calves other less common subtypes included iiaa15g2r1 iiaa17g2r1 iiaa19g4r1 iiaa20g3r1 iiaa19g3r1 iiaa17g3r1 iiaa20g5r1 iiaa18g2r1 and iiaa20g2r1 which were seen in 28 19 15 6 5 5 3 2 and 2 calves respectively the new subtype family and other iia subtypes iiaa16g3r1 iiaa17g1r1 iiaa18r1 iiaa19g2r1 iiaa20g4r1 and iiaa21g2r1 were each found in only one animal all five sequences with 5 end ambiguity belonged to iia subtype family fig 3

 among the four more common iia subtypes iia18g3r1 was found year around in all geographic areas in northern ireland fig 4 subtype iiaa15g2r1 though much less common was also found at low frequency in all areas with the exception of a high occurrence in april 2002 subtype iiaa17g2r1 also mainly occurred in april 2002 but this was mostly due to the more extensive sampling of animals on a farm in the lough neagh basin area during an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in which all positive animals were infected with the subtype subtype iiaa19g4r1 was found sporadically over the year fig 4 predominantly in animals within a 15-mile radius in the north antrim area suggesting the possibility of some common point of infection or transmission

 previous studies in other countries have shown cryptosporidium rotavirus coronavirus and enterotoxigenic e coli are some common causes of diarrhea in neonatal calves less than 30 days old reynolds et al 1986 holland 1990 mcdonough et al 1994 de la fuente et al 1998 bendali et al 1999 naciri et al 1999 results of this study suggest that the same is also true in northern ireland the high prevalence of cryptosporidium and rotavirus in neonatal calves in the current study is in agreement with similar studies conducted in spain and france which also showed lower prevalence of coronavirus and enterotoxigenic e coli than the other two pathogens de la fuente et al 1998 1999 naciri et al 1999 garcia et al 2000 similar to what was observed before moore and zeman 1991 garcia et al 2000 concurrent cryptosporidium and rotavirus infections were common in the present study the higher occurrence of cryptosporidium infections in neonatal calves during winter and spring months is consistent with farming practice in northern ireland because of the adverse climatic conditions prevailing in northern ireland during the winter months of october through to march most stock is housed indoors during this period this is accompanied by a concomitant increase in the numbers of susceptible calves being born while cows are housed indoors this potentially provides ideal conditions for the transmission of cryptosporidium in newborn calves either from direct contact with infected animals or from contaminated bedding or housing an infection source previously identified atwill et al 1998 the lower detection rates during summer months were probably due to reductions in the numbers of symptomatic animals as a result of turnout of calves to pasture and a seasonal reduction in the numbers of calves being born similar patterns of spring and winter peaks have previously been seen in the united states xiao and herd 1994 mohammed et al 1999 the genotype distribution of cryptosporidium seen in neonatal calves is very similar to that recently reported in the united states with most infections due to c parvum and c bovis and the deer-like genotype only occasionally seen in neonatal calves younger than 30 days santin et al 2004 the conservative nature of the ssu rrna gene sequences for the three species in different geographic areas indicates that the age-related infections with different cryptosporidium spp previously observed in the united state probably also occurs in cattle in northern ireland the existence of 17 c parvum subtypes may be indicative of a high genetic diversity of c parvum in northern ireland previous studies in portugal united states and canada have identified only a few c parvum gp60 subtypes in calves in each area alves et al 2003 2006 peng et al 2003b trotz-williams et al 2006 it is not clear whether the higher parasite diversity seen in this study was due to more extensive sampling of many farms previously a multilocus typing study also demonstrated the existence of many subtypes in calves in scotland mallon et al 2003b the existence of several subtypes in a small area in theory can be the result of infected animals being brought into the area either from local national or international sources and introduction of these new subtypes to the native cattle population however the majority of calves on northern ireland farms are either home-bred or bought in from local sources such as livestock marts so it is more likely the high genetic diversity of the parasite seen here represents geographic isolation due to reduced movement of animals between farms over half of the animals examined in northern ireland were infected with the subtype iiaa18g3r1 this subtype was previously seen in two waterborne outbreaks of human cryptosporidiosis in northern ireland in 2000 and 2001 glaberman et al 2002 it was also seen in two sporadic human cases in australia and one calf in canada chalmers et al 2005 trotz-williams et al 2006 the widespread distribution both geographically and temporally indicates the successful transmission capabilities of this subtype either by direct animal-to-animal contact or through environmental contamination it is interesting to note that another more widely distributed c parvum subtype iiaa15g2r1 was only seen in 13 of infected calves the latter was responsible for 85 of c parvum infections in calves and other ruminants in portugal alves et al 2006 and has been found in humans and calves in the united states canada united kingdom portugal slovenia australia japan and kuwait glaberman et al 2002 peng et al 2003b stantic-pavlinic et al 2003 wu et al 2003 chalmers et al 2005 sulaiman et al 2005 abe et al 2006 alves et al 2006 trotz-williams et al 2006 in addition to iiaa18g3r1 and iiaa15g2r1 six other subtypes found in calves in the present study including iiaa17g2r1 iiaa20g3r1 iiaa19g3r1 iiaa17g3r1 iiaa19g2r1 and iiaa20g4r1 were previously reported in humans in northern ireland glaberman et al 2002 another subtype in calves iiaa17g1r1 has been found in three outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in neighboring england and wales that were associated with direct contact with animals or consumption of contaminated water chalmers et al 2005 the similar distribution of c parvum subtypes between humans and calves in the same geographic area suggests a role for calves in the transmission of human cryptosporidiosis in this area even though more studies are clearly needed to assess the extent of calf-to-human transmission as expected the anthroponotic c parvum iic subtype family which is the most common type of c parvum in humans in most countries alves et al 2003 xiao et al 2003 xiao and ryan 2004 was not seen in calves in the current and in previous studies in conclusion results of the study have shown the occurrence of c bovis and the cryptosporidium deer-like genotype in the calves in northern ireland and the uniqueness of c parvum transmission on farms in northern ireland with one predominant subtype in neonatal calves the widespread occurrence of the subtype in calves and humans demonstrates the genetic fitness of the parasite in the transmission of cryptosporidiosis it also raises some concerns about the selection of highly infectious subtypes by intensive animal husbandry future multilocus subtyping studies would increase our understanding of the transmission dynamics of c parvum in cattle and humans  clinical disease in children associated with newly described coronavirus subtypes objectives coronaviruses cause upper respiratory illness and occasionally lower tract disease in susceptible populations in this study we examined the prevalence of 4 human coronaviruses including subtypes oc43 229e and the recently described nl63 and hku1 in a pediatric population presenting to a childrens hospital patients and methods specimens collected over a 1-year period from pediatric patients presenting with acute respiratory illness were analyzed for the presence of 4 coronavirus subtypes using consensus and subtype-specific real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with coronavirus infection were examined retrospectively results coronaviruses were detected in 66 of 1043 children eight 11 19 and 28 specimens were positive for subtypes 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 respectively coronaviruses were detected throughout the study period all 4 of the subtypes were present simultaneously in december the acute clinical features were similar across subtypes of 32 children infected with a coronavirus as the sole respiratory pathogen 13 had lower respiratory tract disease children whose only detectable respiratory virus was a coronavirus were more likely to have underlying chronic disease than were children coinfected with another respiratory virus conclusions although 4 subtypes of coronavirus were detected the recently discovered coronavirus subtypes nl63 and hku1 accounted for the majority of coronaviruses detected in our cohort of mostly hospitalized children with respiratory symptoms new subtypes likely represent a substantial portion of previously unexplained respiratory illnesses kuypers jane  martin emily t  heugel judson  wright nancy  morrow rhoda  englund janet a cryo-em structures of hku2 and sads-cov spike 1 glycoproteins and insights into coronavirus evolution 2 3 4 jinfang yu shuyuan qiao runyu guo xinquan wang  a new porcine coronavirus sads-cov was recently identified from suckling piglets 20 with severe diarrhea in southern china and its genome sequence is most identical 95 21 identity to that of bat -coronavirus hku2 it again indicates bats are the natural 22 reservoir of many coronaviruses that have great potential for cross-species transmission 23 to animals and humans by recombination andor mutation here we report the cryo-em 24 structures of hku2 and sads-cov spike glycoprotein trimers at 238  and 283  25 resolution respectively hku2 and sads-cov spikes exhibit very high structural 26 similarity with subtle differences mainly distributed in the ntd and ctd of the s1 27 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding we systematically 28 analyzed and compared the ntd ctd sd1 and sd2 domains of the s1 subunit and 29 the s2 subunit of hku2 spike with those of - - - and -coronavirus spikes the 30 results show that the ntd and ctd of hku2sads-cov are probably the most 31 ancestral in the evolution of spike although the s2 subunit mediating membrane fusion 32 is highly conserved the connecting region after fusion peptide in hku2sads-cov 33 s2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses these results 34 structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between hku2 sads-cov 35 and -coronavirus spikes and provide new insights into the evolution and cross-species 36 transmission of coronaviruses 37 38 39 coronaviruses categorized into the order nidovirales family coronaviridae and 40 subfamily coronavirinae are a large group of viral pathogens with a wide host range 1  41 their infections in humans other mammals and birds can cause respiratory hepatic 42 enteric and neurological diseases with varying severity 2  the severe acute respiratory 43 syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus 44 mers-cov have posed severe threats to human health in the 21 st century 13  in the 45 meantime coronaviruses infecting domestic animals also bring substantial economic 46 losses 4  for example the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov 47 also known as seacov and peav isolated in 2017 caused outbreaks of severe watery 48 diarrhea of suckling piglets with a mortality up to 90 in several commercial pig farms 49 in guangdong province of china 5-10  sads-cov is an -coronavirus and other 50 representative members in the -genus are porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 51 pedv porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev porcine respiratory 52 coronavirus prcv human nl63 and 229e coronaviruses hcov-nl63 and hcov-53 229e 1  representative members in other three genera include mouse hepatitis 54 coronavirus mhv bovine coronavirus bcov sars-cov mers-cov hcov-55 oc43 and hcov-hku1 in the -genus avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv in the 56 -genus and porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov in the -genus 1  57 cross-species transmission promoted by genetic recombination andor mutations 58 underlies the host range expansion of coronaviruses 311-13  bats are the natural reservoir 59 of more than 30 different -and -coronaviruses that have great potential for 60 interspecies transmission by recombination andor mutation 1214-16  data on genetic 61 evolution receptor binding and pathogenesis have demonstrated that human sars-62 cov and mers-cov most likely originate from bats 1  palm civets and dromedary 63 camels are the intermediate hosts of sars-cov and mers-cov from bats to humans 1  64 respectively the newly identified porcine sads-cov isolates are also found to share 65 95 sequence identity with rhinolophus bat coronavirus hku2 and this further 66 stressed the severe results of coronavirus spillover from bats to domestic animals 5-10  67  however the molecular mechanisms underlying the transmission of sads-cov from 68 bats to pigs are still unknown and need to be further explored recently it was shown 69 that sads-cov is able to infect cells from a broad range of species including mouse 70 chicken pig monkey and human indicating a high potential of the sads-cov for 71 interspecies transmission 17  72 the spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses mediates viral entry by binding host 73 receptor with the s1 subunit and fusing viral and cellular membranes with the s2 74 subunit thereby determining viral host range and tissue tropism 18 19  as a class i viral 75 fusion protein the spike exists on the envelope of virion as a homotrimer and each 76 monomer contains more than 1000 amino acid residues that can be cleaved into s1 and 77 s2 subunits 18  for most coronaviruses the n-terminal domain ntd of the s1 subunit hcov-oc43 utilizes ntd to recognize glycans 29  and one exception is mhv which 83 utilizes the ntd to bind mouse receptor ceacam1a 30  therefore the s1 subunit 84 especially its ntd and ctd is the most variable region of the spike and is responsible 85 for different tropisms of coronaviruses in comparison the s2 subunit containing the 86 fusion peptide fp and heptad repeats hr1 and hr2 for membrane fusion are more 87 conserved in both sequence and structure 18 19  for the sads-cov receptor analysis 88 indicated that none of the known coronavirus protein receptors including ace2 dpp4 89 and apn are essential for the cell entry 717  there are also no reports regarding to the the spikes of sads-cov 1130 amino acid residues and hku2 1128 amino 102 acid residues are the shortest among all known coronavirus spike glycoproteins and 103 their amino acid identities to other known coronavirus spikes are lower than 28 104 indicating the spikes of hku2 and sads-cov are unique 5-1047  in this study we report 105 the cryo-em structures of the sads-cov and hku2 spike trimers at 283  and 238 106  resolution respectively the hku2 spike trimer structure is the first one from bat 107 coronavirus we analyzed the hku2 and sads-cov trimer structures and also 108 compared the ntd ctd sd1 and sd2 domains of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunit  protein expression and structure determination 116 the cdnas encoding hku2 spike yp001552236 and sads-cov spike 117 avm415691 were synthesized with codons optimized for insect cell expression hku2 ectodomains residues 1-1066 and sads-cov ectodomains residues 1-1068 119 were separately cloned into pfastbac-dual vector invitrogen with c-terminal foldon 120 tag and strep tag after expression in hi5 insect cells and purification to homogeneity 121 the cryo-em images on these two spike ectodomains were recorded using fei titan 122 krios microscope operating at 300 kv with a gatan k2 summit direct electron detector 123  supplementary fig 1  about 1400000 particles for hku2 spike and 900000 124 particles for sads-cov spike were subjected to 2d classification and a total of 125 421490 particles of hku2 spike and 152334 particles of sads-cov spike were selected and subjected to 3d refinement with c3 symmetry to generate density maps 127  supplementary fig 2  the overall density maps were solved to 238  for hku2 128 spike and 283  for sads-cov spike gold-standard fourier shell correlation  0143 129 supplementary fig 1 and supplementary fig 2  the atomic-resolution density map 130 enabled us to build nearly all residues of hku2 spike ectodomains residues 17-995 131 except for a few breaks residues 129-141 and 204-204 as well as 48 n-linked glycans 132 supplementary fig 3a and supplementary fig 4a  the final refined model of sads- cov spike contains residues 19-998 with some short breaks residues 134-143 and 488-134 490 and 45 n-linked glycans supplementary fig 3b and supplementary fig 4b  135 data collection and refinement statistics for these two structures are listed in overall structures of hku2 and sads-cov spikes 139 the overall structures of hku2 and sads-cov spikes we determined here resemble 140 the previously reported pre-fusion structures of coronaviruses spikes both spike 141 trimers have a mushroom-like shape 150  in height and 115  in width fig 1a  142 consisting of a cap mainly formed by -sheets of the s1 subunit a central stalk mainly 143 formed by -helices of the s2 subunit and a root formed by twisted -sheets and loops 144 of the s2 subunit fig 1a  in each trimer there is a c3 axis along the central stalk  fig   145 1a the amino acid identity between hku2 and sads-cov spikes is 86 and these c atoms of the trimer due to the high structural similarity we will use the hku2 149 structure to present the features of both spikes in the subsequent description whereas 150 significant differences between them will be pointed out only when necessary the s1 subunit of the hku2 spike comprises two major domains ntd and ctd 152 which are followed by two subdomains sd1 and sd2 connecting them to the s2 subunit 153  fig 1b and fig 1c  the s1 subunits from three monomers form the cap of the spike 154 in which the three ctds in the inner part are at the apex sitting on top of the central 155 stalk and the three ntds are located outside the ctds surrounding the central stalk  fig 1a  the ntd ctd sd1 and sd2 of the s1 subunit are all mainly composed of 157  strands regarding to the secondary structure feature fig 1c  in contrast the upstream 158 helix uh fusion peptide fp connecting region cr heptad repeat 1 hr1 and 159 central helix ch of the s2 subunit are mainly composed of helices whereas the -160 hairpin bh and subdomain 3 sd3 at the bottom part of the s2 subunit mainly consist 161 of  stands and loops fig 1c  moreover the residues after the sd3 which contain the the sd1 and sd2 of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunit are highly similar in amino fig 2b  besides c 234 -c 244 numbered in hku2 and connecting the bottom helix 216 to the bottom sheet is conserved in both subtype i and subtype ii ntds fig 2b  217 the ntds of -coronaviruses including bcov hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 218 mers-cov sars-cov and mhv resemble the subtype i rather than the subtype ii 219 ntd in the topology and distribution of the disulfide bonds fig 2c  these -220 coronavirus ntds have additional loops in the n-terminus between 1 and 2 strands 221 and between 6 and 7 stands numbered in hku2 structure forming an extensive 222 ceiling-like structure on top of the galectin-like fold fig 2c  it has been found that the the ctd of hku2 has a twisted five-stranded antiparallel  sheet as the core with 234 connecting loops between the stands fig 3a  it contains four disulfide bonds c 277 -235 c 300 and c 285 -c 290 at the n-terminus c 341 -c 397 at the c-terminus and the last one c 331 -236 c 369 connecting the 2 and 5 strands in the core  sheet fig 3a  interestingly the 237 ctd core of hku2 is of high structural similarity with the conserved ctd core of -238 coronaviruses and the disulfide bonds in the ctd of hku2 except for c 285 -c 290 are 239 also detected in all -coronavirus ctds fig 3b  these ctds have the core of one 240 twisted -sheet and here we name them as one-layer ctd subtype  fig 3a and fig 3b  the -coronavirus ctds always have

responsible for 244 binding their respective protein receptors 45  in the ctd of hku2 there is only one 245 short loop between the 5 and 6 strands of the core twisted -sheet fig 3a  246 although as members in the -genus hku2 and sads-cov ctd structures are 247 significantly different from those of other -coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-229e 248 pedv tgev and prcv that contain two layers of -sheets

and c 569 -c 596 numbered in pedv ctd fig 3c  the c 569 -c 596 is conserved 253 among all coronaviruses whereas the c 540 -c 586 is conserved in all -coronaviruses 254 except for hku2 and sads and -coronavirus pdcov fig 3c  the ctd of -coronavirus pdcov have a core of two -sheets belonging to the 256 two-layer ctd subtype fig 3c  as for the -coronavirus ibv the core of its ctd is 257 also similar to the typical two-layer ctd fig 3c  however several  strands are the sd1 and sd2 are two subdomains following the ctd in the s1 subunit linking 264 the ctd to the s2 subunit the hku2 sd1 is a partial  barrel consisting of five  265 strands and a disulfide bond c 409 -c 458  connecting its c-terminus to the 1 strand fig   266 4a this five-stranded  barrel and the linking disulfide bond are conserved among all 267 four genera of coronavirus fig 4a  the hku2 sd2 has a structure of two layers of 268 -sheet with an additional short -helix over the top sheet fig 4b  the additional -269 helix and the top sheet is linked by a disulfide bond c 482 -c 509  and another disulfide 270 bond c 524 -c 533  links the c-terminal loop to the bottom sheet fig 4b  the two-layer 271 core structure and the second disulfide bond are conserved among all genera of 272 coronavirus however the additional  helix and the first linking disulfide bond is a 273 distinct feature of -coronaviruses plus -coronavirus hku2 and sads-cov fig 4b  274 this additional helix appears to be an insertion between the primitive 2 and 3 strands 275 of the sd2 and is retained during evolution of -coronaviruses quaternary packing of the ntd and ctd in the spike 278 it has been observed that coronaviruses have two types of quaternary packing mode of 279 the s1 subunits in the trimer intra-subunit packing and cross-subunit packing 41  actually this is mainly caused by different positioning and interaction between ntd 281 and ctd in the spike monomer the hku2 s1 subunit similar to those in -282 coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-226e and pedv and -coronavirus pdcov have 283 an inward ctd which contacts with the ntd fig 5a  the three structural ntd-284 ctd modules in the cap region of these spikes are composed of ntd and ctd from 285 the same monomer forming the intra-subunit packing in the spike trimer fig 5a  the 286 s1 subunits of other coronaviruses in the and -genera including mhv sars-cov 287 mers-cov hcov-oc43 and ibv have an outward ctd that is far away from the 288 ntd fig 5b  therefore the three structural ntd-ctd modules in the cap region 289 of these spikes have the ntd from one monomer and the ctd from the adjacent 290 monomer forming the cross-subunit packing in the spike trimer fig 5b  interestingly 291 we found that the outward ctds always have an insertion in the core structure such 292 as -coronavirus ctds and -coronavirus ibv ctd fig 5b  in contrast all inward 293 ctds only have the one-layer or two-layer core structure without obvious inserted 294 region 297 sequence analysis suggested that the s1s2 protease cleavage site at the boundary 298 between the s1 and s2 subunits is r544-m545 in hku2 spike and r546-m547 in 299 sads-cov spike 5847  compared to the s1 subunit the topology and structure of s2 residues 888-929 and a -sandwich like sd3 residues 930-995  fig 1b and fig 6a  305 like in other coronavirus spikes in the prefusion state the model of hr2 after sd3 was 306 not built in the structure due to poor density five disulfide bonds in s2 are detected two of them c 590 -c 612 and c 595 -c 601  stabilize the folded helices of uh c 696 -c 706 308 bends the cr c 884 -c 895 links the ch and the bh and c 934 -c 943 is within the sd3 fig   309 6a the first four disulfide bonds are conserved in all coronaviruses and the last one fig 4  the typical cr 321 in the s2 subunit contains three helices and one short strand with a disulfide bond 322 bending the first and second helix to form a turning fig 6b  in hku2 the second 323 helix is replaced by a short strand 713-716 and the third helix is replaced by a loop 324 721-741 therefore there are two short strands and only one helix in hku2 cr fig   325 6c the conserved disulfide bond c 696 -c 706 makes the first helix of cr in hku2 spike 326 turn upside down the s2 cleavage site between r671 and s672 is then covered by 327 the reversed cr helix and loops and r671 interacts with e723 in the loop and k697 328 and k698 in helix 1 fig 6c  in other coronaviruses taking the mhv s2 for example 329 the helix 1 does not cover the s2 site between r869 and s870 and r869 only loosely 330 interacts with t929 in helix 3 fig 6b  after the dissociation of the s1 subunit triggered the hku2 and sads-cov have one ntd in the s1 subunit and their structures 358 are more similar to the ntd1 than the ntd2 of -coronaviruses hcov-nl63 and 359 pedv whereas the only ntd of hcov-229e is structurally more similar to the ntd2 360 than the ntd1 fig 2  therefore we suggest that -coronaviruses have two subtypes 361 of ntd the evolution relationship between them are not clear yet it was once 362 suggested that the presence of two ntds in hcov-nl63 is a result of gene 363 duplication 31  however the sequence identity between these two ntds is only 157 364 in hcov-nl63 and 129 in pedv considering that hku2 sads-cov and 365 hcov-229e have one ntd belonging to either subtype i or subtype ii a more plausible 366 evolution way of the ntd in -coronaviruses is the recombination of two separate 367 primitive domains into the genome resulting in the presence of two ntds in the s1 368 subunit -coronaviruses including hcov-nl63 and pedv to be note these two ntd fig 2d  in contrast the -coronavirus pdcov ntd is similar to the 377 hcov-229e ntd representing the subtype ii in both architecture and disulfide bond 378 positions fig 2e  a previous study of the ibv spike proposed that -coronavirus 379 ntds are probably the most ancestral and the ntds of the four genera form an 380 evolutionary spectrum in the order of - - - and -genus 41  our proposal here is 381 similar to the previous one in the point that two ntd subtypes in -coronaviruses may 382 represent primitive structures that could be the evolutionary ancestors of ntds however we argue that the evolution pathways may not be in the order of - - - 384 and -genus a more plausible pathway is that the - -and -coronavirus ntds may 385 evolve independently and parallelly from subtype i -and -coronavirus ntds or 386 subtype ii -coronavirus ntds supplementary fig 7b  the hku2 and sads-cov ctd structure have a one-layer core consisting of a a

infections satyendra tripathi c vishwajit deshmukh chad creighton j ashlesh patil dr satyendra c tripathi  the current pandemic covid-19 has affected most severely to the people with old age or with comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes mellitus chronic kidney disease copd and cancers cancer patients are twice more likely to contract the disease because of the malignancy or treatment-related immunosuppression hence identification of the vulnerable population among these patients is essential it is speculated that along with ace2 other auxiliary proteins dpp4 anpep enpep tmprss2 might facilitate the entry of coronaviruses in the host cells we took a bioinformatics approach to analyze the gene and protein expression data of these coronavirus receptors in human normal and cancer tissues of multiple organs here we demonstrated an extensive rna and protein expression profiling analysis of these receptors across solid tumors and normal tissues we found that among all renal tumor and normal tissues exhibited increased levels of ace2 dpp4 anpep and enpep our results revealed that tmprss2 may not be the co-receptor for coronavirus in renal carcinoma patients the receptors expression levels were variable in different tumor stage molecular and immune subtypes of renal carcinoma in clear cell renal cell carcinomas coronavirus receptors were associated with high immune infiltration markers of immunosuppression and t cell exhaustion our study indicates that cov receptors may play an important role in modulating the immune infiltrate and hence cellular immunity in renal carcinoma as our current knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms will improve it may help us in designing focused therapeutic approaches  coronavirus cov disease-2019 has been declared as a pandemic by the world health organization who after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-cov-2 sars-cov-2 ng et al 2020  the primary host for the sars-cov-2 has been identified as bats and the terminal host as humans khan et al 2020  the related research revealed that sars-cov und sars-cov-2 share approximately 76 of amino acid identity  the primary symptoms include fever dry cough dyspnea diarrhea myalgia headache hyposmia and with common complications like acute respiratory distress 29 acute cardiac injury 12 and acute renal injury 7 huang et al 2020  it has been well established that covs require the ace2 or dpp4 receptors for entry into the host cells seys et al 2018 walls et al 2020 wrapp et al 2020  the organs or the cells expressing ace2 are more vulnerable to the cov infection glowacka et al 2011  according to hoffmann et al  the viral entry in the host cell depends on the sars-cov receptor ace2 for binding and requires the tmprss2 for priming and also relies on tmprss2 activity hoffmann et al 2020  therefore it is speculated that other auxiliary proteins or co-receptors might facilitate the entry of covs in the host cells these coreceptors or auxiliary proteins include tmprss2 anpep enpep qi et al 2020  therefore it has been proposed that organs representing the co-expression of co-receptors or auxiliary proteins such as tmprss2 anpep or enpep for ace2 and dpp4 are more susceptible for the viral entry replication and severity of the disease the thought of extrapulmonary spread is not evitable due to the presence of these receptors and co-receptors the prominent population with increased risk of virus infection are older patients and those associated with comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes mellitus chronic kidney disease copd and cancers sun et al 2020  viral infection with comorbidities is responsible for higher mortality according to lee and colleagues cancer patients are twice more likely to contract the infection than the normal population lee et al 2020  patients who received chemotherapy or surgery within the 30 days before the covid-19 pandemic have more risk of infection than the patients who had not undergone chemotherapy or surgery sharma et al 2020  according to an analysis of italian patients published in march 20 of those who died from covid-19 in the country had active cancer  notably the guidelines for cancer patients during the covid-19 pandemic focus on lung cancer patients undergoing active chemotherapy or radical radiotherapy and on patients with blood cancers burki 2020  the association of these receptors with the pathogenicity of the solid tumors is still to be solved in the present study we investigated molecular profiling data of the various proteins required for the entry of the covs in normal tissues and cancer tissues immunological aspects of the study of pathogenesis cannot be overlooked therefore we also explored an immune perspective concerning cancer understanding the usage of the multiplicity of receptors and co-receptors by the various covs can open new avenues for understanding the pathogenesis and development of intervention strategies sars-cov-2 requires ace2 as its receptor for host cell entry which is involved in various biological functions primarily in the renin-angiotensin system  figure 1a  dpp4 anpep enpep and tmprss2 have also been proposed as co-receptors to initiate sar-cov-2 infection qi et al 2020  string pathway analysis revealed a high confident interaction between these proteins which have peptidase activity and are involved in angiotensin system peptide metabolism and viral entry into the host cell  figure 1b and table 1  hence we extracted the rna and protein expression data of all these receptors in healthy tissues and solid tumors we found enrichment of ace2 at rna levels in testis small intestine and kidney  figure 1c  along with ace2 enrichment of rnas for the other four co-receptors occurred in normal lung mammary liver prostate thyroid head and neck tissues small intestine and kidney tissues  figure 1c  the protein expression levels of ace2 and coreceptors showed a similar expression pattern as to their rna  figure 1e  renal tumors exhibited the highest expression of ace2 receptor among solid tumor tissues followed by gastrointestinal cancers such as colorectal pancreatic and stomach cancer  figure 1d  dpp4 anpep and enpep rna expression were also elevated in renal tumors compared to other cancer tissues of note tmprss2 rna expression was highest in prostate cancer tissues whereas renal tumors featured among the lowest expressing tissues tcga data analysis also showed increased expression of all receptors except tmprss2 in renal tumor tissues as compared to their adjacent normal sup fig 1  we found that protein level data was also in concordance to rna expression data in solid tumors renal cancer expressed higher percent positivity of all receptors except tmprss2 which exhibited the highest percent positivity in prostate tumor tissues  figure 1f g we observed that ace2 anpep enpep and dpp4 gene expression was higher in renal papillary carcinoma kirp and renal clear cell carcinoma kirc whereas tmprss2 showed increased expression in renal chromophobe kich figure 2a and sup fig 2a  we further analyzed the correlation of ace2 with all four receptors in each renal cancer types we observed a statistically significant correlation of ace2 with dpp4 in kich p001   0365 kirc p0001   0494 kirp p0001   0393 and also with anpep in kirp p0001   0277  figure 2b  and also negatively correlated with tumor stages in kirp tumor tissues along with anpep   -0153 p005 enpep only showed a significant   -0112 p001 negative correlation with tumor stages in kirc tumors  figure 2c  as molecular subtypes of kirp are well defined we also analyzed the expression pattern of these receptors in various molecular subtypes we observed that all cov receptors showed significantly p0001 kruskal-wallis test increased expression in c1 c2a and c2b subtypes compared to c2c-cimp subtype of kirp subtype with high dna methylation  figure 2d  had a higher expression of tmprss2  figure 3a and supl fig 2b  we also analyzed the correlation between the cov receptor genes and immune cell signatures for each of the 32 cancer types in tcga the cov receptors tended to show a high correlation with immune signatures in most cancer types though ace2 and tmprss2 exhibited weaker correlations than other receptors supl fig 2c  further we specifically analyzed ace2 which is a primary sars-cov receptor and dpp4 highly correlated to ace2 across the kidney cancer subtypes along with immune cell signatures innate and adaptive immunity inflammatory cytokines and chemokines we observed that ace2 and dpp4 exhibited increased expression in all molecular subtypes except kich cimp subtype of kirp and cc-e3 kirc subtype  figure 3b  we found that these receptors are highly correlated to the innate and adaptive immunity-related cells as well as il-10 il-6 cxcl10 ccl2-ccl5 tgfb1 in kirc tumors whereas in kiprp tumor tissues il8 il1a and tnf were highly correlated  figure 3b  our results revealed that in kirc tumors the expressions of various markers of exhausted t cells cd137 pd1 ctla4 and immunosuppressive microenvironment pdl1 pdl2 were also significantly p 001 t-test correlated to cov receptors supl fig   2d  we 3  ace2 was only found to be significantly positively correlated to macrophage r  0329 p  104e-07 immune infiltrate in kirp subtype  figure 4a  on the other hand dpp4 was significantly positively and negatively correlated to macrophage r  0219 p  513e-04 and b cell r  -0147 p  185e-02 cd8 t cell r  0162 p  917e-03 immune infiltrate in kirp subtype  figure 4b  we observed either negative or no correlation of tmprss2 expression with immune infiltrates in renal carcinoma subtypes suppl fig 3a  we also found a significant correlation of anpep and enpep with immune filtrate in kirc as compared to kirp tumors suppl fig 3b and   3c  immune infiltrates of b cells cd8 t cells macrophages and dcs significantly correlated with these receptors except tmprss2 in kich tumors  figure 4 and suppl fig 3  these results strongly suggest a variable host immune response to cov infection depending upon the renal carcinoma subtypes there is an increased risk of coronavirus related fatalities in the subpopulation with any underlying health conditions or comorbidities the risk factors for an increased susceptibility for cov infection include but not limited to diabetes heart disease hypertension chronic renal disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease smoking and cancer  cancer patients especially those undergoing chemotherapy and other anti-cancer treatment have increased risk of mortality due to cov infection lee et al 2020  the precise mechanism of increased severity in cancer remains unclear in this study we did landscape profiling of cov receptors and co-receptors viz ace2 tmprss2 anpep enpep and dpp4 in various normal and cancer cells our findings are in concordance with previous studies reporting ace2 expression in stratified epithelial cells colon lung liver and kidney single-stranded rna viruses can have multiple receptors for their host cell entry zhang et al 2019  sars-cov utilizes ace2 cd209 clec4g and clec4m for its infection to host marzi et al 2004 yang et al 2004 gramberg et al 2005 wang et al 2008  a recent study has suggested a few other receptors such as dpp4 anpep enpep and tmprss2 as co-receptorsauxiliary proteins to complement ace2 in initiating sar-cov-2 infection qi et al 2020  we analyzed the data available on the gtex portal and observed the co-occurrence of these receptors in the small intestine and kidney at both rna and protein levels corona infection is a multiorgan diseased condition and not limited to the lungs few studies have reported low levels of ace2 in lung parenchyma as compared to other normal tissues jia et al 2005 qi et al 2020  cell type specificity also exists for ace2 expression such as in lung expression is mainly in alveolar cells type 2 pneumocytes and immune cells b cells t cells or myeloid cells qi et al 2020  in kidneys most of the cells of proximal collecting tubules and proximal straight tubules exhibit increased expression and enpep along with ace2 receptors we found that the expression of these receptors is inversely correlated to tumor stage and varies by molecular subtypes in renal carcinoma as host immune response is crucial to eradicating viral infection immunological aspects related to these receptors cannot be overlooked we observed that cov receptors tend to show a high correlation with immune signatures in most cancer types we further explored the possibility whether cov receptors are involved in modulating tumor immunity our analysis revealed for the first time that these receptors were correlated with immune cell infiltration in renal carcinoma our findings supported the immunoregulatory functions as follows ace2 dpp4 anpep and enpep expression is closely related to the infiltration level of b cells cd8 t cell macrophage neutrophil and dendritic cell cytokine storm has been well-defined and described with the pathogenesis of the disease chemokines are involved in several biological processes such as the development of innate and acquired immunity embryogenesis and cancer metastasis coperchini et al 2020  these chemokines along with cytokines recruit different immune cells poeta et al 2019  we found that ace2 and dpp4 were highly expressed and significantly correlated to the innate and adaptive immunity-related cells as well as il-10 il-6 cxcl10 ccl2-ccl5 tgfb1 in kirc tumors only upregulation of cxcl10 can enhance the levels of tumor-infiltrating cd8 t cell and natural killer cells humblin and kamphorst 2019 kikuchi et al 2019 petty et al 2019  t regulatory cells and macrophages get recruited by ccl5 walens et al 2019  these results indicate that cov receptors can play an important role in cellular immunity by modulating the immune infiltrate via cytokines and chemokines secretion cancer cells also can evade the immune system by promoting t cell dysfunction and exhaustion jiang et al 2015 thommen and schumacher 2018  we analyzed the expression of inhibitory immune-checkpoint molecules in renal carcinoma subtypes to understand the dysregulation of the tumor microenvironment our results revealed that the expressions of various markers of exhausted t cells cd137 pd1 ctla4 and immunosuppressive microenvironment pdl1 pdl2 are highly correlated to cov receptors in kirc tumors therefore targeting these cov receptors along with immune checkpoint inhibitors in coronavirus positive kirc patients can be beneficial our study has some limitations as our findings are based on correlation and associations drawn on analysis of data extracted from several public databases further experiments are warranted to confirm the role of cov receptors in immune modulation of renal carcinoma in conclusion our bioinformatics analysis revealed that renal carcinoma patients might be more susceptible to cov infection we found evidence that tmprss2 may not be the auxiliary protein for coronavirus infection in renal carcinoma ace2 and dpp4 increased expression in renal carcinoma tissues as compared to normal kidney this association suggests that these patients are at increased risk of case related fatalities than healthy subjects ace2 dpp4 anpep and enpep each associated with a high level of immune infiltration inflammatory chemokines cytokines and markers of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and t cell exhaustion in kirc tumors our study indicates that cov receptors may play an important role in modulating the immune infiltrate and hence cellular immunity in renal carcinoma we downloaded rna-seq gene expression profiling datasets from the genotype-tissue expression study gtex consortium for human normal tissues the normalized rna-seq data in transcripts per million tpm was utilized for further analysis we also downloaded rna-seq gene expression profiling datasets from the cancer genome atlas tcga httpswwwcancergovaboutnciorganizationccgresearchstructural-genomicstcga rsem normalized for human normal and cancer tissues the human

we downloaded the immunohistochemistry ihc data analysis of cov receptors protein in cancer and normal tissues pmid 24309898 the score of ihc-based protein expression was determined as the fraction of positive cells defined in different tissues 0  0-1 1  2-25 2  26-75 3  75 and intensity 0  negative 1  weak 2  moderate and 3  strong staining we utilized the combined data of positive fraction and intensity which is represented as high 3 moderate 2 low 1 or no 0 staining the ihc data representation for normal tissues was presented as staining of the protein for carcinoma tissues we used the percentage positivity based on tumor tissues with high or moderate staining compared to low or no staining detected representative images of normal kidney and renal tumor tissues were also acquired from the same source for analyses of interactions among cov receptors the string database which enables analysis for the structural and functional component of proteins szklarczyk et al 2017 was used the sources for establishing the interactions and enrichment of molecular functional processes were text mining experiments databases co-expression neighbourhood and co-occurrence and 04 was set as the cut-off criterion the tumor immune system interaction database tisidb httpcishkuhktisidb platform was used to analyze the correlation of ace2 with other cov receptors dpp4 anpep enpep tmprss2 expression in different renal carcinoma subtypes the correlation and association of cov receptors with tumor stage molecular subtypes and immuno-subtypes of renal carcinoma were also analyzed using the tisidb interface the tumor immune estimation resource timer httpscistromeshinyappsiotimer platform comprised of the immune infiltrate data from the tcga patients li et al 2016 li et al  2017  was used to investigate the association between cov receptors expression and the infiltration level of b cell cd4 t cell cd8 t cell neutrophil macrophage and dendritic cell diffexp module was used to investigate the spp1 expression between tumor and adjacent normal tissues across all tcga tumors the partial spearmans correlation and statistical significance after purity-correction were shown on the generated scatterplots to computationally infer the infiltration level of specific immune cell types using rna-seq data from renal cell carcinoma samples from tcga as described previously chen et al 2016  we used a set of 501 genes specifically overexpressed in one of 24 immune cell types bindea et al 2013  we analyzed various immune signatures including innate immunity adaptive immunity pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory chemokines the for pan-cancer correlation analyses we used the set of 10224 rna-seq profiles from 32 different cancer types as featured in our previous study chen et al 2018  using the bindea immune cell signature scores as computed for this study the correlation among cov receptors expression and with immune infiltration level was determined by the timer interface using spearmans correlation analysis and statistical significance and the strength of the correlation was determined using the following guide for the absolute value 000-019 weak 020-059 moderate 060-10 strong the association between the cov receptors expression and molecular or immune-subtypes in renal carcinoma was analyzed by the tisidb interface using the kruskal-wallis test for preparing the bar graph the data was analyzed using graphpad software version 601 graphpad software inc usa and presented as mean  sd p-values  005 were considered statistically significant previously chen et al 2016  three of these subtypes-cc-e1 cc-e2 and cc-e3-are enriched for clear cell rcc cases four other subtypes-p-e1a p-e1b p-e2 and pcimpe-are enriched for papillary rcc cases one

 opg c ryanae bovine cryptosporidiosis is one of the major causes of neonatal calf diarrhoea young calves 1 month of age are frequently infected with cryptosporidium sp qulez et al 1996 in france some epidemiological studies concerning infection with cryptosporidium sp in calves have recently been conducted follet et al 2011 rieux et al 2013a rieux et al 2013b our study showed that 92100 of the pre-weaned beef calves sampled during three successive years were infected with cryptosporidium before one month of age which is similar to the results reported by santn et al 2008 in dairy calves the average levels of excretion of cryptosporidium sp were also similar to what was reported in dairy calves by silverls et al 2010 however when including a pluri-annual approach we observed that the peak of excretion could occur at different ages depending on the year of sampling this peak occurred between 17 and 23 days of age in calves of the 1st cohort while it took place at around two weeks of age 1016 days in calves of the 2nd and 3rd cohorts this latter pattern being in agreement with previous data obtained with c parvum in dairy calves santn et al 2004 similarly the highest prevalence of cryptosporidiosis varied from one cohort to another in the first cohort the maximum prevalence was seen in animals aged 2430 days while these peaks were reached early in calves from the second and third cohorts between 1723 and 1016 days of age respectively both the earlier peaks of prevalence and excretion in cohorts 2 and 3 suggest a more intense contamination of the premises leading to a very early exposure of the calves silverls et al 2010 silverls et al 2013 as cryptosporidium oocysts are widely dispersed and can survive for months in the environment chalmers and giles 2010 the build-up of oocysts in a given environment if not modified by adapted disinfectants or cleaning procedures may represent a high risk to the newborn animals numerous studies have shown an age-related sequence of cryptosporidium species in dairy calves in our study we identified in beef calves aged less than one month of age the three species commonly reported in young cattle c parvum c bovis and c ryanae several authors have reported that the species c parvum constitutes the majority of infections in pre-weaned dairy calves while c bovis and c ryanae are found in older or weaned calves santn et al 2004 santn et al 2008 coklin et al 2009 for santn et al 2008 the first detection of c bovis and c ryanae took place later at 4 and 8 weeks of life respectively whereas other studies demonstrated earlier excretion of these species at 24 weeks of life feng et al 2007 silverls et al 2010 in our study we did observe an effect due to age and year of sampling on the distribution of cryptosporidium species in pre-weaned beef calves calves from the first cohort excreted mainly the species c bovis between 10 and 30 days of age whereas none of the calves from the third cohort excreted this species calves from the second cohort excreted c parvum and c bovis with similar age patterns 727 and 1130 days of age respectively and levels of excretion 500 to 2  106
 opg whereas calves from the third cohort excreted mainly the species c parvum from 4 to 26 days of age the species c ryanae was distinctly identified in older calves from 18 to 30 days old from each cohort and at lower levels of excretion range 1  103 to 22  105
 opg in view of these observations it is possible that neonatal calves are more susceptible to infection with c parvum and c bovis than to infection with c ryanae or the higher infection dose in calves could come with a shorter prepatent period because shedding rates could pass the detection level earlier than at a lower dose silverls et al 2013 as has been described in lambs blewett et al 1993 ortega-mora and wright 1994 these observations also confirm that the age-related occurrence of cryptosporidium species in calves is not totally well defined and varies according to the survey location the load of oocysts in the environment and notably calf management system feng et al 2007 geurden et al 2007 santn et al 2008 silverls et al 2010 budu-amoako et al 2012 the animals involved in our study were all housed together with the calves born earlier in the calving season this may explain why they were infected with species usually found in older calves in contrast with the dairy farms where neonates are usually raised separately from older animals however this hypothesis deserves further investigation because the observations of silverls and blanco-penedo 2012 showed that calves staying with the dam 3 days after birth excreted the same species of cryptosporidium than those immediately removed here we also observed differences in distribution of cryptosporidium species in the same cattle herd over time while animal management parameters remained comparable regarding clinical signs calves from the first cohort expressed no clinical signs while 8090 of calves from the second and third cohort were diarrhoeic on at least one occasion the three cryptosporidium species were found in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic samples although the species found in diarrhoeic samples was mainly c parvum the species c parvum is frequently recorded as the dominant species in diarrhoeic calves while c ryanae seems to occur in subclinical situations kv et al 2006 fayer et al 2008 santn et al 2008 the role of c bovis with regard to diarrhoea is more conflicting as this species has been described in both diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic samples from dairy calves silverls et al 2010 other enteric viral or bacterial pathogens e coli rotavirus coronavirus can be observed in calves during the first 3 weeks of life and can contribute to the severity of cryptosporidiosis de graaf et al 1999 here among the 40 diarrhoeic samples identified in calves 3 weeks of age from the third cohort 21 were found to be infected with c parvum only this observation confirms the clear implication of c parvum in the occurrence of clinical signs in beef calves less than 3 weeks of age lastly the risk to human health posed by cryptosporidium infection in beef calves was investigated the detection of the zoonotic species c parvum in beef calves between 4 and 26 days old confirmed the potential role of young beef calves in human cryptosporidiosis suggested by some authors atwill et al 2003 following analysis of a fragment of the gp60 gene to determine c parvum subtypes we obtained two subtypes belonging to the iia family in this study subtypes iiaa15g2r1 and iiaa18g1r1 were identified these subtypes were already described in calves alves et al 2006 plutzer and karanis 2007 soba and logar 2008 wielinga et al 2008 coklin et al 2009 follet et al 2011 subtype iiaa15g2r1 has been widely reported in calves and humans in several countries such as portugal slovenia the netherlands and france alves et al 2006 soba and logar 2008 wielinga et al 2008 follet et al 2011 rieux et al 2013b subtype iiaa18g1r1 was described for the first time in one diarrhoeic pre-weaned calf in hungary in 2007 by plutzer and karanis and was also found recently in young diarrhoeic calves in sweden silverls et al 2013 during our study this subtype was found in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic samples as well in a given farm the number of subtypes found can be restricted to only one when no animal movement occurs brook et al 2009 silverls et al 2013 in our study little trading within the cattle herd occurred but other livestock flocks dairy goats meat sheep were present at the same location and transportation of faecal material through animal workers cannot be ruled out another explanation could be that the other subtype iiaa18g2r1 were carried by exchange of faecal material by a new animal entering the herd such as a bull or by another individual working on the farm due to unreadable gp60 sequences of some isolates identified as c parvum it is also possible that both subtypes had been circulating in calves since the previous year but that the dominant subtype was subtype iiaa18g2r1 these results suggest that the dominant subtype of c parvum can vary in the same beef cattle herd from year to year moreover this observation confirms previous studies and strongly suggests a possible role for beef calves as a reservoir for human zoonotic isolates of c parvum in western france the authors declare that they have no conflicting interests  multicenter evaluation of the qiastat respiratory panela new rapid highly multiplexed pcr based assay for diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections marijo parina uffe schneider vest benoit visseaux robert jozi irene hannet jan lisby gorm kwok chan hung   acute respiratory tract infections arti are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and a frequent reason for seeking medical care 1 most pathogens have predilection for either the upper or lower respiratory tract but may move into the other compartment the etiology is diverse led by a high viral heterogeneity and also comprises bacteria 23 the health-related burden of acute respiratory tract infections is significant in defined populations like the very young the elderly the chronically ill with underlying comorbidities eg heart or lung disease diabetes the malnourished and the immunocompromised eg transplant recipients hiv-infected individuals 49 certain pathogens including influenza ab virus human orthopneumovirus also known as respiratory syncytial virus and bordetella pertussis conventionally require contact isolation of hospitalized patients when detected to avoid further institutional spread 10 their fast detection and identification are essential for infection control effectiveness acute respiratory signs and symptoms are seldom specific for a single pathogen and detection strategies that allow for multiple agents to be simultaneously detected may have a significant impact on infectious disease management 1113 for the patient the ability to rapidly and accurately rule in out a respiratory pathogen supports optimized overall care eg hospital admission or not and therapy selections eg terminating unnecessary antimicrobials and targeted use of antiviral agents 1418 from a public health perspective syndromic respiratory infection testing has shown to be a useful tool for seasonal and sporadic outbreak surveillance and preparedness 19 supporting the effective management of health care resources 20 thus as respiratory viruses and their potential role are increasingly acknowledged the use of multiplex pcr testing is recommended since december 2018 by the infectious diseases society of america in all immunocompromised populations presenting with arti symptoms and also suggested in other populations if their results are taken into account to improve patients management 21 this study describes the first multicenter evaluation of the clinical performance characteristics of the qiastat respiratory

pathogens table 2 multiple pathogens were detected in 195 of the positive samples 65333 and the highest number of pathogens detected in a single sample was five human respirovirus 3 human orthorubulavirus 4 human coronavirus oc43 rhino-enterovirus and primate bocaparvovirus 12 the majority of multiple infection samples contained two pathogens which was the case for 5365 samples 815 the qiastat rp detected a bacterial pathogen in 76 of all samples 34445 in 25 out of 34 samples only bacteria were detected and in the remaining nine samples additional viral pathogens were detected four samples with two pathogens four samples with three pathogens and one sample with four pathogens the number of each potential pathogen detected by the qiastat rp in co-infections by hospitalization and by age group is presented in table 2 the most frequently detected pathogen was human orthopneumovirus which was detected in 98 samples 71 of which 724 came from patients less than 6 years of age the second most common pathogen was influenza a virus which was detected in 75 samples equally distributed between the h1 pdm2009 and h3n2 strains rhino-enterovirus was detected in 63 samples and influenza b virus was detected in 51 samples highlighting the very active influenza b virus season in early 2018 for 440 of 445 specimens 989 a valid result was obtained by the initial qiastat rp testing five samples 11 were invalid after the first qiastat rp testing comprising one run aborted by the analyzer 022 three runs with software errors 067 and one run in which the internal control failed to amplify 022 all five samples were retested with the qiastat rp and yielded a valid result after the second qiastat rp testing the performance characteristics for individual qiastat rp targets before discrepancy resolution are presented in table 3 and the performance characteristics after discrepancy resolution are presented in table 4 before resolution by discrepancy testing qiastat rp and filmarray rp agreed on the detection of 376 pathogens in the 445 samples table 3 for all pathogens except human mastadenovirus a-g rhino-enterovirus hmpv influenza a virus no subtype and human respirovirus 3 the agreement was excellent table 3 for human respirovirus 3 and influenza a virus no subtype the total number of positive samples by at least one method was only nine and five respectively for human mastadenovirus a-g the qiastat rp and filmarray rp agreed on 27 positive samples out of 41 initial positive samples table 3 after discrepancy testing the sensitivity for the qiastat rp was 971 3334 table 4 for rhino-enterovirus the qiastat rp and filmarray rp agreed on 49 positive samples out of the 71 initial positive samples after discrepancy testing the sensitivity for the qiastat rp was 944 5255 for hmpv the qiastat rp and filmarray rp agreed on 19 positive samples out of 21 initial positive samples after discrepancy testing the sensitivity was 950 1920 after resolution by discrepancy testing on the allplex rp a total of 402 pathogen results were considered as true positive table 4 of which qiastat rp detected 394 for an overall ppa of 980 95ci 960-991 after discrepancy testing the overall npa of the qiastat rp was 998 95ci 996-999 twenty-two pathogens detected by filmarray rp were not detected by qiastat rp table 3 fourteen of these were also not detected by allplex rp and were considered as true negatives leaving 8 pathogen detections as false negatives table 4 thirty-nine pathogens detected by qiastat rp were not detected by filmarray rp table 3 twenty-one of these were also not detected by allplex rp and were considered as false positives table 4 three of the 22 pathogens detected by filmarray rp but not detected by qiastat rp were detected in single infection samples and additional two of the pathogens not detected by qiastat rp were both detected in the same double infection sample the five pathogens involved were rhino-enterovirus three human mastadenovirus a-g one and human orthopneumovirus one all off these five pathogens were detected by the discrepancy method allplex rp the remaining 17 pathogens not detected by qiastat rp but detected by filmarray rp were from 17 samples with two or more pathogens three of these 17 pathogens one hmpv one influenza a virus no subtype and one human orthopneumovirus were detected by the discrepancy method adding up to a total of 8 false negative pathogens qiastat rp detected 39 pathogens not detected by filmarray rp 10 of these pathogens were in single infection samples and the detected pathogens were rhino-enterovirus n  1 ct value 276 influenza b virus n  1 ct value 207 influenza a virus no subtype n  1 ct value 342 influenza a virus subtype h3n2 n  2 ct values 327 and 337 human orthopneumovirus n  2 ct values 288 and 329 and human mastadenovirus a-g n  3 ct values 213 224 and 227 the influenza a virus with no detected subtype sample could not be discrepancy tested due to insufficient residual volume and was accordingly considered false positive by the qiastat rp one additional single-infection pathogen the rhino-enterovirus was considered false positive as this result could not be confirmed positive by discrepancy testing the remaining eight single-infection pathogens were confirmed positive by the discrepancy method and thus considered true positives table 4 the remaining 29 pathogens detected by qiastat rp but not detected by filmarray rp were from samples with two or more pathogens nineteen of these 29 pathogens ten rhino-enterovirus ct values 269 306 322 325 326 331 331 333 335 and 344 three human mastadenovirus a-g ct values 334 337 and 373 one human orthorubulavirus 4 ct value 336 one mycoplasma pneumoniae ct value 333 two primate bocaparvovirus 12 ct values 341 and 349 and two human coronavirus hku1 ct values 317 and 331 could not be confirmed by discrepancy testing and were thus considered false positives for a total of 21 false positive pathogens table 4 the remaining 10 pathogens were confirmed by the allplex rp from samples with two or more pathogens three human mastadenovirus a-g ct values 305 308 and 333 three rhino-enterovirus ct values 297 300 and 322 human orthopneumovirus ct value 162 two influenza a virus subtype h3n2 and one influenza a virus no subtype with no available ct value it was not possible to assess the sensitivity of the qiastat rp for legionella pneumophila or influenza a virus subtype h1n1 as these organisms were not detected by any of the methods primate bocaparvovirus 12 was detected by the qiastat rp in five specimens all containing at least one other potential pathogen the allplex rp confirmed the detected primate bocaparvovirus 12 in three of five specimens because primate bocaparvovirus 12 is not included in the panel of the reference method the results are listed separately and are expressed as ppanpa this study demonstrates for the first time the clinical performance of the new qiastat rp assay for detection of 21 respiratory pathogens by comparison to the filmarray rp the overall ppa and npa after discrepancy testing were 980 95 ci 960-991 and 998 95 ci 996-998 respectively in general the qiastat rp assay showed excellent agreement with filmarray rp for all pathogens included on the qiastat rp test menu except rhino-enterovirus 52 tp and 379 tn samples influenza a virus no subtype 3 tp and 440 tn samples and hmpv 19 tp and 425 tn samples the qiastat rp showed sensitivityppa 97 and specificitynpa 99 table 4 the reason for the discordant results for rhino-enterovirus is not known but may potentially be explained by different diagnostic tests targeting different genetic regions of the rhinoenterovirus genome the ct values for the pathogen targets present in the discrepant qiastat positive rp and filmarray rp negative samples were detected by qiastat with ct values in the range 3037 which may be considered as weakly positive only three targets were detected as qiastat rp positive and filmarray rp negative target with ct values below 30 one human orthopneumovirus ct 162 and two rhino-enterovirus ct 269 and 297 and thus as strong positive samples it would have been beneficial to resolve discrepancy results by sequencing as this potentially would have clarified the discordant results for rhino-enterovirus this was not possible as both the qiastat rp and filmarray rp as assays are performed in sealed samples-to-answer cartridges that are constructed to prevent access to sample material remaining in the cartridge the qiastat rp assay requires one manual pipetting step to load the patient sample into test cartridge the test cartridge id and patientsample id is entered by on-board scanner and the total assay time is approximately 69 minutes the qiastat dx diagcore analyzer offers a small footprint traceable internal inhibition controls by amplification curve as well as ct value low maintenance requirements and low failure rate as well as seamless connectivity and integration with hospital and laboratory information systems in addition the qiastat dx diagcore analyzer offers access to amplification curves and ct values of all detected pathogen targets the qiastat rp assay cartridge has on-board wet and dry reagents build-in amplification inhibition controls detects 21 pathogens in a total of 8 separate reaction chambers offers a direct dry swab testing option via a separate cartridge input port and stores at room temperature the qiastat rp is ce ivd marked and fda approval is pending the syndromic diagnostic approach for arti may provide multiple benefits for the institution eg prudent use of side room isolation facilities reduced prescription of antimicrobials targeted use of antivirals the benefits have been partly described in previous publications trabattoni et al reported a significant reduction in emergency department ed length of stay as well as a significant reduction in hospitalization rate for patients tested by the alere i influenza assay in the ed 22 and hansen et al reported a positive impact on admittance rate as well as total cost by roche liat influenza testing in the ed setting 14 brendish et al reported on encouraging findings of poc testing of respiratory viruses as their studies showed that this testing was associated with a reduced length of hospital stay resulted in more single doses or brief courses of antibiotics as well as in an improved influenza detection and antiviral use 15 however understanding of the full impact on patient management by the syndromic testing approach for arti as well as the cost-benefit will require more prospective outcome studies such studies would also provide information regarding which patient populations will benefit the most from respiratory tract syndromic testing and what the added benefits of syndromic testing compared to selected target testing eg influenza ab virus human orthopneumovirus hmpv bordetella pertussis or combinations hereof this study has several limitations first as this study was not designed as an epidemiological study the included clinical samples were not collected consecutively and the detected co-infection rates and the frequency of different pathogens in the co-infected samples may not reflect the actual co-infection rates in the patient population at the time of sample collection second as several pathogens eg coronaviruses b pertussis c pneumoniae and parainfluenzavirus 14 were only detected in few clinical samples the performance of the qiastat rp assay for detection of these pathogens is uncertain in conclusion in this first clinical study of the new qiastat rp assay performed in two diagnostic laboratories providing 445 clinical samples for analysis we observed excellent diagnostic accuracy of the qiastat rp assay compared to the comparator filmarray rp the qiastat rp assay could potentially impact positively on antimicrobial stewardship hospital admittance and use of side room contact isolation facilities  etiology and genetic evolution of canine coronavirus circulating in five provinces of china during

variety of mammals and several birds 12 its genome has ranged from 26 to 32 kb in length and currently can be divided into 4 genera named alpha beta gamma and delta coronavirus 3 considering the frequent mutation and recombination of coronavirus novel coronavirus variants continues to appear so far it has caused several serious public health safety incidents 45 in 2003 and 2012 two types of animal coronavirus transmitted into human population caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers respectively 67 since then researches on coronavirus has greatly increased recently a coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has been discovered in wuhan china which caused viral pneumonia and hyperpyrexia of patients 8 in addition there is evidence that sars-cov-2 can be transmitted from person to person 9 and suggested that sars-cov-2 may originated from chinese horseshoe bats 10 canine coronavirus has been described since 1971 11 and be regarded as an enterovirus which mainly caused mild diarrhea symptoms and showed high morbidity and low mortality 11 12 13 14 but in the case of co-infection with other pathogens such as canine adenovirus cav or canine parvovirus cpv ccov infection can cause severe clinical signs and even fatal cases 1516 furthermore fatal cases also be discovered in the cases without co-infection which subsequently be identified causing by high virulent strains named pantropic covs 17 18 19 ccov belongs to species alphacoronavirus 1 genus alphacoronavirus which is same to feline coronavirus fcov transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and porcine respiratory coronavirus prcov 3 in 2003 canine coronavirus was newly recognized as respiratory tract virus 20 unlike canine enteric coronavirus ccov canine respiratory coronavirus crcov belongs to beta coronavirus 2021 to data ccovs contains 2 distinct genotypes which named ccovi and ccov-ii 22 ccov-ii can be further divided into ccov-iia and ccov-iib 2324 however novel ccov variants such as a76 which not included in the two known genotypes has been discovered hence ccov-iic has ever been proposed 25 but considering the limited sequences identified this clade has not been publicly accepted yet in china canine coronavirus as one of the mainly pathogens has caused viral diarrhea in dog population the information concerning ccovs in recent years still limited in this study we conducted an etiological investigation and sequenced 7 nearly complete genomes and 10 complete spike gene of ccov and according to all the available ccov sequences to provides insights into viral etiology evolution and genetic diversity of currently strains circulating in china the aim of this study is to provide useful information for the future prevention of ccov during 20182019 we collected 231 feces or rectal swabs from diarrheic dogs in 5 provinces guangdong zhejiang heilongjiang jiangsu and anhui of china all the samples were diluted using five volumes phosphate-buffered saline ph 72 and then centrifuged viral rna was extracted from the supernatant using a viral dnarna kit cw biotech jiangsu china according to the manufacturers protocol reverse transcription was conducted using a hiscript ii 1st strand cdna synthesis kit vazyme nanjing china ccov was detected by selectively amplifying a 409bp fragment of m gene as previously described 26 all the positive samples were subjected to screen for other canine enteric virus by the methods previously described including cpv 27 caastv 28 cakv 29 ttcav 30 in addition primer pairs el1fel1r cepol-1tgsp-2 and s5fs6r which amplify ccovi ccov-iib and ccov-iia genes respectively were used to differentiate gene types of ccov as previously described 31 32 33 to amplify the genome of ccov we downloaded all the available genomes of ccov and then aligned using muscle in mega 70 program httpwwwmegasoftwarenet according to the conserved region of ccov genomes we designed 17 pairs of specific primers using oligo primer analysis software version 7 httpwwwoligonet table s1 in addition the amplified fragments of these 17 pairs of primers have overlapping portions to facilitate sequences assembling the pcr products were determined by a commercial company general biosystems anhui china sequences were assembled and analyzed using dnastar program madison usa moreover considering the short of samples and the primer specificity we cannot or solely obtained the partial genome of some samples to confirm the phylogenetic relationship between sequences identified here and those sequenced previously we retrieved all the complete s gene of ccov and partial of fcov and tgev from genbank httpswwwncbinlmnihgovgenbank as reference strains sequences alignment were conducted by clustalw in mega 70 program httpwwwmegasoftwarenet and then edited manually phylogenetic analysis was performed using raxml v8210 with the maximum likelihood method and gtr  gamma model the bootstrap value was set to 1000 phylogenetic trees were displayed and annotated using an online tool itol v5 httpsitolemblde the accession numbers of reference strains are provided in supplementary materials 1 recombination of b906zj2019 spike gene was analyzed using rdp 40 moreover phylogenetic analysis of n-terminal domain ntd c-terminal domain ctd and s2 subunit of b906zj2019 spike was performed phylogenetic trees were generated using raxml v8210 with gtr  gamma model and the bootstrap values was 1000 the sequences used are shown in the tree and the accession numbers are provided in supplementary materials 1 the ntd and ctd of cov spike gene were determined by alignment with ccov-a76 which has well defined ntd and ctd 34 furthermore the s1 and s2 subunit were determined as mentioned in previous study 25 in this study we collected 213 feces or rectal swabs from pet dogs with diarrhea of the 213 samples 51 2394 were positive for ccov moreover 36 out of 517059 samples co-infected with one or more enterovirus of the 36 co-infected samples 2941 1551 were solely co-infected with cpv 392 251 were merely co-infected with caastv 980 551 were only coinfected with cakv 196 were solely co-infected with ttcav the rest samples 1351 were co-infected with more than one canine enteric pathogens table 1
 to characterize the 51 ccov-positive samples the genotypes of these samples were determined ccovi ccov-iia and ccov-iib accounted for 980 551 5490 2851 and 588 351 respectively two or three genotypes multiple infections accounts for 2941 1551 table 2
 in addition of the 51 ccov-positive samples 2745 1451 were vaccinated according to the above positive samples of ccovs we amplified 7 nearly complete genomes and 10 full spike gene these sequences have been deposited in the genbank accession number mt114538-mt114554 the 7 nearly complete genomes shared 96499894 nucleotide similarities sequence analysis indicated that the 17 spike gene sequences were 43624422 nt in length sequences comparison of the complete s gene revealed 73249998 nucleotide and 63519993 amino identities the complete s gene-based genotyping indicated 16 of 17 were positive for ccov-iia except for b906zj2019 blast results showed the sequences of b906zj2019 shared 9324 nucleotide identities query coverage99 with a coronavirus variant strain named a76 accession number jn8560098 the spike gene of these16 ccov-iia strains shared 94599998 nucleotide and 95719993 amino acid sequence homology moreover the 16 ccov-iia strains displayed 87948853 nucleotide and 91229220 amino acid sequence homology with the ccov-iia reference strain bgf10 accession number ay342160 subsequently we investigated the amino acid variation in the s protein among ccov-iia strains sequenced here and the classical ccov-iia strains we found amino acid changes in around 45 residues most of these are located in s1 domain especially in ntd 7 and 8 of these positions are in ctd and s2 domain respectively fig 1
 to realize the evolution of ccov we reconstructed a ml tree using the complete spike gene the phylogenetic tree revealed that all the ccov strains can be divided into 2 genotypes named ccovi and ccov-ii ccov-ii further divided into three subtypes which are ccov-iia ccov-iib and ccov-ii variant ccovi and fcovi strains formed a clade ccov-iib and tgev strains clustered together and ccov-iia and fcov-ii strains clustered together in addition strain b906zj2019 and a76 formed a single clade which not belong to ccovi ccov-iia and ccov-iib group of the 17 strains identified in this study 16 strains fell into the ccov-iia group and showed closest relationship with strain gz43 which previously identified in china in 2003 and another strain hcm27 identified in vietnam in 2014 other 3 strains previous sequenced in heilongjiang of china also divided into ccov-iia and closely related to strain tn-449 which previously identified in the united states fig 2
 rdp4 results indicated b906zj2019 exhibited a strong recombination signal in seven methods to further characterize the recombination relationships among b906zj2019 and another coronavirus three ml tree of ntd ctd and s2 subunit of spike gene were constructed the sequence of b906zj2019 ntd formed a clade with a76 ccovi and fcovi strains fig 3
a the sequence of b906zj2019 ctd of b906zj2019 form a clade with a76 but not well cluster with ccovi and ccov-ii groups fig 3b in contrast the sequence of s2 domain of b906zj2019 clustered closely with these strains identified in this study which belong to ccov-iia fig 3c canine coronavirus is a causative agent for viral diarrhea in dogs and have been widely reported in japan 33 brail 35 greece 36 britain 32 china 37 italy 38 vietnam 39 australia 40 france and belgium 19 etc in china ccov is recognized as a common pathogen in pet dogs with positive rate 26 in diseased pet dogs in beijing 41 and 2836 in diarrhea dogs in heilongjiang 37 here the positive rates of ccov is 2394 51213 in pet dogs with apparent diarrhea symptoms which is nearly with the mentioned above in china but obvious lower than previous reported in japan and greece 36 505 and 651 in dogs with diarrhea respectively but higher than in brail12 in dogs with diarrhea 35 in addition ccov co-infected with other enteric viruses such as cpv cakv and cbov were frequent reported in diarrheic dogs 33374243 here 7059 ccov-positive samples were co-infected with one or more cpv caastv cakv ttcav strains in china the effective vaccines are available for most pet dogs but ccov still existed as one of the most common agents for viral enteritis 44 it is worth mentioning that among the positive samples of ccov 2745 pet dogs were well vaccinated which may indicate the incomplete protection of current vaccines considering most of vaccines were designed based on the classical ccov-iia strains it was likely not to effective against ccovi then many aa changes existed in current circulating ccov-iia in comparison with the classical ccov-iia strains whether the vaccine is effective is uncertain 25 multiple infection of ccovi and ccov-ii has been frequently reported in previously investigations 3145 in our study apart from the single infection with ccovi ccov-iia and ccov-iib two or three genotypes multiple infections accounts for 2941 1551 which indicates co-infection of different ccov subtypes were widely existed previously studies have reported that ccov-ii especially ccov-iia is the main subtypes circulating in heilongjiang of china during 20142015 and ccov-iib is the major subtypes circulating in vietnam 39 here of the ccov positive dogs 42 8235 dogs were positive for ccov-iia which is obvious higher than ccovi 2941 and ccov-iib 2353 these results revealed that ccov-iia play a more dominated role among pet dogs in china phylogenetic analysis of complete s gene indicated that canine coronavirus can be divided into 2 genotypes which consistent with previous studies 22 however in this study we discovered that ccov-ii can be divided into 3 distinct subtypes ccov-iia ccov-iib and ccov-ii variant which is differ from the 2 subtypes ccov-iia and ccov-iib as mentioned before in addition phylogenetic analysis results also revealed that ccov-iia is the predominate genotype currently circulating in china the strain b906zj2019 was clustered into ccov-ii variant with strain a76 which was identified a novel ntd with other ccov-ii strains and may as a result of recombination of ccovi and ccov-ii 34 recombination plays a vital role in genetic evolution of coronavirus and have high potential for the emergence of novel variants 46 ccov-iib was suggested as a novel recombinant variant which show close relationship with tgev 22 23 243247 strain b906zj2019 showed 9324 nucleotide similarity to a76 the entire spike gene of cov can cleave into s1 and s2 subunit and s1 subunit including n-terminal domain ntd and c-domain 2548 recombination results showed that the ntd and s2 region of b906zj2019 closely related to ccovi and ccov-ii respectively these results may suggest that b906zj2019 is a recombinant variant between ccovi and ccov-ii in addition the c-domain of b906zj2019 still not well clustered into ccovi and ccov-ii but formed a single clade with a76 which may suggest a second recombination but this still needs further investigation previously study suggested that the distinct c-domain caused a distinct host tropism which differ from the classic ccov strain ccov 171 accession number jq404409 the host tropism of b906zj2019 still needs further study considering the exist of strain a76 this recombination may occur more frequent than we expected furthermore different subtypes ccov co-infection may support this recombination as a typical rna virus with the largest genome cov also presents high level of occurring of mutations 1 we found 37 aa changes in s1 domain and 8 in s2 domain among ccov-iia strains identified here and the classical ccov-iia strains the spike protein is the major antigenicity determinant and also play a vital role in receptor binding and viral entry 49 during virus entry s1 subunit is the major region that binds to host cell surface receptors while s2 is associated with membrane fusion 50 whether these aa changes are related to the receptor binding immunity escaping or other functions still unknown therefore further investigations still need to clarify the specific functions of these non-synonymous substitutions cross-host transmission frequently occurred in animal virus such as porcine circovirus pcv3 51 and pseudorabies virus prv 52 in dna virus influenza a viruses iavs 53 54 55 and coronavirus 756 57 58 in rna virus one of the most notable is coronavirus recently a novel coronavirus called sars-cov-2 emerged in worldwide and was suggested to originate from bats 10 from sars to covid-19 coronaviruses pose a significant threat to public health and cause serious economic loss although there is currently no evidence that coronavirus can cross species barrier from dogs to human it is necessary to monitor the evolution process of canine coronavirus here we investigated the etiology and evolution changes of ccov in china we identified the co-circulating of ccovi ccov-iia and ccov-iib strains but ccov-iia is predominant genotype circulating in china phylogenetic analysis revealed a new subtype ccov-ii variant which includes b906zj2019 a strain identified in this study in addition recombination analysis revealed b906zj2019 may evolve from a recombinant virus of ccovi and ccov-ii in general the resulting data of ccov provide detailed etiological and evolution

response compared to traditional interferon-inducing viruses carolina scagnolari simona trombetti simona cicetti silvia antonelli carla selvaggi lorena perrone michela visca sara romano guido antonelli   severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a newly identified infectious disease and its causative agent has been convincingly identified as a new member of the coronaviridae family called sars-cov 1 one fundamental aspect of the innate immune response against viruses is the secretion of type i interferons ifns which induce cellular mechanisms of resistance against viruses and activate host immune responses 2 the ifns are a large family of multifunctional cytokines involved in the antiviral response regulation of cell growth and activation of the immune system 2 ifn is induced after virus infection especially by rna viruses 2 including the members of the coronaviridae family such as 229e 3 the role of the immune response in general and specifically of ifn in sars-cov pathogenesis has been poorly investigated so far since many viruses evolved specific mechanisms for countering the ifn response 4 the efficiency with which viruses counter the cellular antiviral defense mechanisms is an important contributory factor to viral infection pathogenesis thus it is important to investigate the sars-cov interactions that lead to infection and especially the mechanism by which the host is capable of clearing out the infection in light of the above considerations we planned to investigate the production of ifn type i and ii in response to sars-cov hsr-1 strain infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cell pbmc cultures derived from healthy controls the strain hsr-1 of sars-cov used in this study was obtained by inoculating vero cells with a sputum specimen from an italian patient affected by a severe form of pneumonia of unknown etiology who had a history of travel from vietnam to italy in march 2003 5 pbmcs were chosen to perform the experiments because several studies indicated that sars-cov is able to infect in vitro pbmcs and to determine virus-specific rna production 6 7 8 in order to make a comparison we performed control experiments in which the same cells were induced to produce ifn by vesicular stomatitis vsv and newcastle disease ndv viruses we used these viruses as control because of their high and well-known capacity of ifn induction briefly human pbmcs were isolated from buffy coats of 10 blood donors provided by the blood bank of the sapienza university of rome blood was collected in edta tubes and pbmcs were separated by ficoll-hypaque gradient sedimentation pbmcs 5  106 were plated in 6-well plates falcon 353046 multiwell 6-well becton-dickinson franklin lakes nj usa and infected with 100 l of sars-cov at a moi of 01 in serum-free medium mem sial italy supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine sial italy and 50 gml of gentamycin sial italy after adsorption at 37 for 1 h the excess virus inoculum was removed the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and the wells topped up with medium plus 2 fetal calf serum sial italy to 01 mlwell cells were cultured for 24 and 48 h after infection with sars-cov as stated before control experiments with vsv and ndv at the same moi were carried out for safety precautions all culture supernatants collected 24 and 48 h post-infection pi were uv irradiated for 1 h to inactivate residual infectious virus before ifn induction analysis cells were collected 24 and 48 h after virus infection and were frozen at 80 for ifn- subtype mrna expression analysis see below ifn activity was determined at 24 and 48 h pi evaluating the reduction of cytopathic effect on bovine madin-darby bovine kidney cells by vsv in brief 3  104 cells were seeded into each well of 96-well plates falcon 353072 microtest 96 becton dickinson and incubated with threefold serial dilution of supernatant samples for 18 h at 37 following incubation cells were challenged with vsv at a moi of 05 and the plates were incubated at 37 for 18 h virus-induced cytopathic effects were assessed by microscopic examination the monolayers cell was then stained with crystal violet in 20 ethanol the dye taken up by the cells was eluted with 33 acetic acid and its absorbance measured at 540 nm with an elisa microplate reader ifn concentrations were expressed as inverse dilution that provided 50 of cell protection against viral-induced cytopathic effect figure 1a shows the ifn-inducing capacity of sars-cov hsr-1 strain it can be seen that vsv and ndv induce a higher yield of ifn activity at both 24 and 48 h after infection of pbmcs derived from healthy donors than sars-cov p  005 by students t test next we characterized the antiviral activity in the supernatant of pbmc cultures stimulated with sars-cov by analyzing the ifn- - and - production using different elisa kits human ifn- - elisa kits pbl biomedical laboratories tema ricerca italy assays were carried out as recommended by the manufacturers instructions the results show that sars-cov elicits a significantly lower production of ifn- and - compared to vsv and ndv p  005 by students t test fig 1b c the only exception being the amount of ifn- induced at 24 h by sars-cov which is lower but not significantly than that induced by ndv ifn- levels in supernatant cultures from pbmcs infected with sars-cov show no significant differences compared to those induced by vsv or ndv fig 1d however there was again a trend towards lower production of ifn- in pbmcs infected with sars-cov compared to vsv and ndv in addition we observed higher levels of ifn- in supernatants of pbmcs infected with sars-cov at 24 h than at 48 h whereas ifn- and - levels remained rather stable up to day 2 pi next we investigated the transcriptional induction of the main ifn- subtypes in pbmcs infected with sars-cov by real-time reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr taqman using the abi 7000 sequence detector applied biosystems monza italy briefly total cellular rna was extracted from 5  106 cells using phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate reagent trizol gibco brl grand island ny usa following the manufacturers instructions rna was then reverse transcribed using a high-capacity cdna archive kit applied biosystems next we added the following primer pair and probes for ifn- subtypes 9 to the universal pcr master mix applied biosystems at 300 and 100 nm respectively in a final volume of 50 l the co-amplification of the -glucuronidase gene assay-on-demand hs99999908m1 applied biosystems was used to control the total amount of rna extracted from pbmcs the relative amount of each transcript normalized to -glucuronidase mrna was calculated by using the arithmetic formula 2ct or 2ct according to the suppliers guidelines applied biosystems pbmcs isolated from healthy donors were found to express a low quantity of ifn- subtypes this constitutive expression is variable depending on the examined ifn- subtype specifically the ifn- subtype values in unstimulated pbmcs determined using the equation 2ct according to the suppliers guidelines range between 025 and 156 for the healthy subjects the results also show for the first time to our knowledge that sars-cov in vitro infection of pbmcs leads to the transcriptional induction of several ifn- subtypes and that they are induced to a different extent fig 2a in particular among the subtypes detected at 24 h pi ifn-2 and 6 are the major transcripts followed by ifn-131 and finally ifn-5 8 10 17 and 21 as minor transcribed subtypes the difference between the level of expression of ifn- subtypes 2 6 and 131 measured at 24 h after infection with sars-cov is statistically significant p  005 by students t test all the ifn- subtypes reached much higher levels at 48 h pi than those measured in controls and at 24 h pi p  005 by students t test as expected a significant production of ifn- subtypes in pbmcs infected with vsv or ndv at 24 h as well as at 48 h was observed p  005 by students t test fig 2b c interestingly we found that over a time course of 24 and 48 h of infection lower levels of all of the ifn- subtypes investigated were transcribed in pbmcs infected with sars-cov when compared with those induced by vsv and ndv the ratio values expressed as log values in the ifn- subtype levels between vsv and sars-cov after pbmcs infection were variable the mean value at 24 h was 238 range 193-278 and at 48 h it was 094 range 06-12 the same analysis performed with ndv revealed that mean value at 24 and 48 h were 042 and 053 respectively such findings which are consistent with previous observations 9 support the idea that the expression level of each ifn- subtype is dependent on the kind of viral stimulus to further support the view that sars-cov is a poor inducer of ifn- subtypes and to gain new insights into the phenomenon the increase of all ifn- subtypes was measured in pbmcs collected from 5 healthy donors after transfection with double-stranded rna synthetic analogue such as polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid poly-ic for 24 h the results of these experiments are shown in figure 3 where it can be seen that relevant amounts of different ifn- subtypes can be measured in cells transfected as above this observation indirectly underlines that sars-cov infection of pbmcs was accompanied by a low induction of ifn- mrna subtypes and suggests that toll-like receptor 3 tlr3 together with other pattern recognition receptors could be involved in the signaling leading to expression of type i ifn in pbmcs altogether the data presented in this study along with previous results 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 demonstrate that sars-cov is a weak inducer of ifn- - and - the potential limitations of our study include the fact that we did not compare ifn response in sars-cov-infected pbmcs with those in other relevant human virus in line with this it has been reported that in contrast to human coronavirus 229e and influenza a virus h1n1 there was little or no induction of ifn- in sars-cov-infected macrophages 20 moreover it has been shown that sars-cov infection of primary human macrophages is associated with a strong induction of chemokines without an associate type i ifn response compared to h5n1 infection 21 this finding is consistent with the observation that sars-cov proteins that prevent ifn induction do exist 22 23 24 in particular the expression of nsp1 protein of sars-cov prevents sendai virus-induced endogenous ifn- mrna accumulation without inhibiting dimerization of ifn regulatory factor 3 a protein that is essential for the activation of the ifn- promoter 22 furthermore nsp1 expression promotes degradation of rna transcripts and host endogenous mrnas leading to a stronger host protein synthesis inhibition in addition kopecky-bromberg et al 24 found that sars-cov open reading frame orf 3b orf 6 and n proteins inhibit the expression of irf-3 suggesting that like other highly pathogenic viruses sars-cov genome encodes more than one protein able to inhibit ifn therefore altogether these results may help to explain the rapid rise in virus titers during the initial phase of sars disease in agreement with the above consideration it has been reported that several ifn-stimulated genes such as pkr gbp-12 cxl-1011 and jakstat signal pathway were down-regulated in sars patients with acute severe phase compared to patients with the convalescent phase 11 however in contrast with our results and many other results obtained with in vitro experiments 10 15 16 17 18 19 it has been recently demonstrated that sars-cov induced a wide range of type i ifns and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in the lungs of macaques 25 moreover it has also been reported by okabayashi et al 26 that the ifn system was not suppressed by sars-cov infection the reasons for these discrepancies are still unclear several factors should be taken into account these include differences in i cells types used to investigate sars-cov capability to induce ifn ii methods employed to determine ifn induction iii timing of sample collections for the analysis of ifn induction with respect to sars-cov infections and iv type of virus used to make a comparison with ifn production in sars-cov infection further studies are required to gain a better understanding of the activation of ifn system during sars-cov infection importantly the results of this study also demonstrate that lower levels of all of the ifn- subtypes investigated were transcribed in pbmcs infected with sars-cov in contrast with those induced by vsv and ndv in addition we observed that sars-cov induce a characteristic profile of ifn- subtype production it is generally believed that the transcription of different ifn- subtypes is modulated through multiple signaling pathways depending on the virus and the type of cells infected however the expression and function of ifn- subtypes during infection with highly pathogenic viruses have been poorly investigated interestingly hepatitis c virus hcv infection has been reported to be associated with low ifn-5 mrna levels which is the main ifn- subtype expressed in the liver 27 our results show that ifn-5 mrna production at 24 h pi was lower compared to the other ifn- subtypes investigated when induced with sars-cov too on the contrary the levels of ifn-6 and 2 are higher although it has been reported that ifn-6 is up to 52 times less activated than ifn-2 after infections of pbmcs with either herpes simplex virus or other different viruses of the paramixoviridae family 9 it is well known that different ifn- subtypes possess distinct antiviral and antiproliferative effects both in vitro and in vivo 28 29 30 31 32 it has been reported that ifn-8 has the most potent antiviral activity against murine encephalomyelitis virus in various human cell lines while ifn-1 is the least efficient 33 in agreement koyama et al 34 demonstrated that ifn-8 was the most effective of the ifn- subfamily against intracellular hepatitis c virus replication in light of the above findings the fact that sars-cov induced lower levels of ifn-8 compared to ifn-2 6 and 131 could suggest a scenario in which during sars the virus affect selectively the expression of specific ifn- subtypes with the most biological activity the impaired expression of specific ifn- subtypes caused by sars-cov could contribute to the main immunopathological processes involved in sars a better understanding of sars-cov strategies to alter ifn- subtype expression may elucidate the mechanism underlying virus-induced airway disease in summary our data together with previous results demonstrate that sars-cov hsr-1 strain induces a weak ifn response in comparison with well-established ifn-inducing viruses such as those for vsv and ndv this phenomenon has also been described for murine hepatitis coronavirus which is closely related to sars-cov 14 interestingly our results further indicate that sars-cov-induced activation of the ifn system in human pbmcs is associated with a selective expression of individual ifn- subtypes ifn-2 and 6 being the most abundant subtypes detected at 24 h pi our results will hopefully make a contribution to further studies of sars pathogenesis  immunogenicity and antigenic relationships among spike proteins of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus subtypes g1 and g2 xiaobo wang jianfei chen da shi hongyan shi xin zhang jing yuan shibo jiang li feng   porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is an acute and highly contagious enteric infectious disease characterized by vomiting diarrhea and dehydration in pigs of all ages but especially in newborn piglets 1 2 pedv was first reported in england in 1971 3 and then detected in japan in 1982 and subsequently confirmed in other southeastern asian countries 4 in the usa pedv was first reported in 2013 and has since rapidly spread throughout the country 5 6 in china the incidence of pedv outbreaks has rapidly increased since 2010 especially among newborn piglets aged from a few hours to one week often resulting in death due to watery diarrhea and dehydration 7 8 although the use of inactivated and attenuated vaccines may have helped to reduce the prevalence of disease pedv has continually emerged causing tremendous losses to the swine industry in china 9 pedv a member of the genus alphacoronavirus in the family coronaviridae has a single-stranded positive-sense rna genome of approximately 28 kb encoding four structural proteins the spike s nucleocapsid n envelope e and membrane m proteins 10 11 the s protein is a glycoprotein consisting of 13831387 amino acids aa on the viral surface which is composed of four regions a signal peptide aa 124 an extracellular region a transmembrane domain aa 13341356 and a short cytoplasmic tail aa 13571383 12 unlike other coronaviruses ie murine coronavirus and bovine coronavirus the s protein of pedv cannot be cleaved into s1 and s2 domains after pedv maturation thus the s1 domain residues 1789 and s2 domain aa 7901383 of pedv are artificially defined based on homology to other coronavirus s proteins 13 14 the s protein is responsible for binding and fusion of the virus to the host cells it therefore not only determines cellular tropism but also plays a vital role in inducing production of neutralizing antibodies in the host 15 16 the s gene of pedv is often used to evaluate the genetic diversity of coronaviruses 17 18 based on phylogenetic analysis of the full-length s sequences isolated in china pedvs can be divided into two genotypes g1 and g2 19 furthermore pedv detected in china from 2010 to 2012 were mostly variant strains most belonging to subtype g2 that differed genetically from the cv777 vaccine strain belonging to subtype g1 20 however many pig herds vaccinated with inactivated or attenuated cv777 vaccines still experienced high mortality rates among newborn piglets 17 21 therefore further evaluation of the immunogenicity and antigenic relationships of pedv subtypes g1 and g2 is of vital importance in the present study we expressed the full-length s gene in a eukaryotic expression system prepared anti-s polyclonal antibodies pabs and performed subsequent experiments to investigate differences in antigenicity between the pedv subtypes to determine if mutations in the s gene are the cause of immunization failure the findings of this study also lay a foundation for further study of the function of the s protein and to facilitate development of pabs against pedv the pedv g1 cv777 vaccine strain genbank accession number kt323979 was preserved at harbin veterinary

subtypes shared 902 958  sequence identity with the g2 subtypes the s sequence of strain lnct2 shared 963 988  sequence identity with other g2 subtypes indicating that lnct2 is a typical pedv g2 strain the cv777 vaccine strain shared 923  sequence identity with lnct2 strains with multiple aa mutations table 1

 hek 293t cells in six-well tissue culture plates were transfected with recombinant plasmids paav-cv777 s-flag and paav-lnct2 s-flag containing unoptimized s genes and recombinant plasmids paav-opti cv777 s-flag and paav-opti-lnct2 s-flag containing optimized s genes as the s protein was co-expressed with the hrgep protein the fluorescence intensity reflected the expression level of the s protein we found that the expression levels of the s proteins were significantly increased by codon optimization fig 2a s proteins were detected by western blotting using anti-flag mouse monoclonal antibody mab as the primary antibody the results showed that the recombinant proteins reacted specifically with the primary antibody and each had a molecular weight of 250 kda fig 2b these results were in accordance with those of the sds-page analysis with the purified s protein fig 2c
 specific igg antibodies were detected in serum samples collected at different time points using an indirect elisa as described previously a shown in fig 3 igg antibody levels against the s protein in serum from immunized mice were significantly increased at 14 days post-immunization p  005 and then highly significantly increased at 21 days as compared with mice immunized with pbs p  001 while there were no significant differences in titers of igg antibodies induced by cv777 and lnct2 s proteins at different time points p  005
 the elisa results indicated high cross-reactivity between the pabs and the two types of pedv s protein the titers of anti-s pabs reacting with same subtype s protein reached 1204800 while the titers reacting with different subtype s proteins reached 1102400 as shown in fig 4a and b the od405 values of anti-scv777 protein pabs at different dilutions reacting with the cv777 s protein were much higher than those reacting with the lnct2 s protein
 the ifa results indicated that pedv s protein was present in the cytoplasm of vero e6 cells fig 5a both pedv cv777 and lnct2 could induce obvious cpe vero e6 cell fused with each other and formed syncytia the structure of cells infected by lnct2 was still clear while cv777-infected cells were all fused and no single cellular morphology was generally observed the syncytia of cv777-infected cells were larger than those of lnct2-infected cells fig 5a and b
 the ifa results confirmed that the anti-s pabs cross-reacted with pedv strains cv777 and lnct2 next we detected the fluorescence intensity of the antigenic cross-reaction between the the anti-s protein pabs and the two pedv subtypes consistent with the elisa results which showed twofold differences between different pedv subtypes based on titers of the anti-s pabs the highest titer of anti-s pabs reacting with pedv within subtypes observing green fluorescence reached 151200 while the reaction of anti-s pabs and pedv across subtypes only reached 125600 table 2
 anti-s pabs bound with the pedv s protein which was about 220 kda slightly smaller than the recombinant s protein as was expected the results of the western blot assay demonstrated that the anti-s pabs cross-reacted with strains cv777 and lnct2 fig 6a and b indicating that pedv s proteins had at least one common antigenic epitope across the g1 and g2 strains
 the titers of anti-s pabs neutralizing pedv were calculated by the krber method the average titer of anti-scv777 pab which protected 50  of cv777-infected cells was 1336 while the titer cross-neutralizing lnct2 was 1150 the average titer of anti-slnct2 pabs neutralizing lnct2 reached 1230 while the titer of neutralizing cv777 was 1387 fig 7 the sn titer of anti-scv777 pabs neutralizing cv777 strain was more than twofold higher than those neutralizing the lnct2 strain while the neutralizing titers of anti-slnct2 pabs were less than twofold of those reacting with the two strains
 the ongoing epidemic of pedv has resulted in significant economic losses to the swine industry in asia as well as europe and north america in china mortality due to pedv infection can reach 80 100  in piglets less than 10 days old 25 in the usa pedv infection has resulted in a loss of almost 10  of the domestic pig population after only a 1-year epidemic period 26 located on the surface of pedv the s protein plays an pivotal role in recognizing receptors of target cells thereby inducing production of neutralizing antibodies by activated host immune cells 15 16 although there have been relatively few studies using full-length sequences of the pedv s protein most investigating the immunogenicity of the pedv s protein have focused on the s1 region 2729 as pedv s protein cannot be cleaved into s1 and s2 domains after virus maturation and s2 domain may also have potential neutralizing linear and conformational epitopes the whole s protein with its native conformation might be a better immunogen than the s1 protein previously severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov spike proteins have been shown to produce high-titer antibodies in mice 30 in the present study we successfully expressed and purified the full-length s protein using a eukaryotic expression system western blot analysis confirmed that the s protein was specifically detected by anti-flag antibodies fig 1b the ifa indicated that the s protein was expressed at higher levels in hek 293t cells through codon optimization fig 1a as demonstrated with other coronaviruses 31 the pedv s protein has 2730 potential glycosylation sites that help to maintain its biological function 32 therefore we chose a eukaryotic expression system that was particularly useful for the production of such a large multi-domain protein requiring complex folding machinery and post-translational modifications 33 so that the structure of the s protein was close to the naturally occurring conformation other advantages of choosing a eukaryotic expression system were that the expressed fusion protein was soluble as the biological function was maintained 34 35 in the present study we established a method to express and purify the pedv s protein which can be used not only to evaluate immunogenicity but also to study s protein function the igg levels of mice immunized with the s protein were significantly increased beginning on post-immunization day 14 and antibody titers reached 1204800 on post-immunization day 42 according to the elisa results fig 2 the high igg antibody titers of immunized mice indicated that purified s protein may be a good candidate as an immunogen for pab production and diagnostic methods since 2010 pedv outbreaks in several provinces have caused significant economic losses to the swine industry in china 7 8 although a cv777-inactivated vaccine has been used to immunize swine herds against pedv infection its efficacy has been rather low 8 therefore it is of vital importance to develop a cv777 vaccine that can cross-protect against epidemic strains of the g2 subtype previous studies have found differences in the antigenicity between pedv cv777 and strains isolated in the usa and some pig antibodies and mabs showed 4- to 16-fold differences between the titers of the homologous and heterologous strains ccif and vn as at least one epitope on the n-terminal region of pedvtgev n protein contributed to this cross-reactivity 36 however the mabs used in the previous study were against the n protein which is not the major antigen that induces production of neutralizing antibodies by host cells in our previous study we also found twofold differences in pig antibodies based on sn titers between strains cv7777 and lnct2 data not shown a comparison of sequences of two types of pedv g2 s protein from 14 recent chinese epidemic strains from 2011 to 2015 showed that they had 904 938  sequence identity to the cv777 vaccine strain table 1 and sequence variations were concentrated in the n-terminal region of the s protein due to a point mutation a deletion and an insertion of four amino acids the lnct2 strain we chose belonged to the g2 subtype and its s sequence was 923  identical to that of the cv777 vaccine strain g1 subtype the neutralizing epitope domain coe aa 499638 had eight different amino acids and the epitope motif ss6 764lqdgqvki771 had two aa mutations between the two pedv subtypes 19 based on these differences in s protein sequences we investigated whether mutations in the s protein resulted in a change in antigenicity between strains g1 and g2 the elisa and ifa results showed significant antigenic cross-reactivity between the two pedv subtypes however there was approximately a twofold difference in the antigenic responses based on the titers of the pabs especially the elisa results showed that reactivity of the anti-scv777 pabs at different dilutions with the cv777 s protein was much greater than that with the lnct2 s protein indicating that the ability of anti-scv777 pabs to cross-react with different subtypes was lower than that of the anti-slnct2 pabs in addition previous studies have shown that the pedv cv777 strain induces larger syncytia than korean strain dr13 and three us strains 3638 comparing the ifa results of the cv777 and lnct strains we also found a similar phenomenon fig 7 these results indicated that cv777 and epidemic strains may have differences in their ability to enter cells and induce fusion and may have different effects on cell morphology the results of western blot analysis indicated that the pedv s proteins had at least one common antigenic epitope allowing the s protein pabs to cross-react with different pedv subtypes likewise the results of the sn assay confirmed the presence of high titers of pabs against the s protein that were able to cross-neutralize other pedv subtypes however consistent with the elisa and ifa results there were obvious differences in serum neutralizing responses across subtypes the sn titer of anti-scv777 pabs neutralizing strain cv777 was more than twofold higher than the pabs neutralizing strain lnct while the differences in the neutralizing titers of anti-slnct2 pabs across subtypes was less than twofold these results indicate that the neutralizing epitopes of the lnct2 s protein had changed or that new neutralizing epitopes had emerged due to mutations in the s protein in the subsequent experiments we found that the 5f7 monoclonal antibody against the lnct s protein could react with strain lnct but not strain cv777 data not shown further studies to identify the mab 5f7 epitope are underway in summary the full-length sequence of the pedv s gene was codon-optimized and successfully expressed in hek293t cells the findings of this study confirmed that the recombinant s protein was highly immunogenic in mice and could effectively induce production of antibodies especially neutralizing antibodies furthermore we found significant antigenic relationships between the pedv s protein of subtypes g1 and g2 which indicated that the cv777 vaccine could cross-protect against g2 epidemic strains at least to some extent however the antigenic and serologic neutralization responses against the s protein also reflected antigenic differences of twofold between the two pedv subtypes based on anti-s pabs titers therefore future development of vaccines against emerging pedv strains should involve multiple s proteins containing neutralizing epitopes from both the g1 and g2 subtypes  a novel synonymous mutation of sars-cov-2 is this possible to affect their antigenicity and immunogenicity sung-jae kim van-giap nguyen yong-ho park bong-kyun park hee-chun chung   coronavirus cov is a class of genetically diverse rna viruses found in a wide range of hosts including reptiles birds and mammals most pathogenic covs usually cause respiratory and intestinal symptoms in animals 12345 over the past 20 years a few novel beta-coronaviruses originated from bats have been transmitted to humans and caused severe respiratory syndrome sars-cov and mers-cov were first introduced to humans in 2002 and 2012 respectively 3 recently a new novel beta-coronavirus named sars-cov-2 first broke out in wuhan city china the first case of this virus was reported in december 2019 and this virus has subsequently spread explosively worldwide and severely threatened human health 36 cov is generally composed of four major structural proteins nucleocapsid protein n membrane m envelope e and spike glycoprotein s among these proteins the s glycoprotein plays crucial roles in viral entry and pathogenesis as its widely exposed structure forms large petal-shaped spikes on the surface of the virion 7 mutations in the spike glycoprotein can allow novel coronavirus strains to infect humans and spread pandemically 8 therefore s gene encoding s glycoprotein has widely been used for molecular analysis of coronaviruses due to the significant features of the s glycoprotein affecting the antigenicity and immunogenicity 24910111213  thus far there has been little data comparing and analyzing s gene sequences within sars-cov-2 generally several types of coronavirus are divided into subtypes depending on amino acid mutations in s gene sequences and molecular analysis based on the s gene can provide insights into antigenicity immunogenicity or evolutionary trends 24101213 thus we analyzed the s gene sequences of sars-cov-2 to better understand this virus in this study  for phylogenetic analysis based on the s gene 144 sequences of sars-cov-2 that globally originated from several countries china usa italy spain japan vietnam taiwan and pakistan were retrieved from genbank using iq-tree v1612 14 the genetic relationships between sars-cov-2 were inferred by the maximum likelihood ml method the -m mfp option was invoked to help select the data best-fit amino acid substitution model the branch support values were estimated by ultrafast bootstrap approximation 15 implemented in iq-tree 14 via the -bb 1000 option the reconstructed phylogenies were displayed and midpoint rooted by figtree v143 in the ml tree completely divided clades were identified among the analyzed sars-cov-2 strains figure 1a  interestingly only one reliable synonymous change was found to distinguish between subtypes a and b in this study sars-cov-2a and -2b strains consistently exhibited ala d and gly g at the amino acid sequence position 614 respectively figure 1b the virus consistently evolves to evade the host immune system with synonymous mutations that are so-called positive selection more evolved viruses are better able to survive thus such viruses will likely be dominant within the group 16 sars-cov-2a includes the china strains confirmed in 2019 but sars-cov-2b only includes the usa strains confirmed after 2020 in addition the usa was one of the latest countries to experience a covid-19 outbreak although there was only a few months difference sars-cov-2b may be a more evolved form if the mutation of d614g plays a crucial role in the positive selection process sars-cov-2b will be the dominant type of sars-cov-2 in the future more long-term tracking will be required to validate this assumption the s glycoprotein is important for viral entry and pathogenesis with the most variable sequences in the coronavirus genomes human beta-coronavirus s proteins are cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits by host proteases 17 the s1 subunit forming a globular shape is responsible for receptor binding 18 while the s2 subunit forming a rod shape mediates membrane fusion 19 more specifically the s1 subunit is composed of two major domains s1-ntd and s1-ctd and two sub-domains sd-1 and sd-2 one or both of the major domains is potentially responsible for binding host-receptors and the sub-domains that are complex folding of elements may allow receptor-induced conformational changes 112021 thus mutations within the s1 region are associated with changes in antigenicity and viral pathogenicity 22  in fact the s1 subunit contains numerous major and minor neutralizing antibody epitopes 2123 thus it is difficult to investigate all putative epitopes to discover which can play a crucial role on the antigenicity and immunogenicity of viruses in this situation inferences considering both aspects of virus evolution and epitope analysis can be helpful to investigate which epitopes really play a crucial role b-cell epitopes on the s1 subunit were predicted by bepipred-20 24 the chou  fasman method 25 the kolaskar and tongaonkar method 26 and parkers hydrophilicity 27 regions between amino acids 614 and 621 were equally identified as a b cell epitope by all four methods figure 1c the predicted b-cell epitope including amino acid 614 was located in a relatively well-exposed part of the s1 subunit in the 3d-view structure figure 1d this b-cell epitope sequence was identified within the sequence corresponding to the sd-1-2 domain figure 1e  the antigenic indexes of each amino acid in this region amino acids 613621 were calculated by the jamesonwolf method when an antigen index was 05 it was believed to be a reliable position as an epitope 28 the results of the antigenic index analysis showed severely reduced indexes of amino acids 615617 in the sars-cov-2b strains compared to sars-cov-2a it is predicted that the change of d614g affects the antigenicity of this region figure 1f since no amino acid changes were found in this area other than the change of d614g it is believed that this amino acid change alters the conformation of these immunogenic determinants consequently this region is expected to no longer act as a b-cell epitope in sars-cov-2b b-cell plays a major role in recognizing pathogens and stimulating adaptive immunity in the immune response against virus infection thus the elimination of b cell epitopes will likely reduce immunogenicity by hampering the immune cell recognition of the virus 2930  when reflecting the above results sars-cov-2b may have reduced immunogenicity compared to sars-cov-2a if so it can permit persistent or recurrent infection of sars-cov-2b while evading immune cell recognition in addition the mutation of the s1 domain may induce different antigenicity and viral pathogenicity between the two subtypes different virus subtypes will likely have somewhat different serological features depending on their antigenicity although there may be some cross-reactivity in addition a certain subtype can serologically cover other serotypes 1231 thus this point should be considered to create a new sars-cov-2 vaccine indeed if the two serotypes have different serological characteristics a vaccine that includes both subtypes will be more effective at preventing covid-19 particularly when developing a killed vaccine that has a narrow protection range compared to a live vaccine this study was confined to investigating the phylogenetic and genetic features of sars-cov-2 due to limited information therefore further study on the cross-reactivity between these two subtypes is required to validate our assumption viruses have continually evolved through genetic mutations to evade host immune systems in the long history of the fight between humans and viruses sars-cov-2 which has only recently been introduced in humans will continue to evolve for survival in the current situation in which this virus has already become a pandemic to respond properly against this virus continuous surveillance of this virus adaptation to evade host immune systems is important in the future   genetic grouping of sars-cov-2 coronavirus sequences using informative subtype markers for pandemic spread visualization we propose an efficient framework for genetic subtyping of sars-cov-2 the novel coronavirus that causes the covid-19 pandemic efficient viral subtyping enables visualization and modeling of the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of disease spread subtyping thereby advances the development of effective containment strategies and potentially therapeutic and vaccine strategies however identifying viral subtypes in real-time is challenging sars-cov-2 is a novel virus and the pandemic is rapidly expanding viral subtypes may be difficult to detect due to rapid evolution founder effects are more significant than selection pressure and the clustering threshold for subtyping is not standardized we propose to identify mutational signatures of available sars-cov-2 sequences using a population-based approach an entropy measure followed by frequency analysis these signatures informative subtype markers isms define a compact set of nucleotide sites that characterize the most variable and thus most informative positions in the viral genomes sequenced from different individuals through ism compression we find that certain distant nucleotide variants covary including non-coding and orf1ab sites covarying with the d614g spike protein mutation which has become increasingly prevalent as the pandemic has spread isms are also useful for downstream analyses such as spatiotemporal visualization of viral dynamics by analyzing sequence data available in the gisaid database we validate the utility of ism-based subtyping by comparing spatiotemporal analyses using isms to epidemiological studies of viral transmission in asia europe and the united states in addition we show the relationship of isms to phylogenetic reconstructions of sars-cov-2 evolution and therefore isms can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis such as is done in the nextstrain 1 project the developed pipeline dynamically generates isms for newly added sars-cov-2 sequences and updates the visualization of pandemic spatiotemporal dynamics and is available on github at httpsgithubcomeesiism and via an interactive website at httpscovid19-ismcoedrexeledu author summary the novel coronavirus responsible for covid-19 sars-cov-2 expanded to reportedly 87 million confirmed cases worldwide by june 21 2020 the global sars-cov-2 pandemic highlights the importance of tracking viral transmission dynamics in real-time through june 2020 researchers have obtained genetic sequences of sars-cov-2 from over 47000 samples from infected individuals worldwide since the virus readily mutates each sequence of an infected individual contains useful information linked to the individuals exposure location and sample date but there are over 30000 bases in the full sars-cov-2 genomeso tracking genetic variants on a whole-sequence basis becomes unwieldy we describe a method to instead efficiently identify and label genetic variants or subtypes of sars-cov-2 applying this method results in a compact 11 base-long compressed label called an informative subtype marker or ism we define viral subtypes for each ism and show how regional distribution of subtypes track the progress of the pandemic major findings include 1 covarying nucleotides with the spike protein which has spread rapidly and 2 tracking emergence of a local subtype across the united states connected to asia and distinct from the outbreak in new york which is

cryptosporidium parvum a well-known protozoan intestinal parasite of the phylum apicomplexa causes enteric diseases in domestic ruminants and humans c parvum is strongly associated with diarrhea in neonatal calves 1 a report mentioned that the prevalence of this parasite reached 75 in pre-weaned calves in japan 2 diarrhea is a complex and multifactorial disease symptom influenced by the nutritional and immunological status of a calf the management of the herd the environment and various infectious agents 3 co-infection with multiple pathogens may increase diarrhea severity and mortality rates in addition to c parvum rotavirus bovine coronavirus and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli e coli k99 are well-known enteropathogens associated with neonatal diarrhea in calves throughout the world 4 5 6 however investigations to identify the multiple causative agents of diarrhea in calves have not been performed yet in japan therefore one of the aims of the present study was to determine the prevalence of the four major causative agents associated with clinical diarrheal cases in pre-weaned calves through use of commercial immunochromatography test ict strips traditionally c parvum has been diagnosed by microscopy of fecal samples following sample concentration by the sugar floatation method however c parvum cannot be differentiated from c bovis and c ryanae using microscopy because their oocysts are of similar size and morphology 7 c bovis and c ryanae have been detected exclusively from cattle and infections with the two species are most likely asymptomatic 8 it is therefore important to accurately distinguish those species from c parvum recently the nucleotide sequences obtained from nested polymerase chain reactions pcrs of the small subunit ribosomal rna ssurrna and glycoprotein 60 gp60 genes have been employed as tools for accurate species identification and subtyping analysis respectively 9 10 11 12 13 although some epidemiological studies on c parvum in japan have been performed using these dna markers 14 15 16 17 they did not characterize the c parvum populations from more than one region of the country therefore the aim of the present study was not only to obtain epidemiological information about c parvum based on ssurrna and gp60 gene sequences but also to compare the characteristics of this parasite in two different japanese prefectures southernmost okinawa and northernmost hokkaido sampling location information is summarized in fig 1
 we collected 50 diarrheic samples from calves aged from 6 to 88 days from 29 farms located on three islands in okinawa prefecture japan from december 2012 to january 2013 one to seven samples were collected from each farm and the fecal properties of the samples were recorded commercial ict strips bio-x diagnostics sprl jemelle belgium were used to detect c parvum rotavirus coronavirus and e coli k99 antigens in the diarrhea samples table 1
 twenty-five diarrheic samples were also collected from calves aged from 4 to 21 days in hokkaido prefecture japan from december 2012 to may 2013 one to five samples were collected from 11 farms table 2
 these samples tested positive for c parvum antigen using ict strips and molecular characterizations were performed to compare those with c parvum from okinawa prefecture rotavirus coronavirus and e coli k99 were not investigated for the samples from hokkaido prefecture all the fecal samples were stored at 4 c and transported to laboratories for further analyses the centrifugal sugar flotation method was used to detect cryptosporidium and other parasitic oocysts andor eggs that might cause diarrhea floatation was performed after suspending 1 g of a diarrheal sample in sucrose solution 12 gml thereby allowing the approximate number of oocysts per gram opg to be calculated the average number of oocysts for 10 fields at a magnification of 400 was calculated and the average number was converted into opg by using the total number of fields under the microscope opg values were compared between c parvum single infections and mixed infections with rotavirus using a students t-test correlations between the fecal properties and the pathogens were evaluated for c parvum-associated and non-associated diarrhea using fishers exact test total dna was extracted using a qiaamp dna stool mini kit qiagen hilden germany according to the manufacturers protocol before dna extraction 02 g of each fecal sample was transferred to a 15 ml plastic tube and three cycles of freezingthawing were performed quick freezing was performed in a  80 c freezer for 15 min while quick thawing was conducted in a 37 c water bath for 15 min thereafter ssurrna and gp60 genes were amplified by nested pcr a previously described primer set 9 was used for nested pcr to amplify the ssurrna gene for the gp60 gene gp60 nested 1st f 5-atg caa aaa tac gtg gac tgg gt-3 and gp60 nested 1st r 5-tcg cac gaa aga ttt cca ttg-3 primers were used for the first round of pcr followed by gp60 nested 2nd orff 5-atg aga ttg tcg ctc att atc gta t-3 and gp60 nested 2nd orfr 5-tta caa cac gaa taa ggc tgc aaa g-3 primers for the second pcr round outer pcr was performed in a 25 l volume with 2 l of template dna 125 l of 2  gflex pcr buffer takara shiga japan mg2  dntp plus 013 l of each primer 10 m and 125 u of tks gflex dna polymerase takara using the geneamp pcr system 2700 applied biosystems foster city usa thermal cycling consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94 c for 1 min followed by 35 cycles at 98 c for 10 s 55 c for 15 s and 68 c for 30 s with a final extension at 68 c for 7 min inner pcrs were performed using the same conditions with 2 l of the first pcr amplification mixture as the template after 10-fold dilution in double-distilled water inner pcr amplicons were purified with the nucleospin gel and pcr clean-up kit macherey-nagel dren germany according to the manufacturers instructions followed by direct sequencing from both directions using a bigdye terminator v31 cycle sequencing kit applied biosystems the resultant sequence ladders were determined using a 3500-genetic analyzer applied biosystems the ssurrna nucleotide sequences were compared with c parvum genbank reference sequences for accurate species identification a neighbor-joining phylogram inferred from the gp60 sequences was constructed by paup version 40b10 18 in the phylogram construction the gp60 sequences obtained in this study along with the c parvum reference sequences were used bootstrap analyses were conducted using 1000 replicates for the 50 diarrheal samples from okinawa 25 500 were c parvum antigen-positive 14 280 were rotavirus antigen-positive one 23 was coronavirus-positive and two 47 were e coli k99 antigen-positive eight samples were positive for both c parvum and rotavirus and one was positive for both c parvum and coronavirus the properties of the diarrheal samples are summarized in fig 2

 among the samples from okinawa the opg values ranged from 12 to 45  104 cryptosporidium oocysts were not found in seven of the samples although they were positive for c parvum antigen ishigakijima island table 1 no significant difference was observed in opg values between c parvum single infections and mixed infections with rotavirus fig 3
 eimeria spp oocysts were detected in three calves from okinawa table 1 ssurrna and gp60 genes were analyzed for accurate species identification and for subtyping analysis respectively and pcr amplicons were obtained from 29 and 20 samples in the both targeting regions table 2 the ssurrna gene was amplified in one sample from ishigakijima island two samples from iriomotejima island and one sample with no location data even though all were negative for c parvum antigen in contrast gp60 gene was not amplifiable from three ishigakijima island samples despite being positive for c parvum antigen surprisingly we could not obtain a gp60 amplicon from one sample from kuroshima island and another sample with no location data although both were c parvum antigen- and oocyst-positive however the two dna target sequences were successfully amplified from the 25 samples from hokkaido table 2 the nucleotide sequences of all the 786-bp ssurrna pcr amplicons from the two prefectures were identical to that of the c parvum sequence deposited in genbank accession no ab746195 the nucleotide sequences of all the gp60 pcr amplicons 925bp were also identical to each other and shared 100 similarity values with the iiaa15g2r1 subtype sequence deposited in genbank fig 4
 nucleotide sequences representative of the ssurrna and gp60 genes have been deposited in genbank under accession nos ab968045 to ab968048ab968045ab968046ab968047ab968048 this study is the first attempt in japan to detect the causative agents of diarrhea in pre-weaned calves using commercial ict strips among the diarrhea samples from okinawa the c parvum antigen showed the highest frequency 50 a previous study performed in hokkaido reported that the prevalence of c parvum reached 75 in pre-weaned calves 2 in contrast the previously reported prevalence rates for rotavirus in japan were 96 19 and 52 20 further investigations on diarrhea cases from different locations in japan may reveal the major pathogens involved in calf diarrhea more clearly the present study revealed that the diarrhea cases associated with c parvum tended to have watery diarrhea table 3 watery diarrhea causes severe dehydration in neonatal calves which in turn may lead to a significant economic loss in cattle industry our study did not reveal any significant difference in the opg values between single infections of c parvum and mixed infections with another diarrhea-causing agent however the number of co-infections observed was insufficient to draw any conclusions about the effect that more than one pathogenic organism might have on the opg values hence continuous sampling from clinical cases of calf diarrhea is needed to obtain more accurate opg calculations to evaluate whether any correlations between c parvum oocyst numbers and the presence or absence of other pathogens exist in this study the nested ssurrna gene appeared to be the more efficient of the two pcr tests at detecting c parvum the ssurrna gene was probably amplified efficiently because it is a multicopy gene whereas gp60 is a single locus gene 21 the ict strip readily detected c parvum antigen however our results suggest that there is a risk of misdiagnosis when this test strip alone is used to detect c parvum the gp60 nested pcr did not seem to always be effective at diagnosing c parvum because we were unable to obtain amplicons from two of the okinawa samples despite them being c parvum antigen- and oocyst-positive according to microscopic observations therefore the results of this study suggest that it is better to use more than one method to reliably detect c parvum many c parvum subtypes are categorized as the iia subtype family on the basis of their worldwide gp60 sequences 11 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 interestingly the gp60 nucleotide sequences detected from the two different locations were identical to each other and were classified as the iiaa15g2r1 subtype furthermore previous analyses of the gp60 subtype of c parvum from gifu kobe hokkaido and the most recent epidemiological study performed in the ishikari district of hokkaido also reported the occurrence of the iiaa15g2r1 subtype alone 14 17 37 these findings suggest that c parvum with the iiaa15g2r1 subtype is predominant in japan because iiaa15g2r1 is a zoonotic subtype 10 cryptosporidiosis control in japan is important for the health of domestic ruminants and humans alike the authors declare that there are no competing interests  molecular diversity of alphacoronavirus 1 in dogs and cats in colombia nf santana-clavijo dp reyes romero df arango fajardo a velandia muoz sa taniwaki so de souza silva pe brando

percent of acute respiratory infections are viral ones nitsch-osuch et al 2015 the multiplex rt-pcr method is a highly sensitive alternative to other diagnostic procedures templeton et al 2004 it saves time and reagents necessary to test samples for the presence of genetic material of respiratory viruses which also expedites the introduction of proper treatment stefaska et al 2012 the methods enables to detect several co-infecting contagions during a single test the most common respiratory viruses are influenza virus type a and b respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenza viruses type 1 2 3 and human rhinovirus human metapneumovirus adenovirus and human coronavirus do et al 2011 influenza is a disease which due to its constant evolution causes persistent epidemics and less frequently pandemics brydak 2014 co-infections with influenza viruses may induce re-assortment between the viruses leading to a more pathogenic subtype liu et al 2010 in particular co-infections with different subtypes of influenza a virus constitute a likely source of reassortants that can acquire unpredictable properties pajak et al 2011 a sectional structure of the influenza virus genome brings about the variation of genotype and phenotype of the virus when the host cell is infected with more than one strain viruses equipped with a new set of genes may appear considering the essential role of co-infections in spread and severity of the disease the goal of this study was to determine the frequency and a crisscross pattern of co-infections with influenza and influenza-like viruses the study

 concerning the regional distribution of co-infections most of those caused by another influenza virus were observed in the provinces of mazovia 39 cases and lesser-poland 25 cases co-infections with more than one influenza virus were noted in sub-carpathian 3 cases lower-silesia 2 cases and single cases in kuyavian-pomeranian silesia and lublin provinces table 3
 co-infections of subtype ah1n1pdm09 with ah1n1 subtype ah1n1pdm09 with ah3n2 and ah1n1 with influenza b virus were confirmed only in the province of mazovia 4 2 1 cases respectively co-infections of subtype ah1n1pdm09 with influenza b virus were reported in mazovia 8 cases sub-carpathian lesser-poland in 2 cases lower-silesia kuyavian-pomeranian and lublin provinces 1 case each the most frequently confirmed co-infection was a combination of infection with influenza virus type a and b with the most cases reported in mazovia 25 and lesser-poland province 23 moreover in sub-carpathian silesia and lower-silesia provinces one case was confirmed per each region table 3 the 20152016 epidemic season was dominated by co-infections of unsubtyped influenza a and b virus 51 cases reported among people from 1 to 84 years of age there were also 15 cases of subtype ah1n1pdm09 and influenza virus type b co-infections moreover there were detected single cases of co-infections of subtype ah1n1 with influenza virus type b 65 years of age and of subtype ah1n1pdm09 with ah3n2 63 and 5 years of age there also were four confirmed cases of co-infections between subtypes ah1n1pdm09 and ah1n1 among children up to 4 years of age and adults above 46 years of age co-infections of influenza viruses with influenza-like viruses and co-infections among influenza-like viruses were reported only in children up to 11 years of age here the following co-infection were detected subtype ah1n1pdm09 with influenza type b virus hmpv and rsv 15 years of age there were also four cases of co-infections with three respiratory viruses three cases of co-infections with subtype ah1n1pdm09 and rsv and rv ab and one case of co-infection with subtype ah1n1pdm09 influenza type b virus and hcov oc43 table 2 in the 20152016 epidemic season there was a higher number of confirmed co-infections with influenza and respiratory influenza-like viruses compared with previous seasons in the 20122013 season co-infections were as follows ten of subtype ah1n1pdm09 with ah3n2 and 8 of ah3n2 with type b virus czarkowski et al 2014 in the 20132014 season co-infections were as follows two of subtype ah1n1pdm09 with ah3n2 seven of influenza with influenza-like viruses two of influenza type a virus rsv a virus and rv ab virus in one-day old and one-month-old children each and three of influenza-like viruses bednarska et al 2015 in the 20142015 season in a framework of the i-move influenza monitoring of vaccine effectiveness program the following co-infections were detected seven of subtype ah1n1pdm09 with type b virus and eight of subtype ah3n2 with type b virus in that last season in addition one co-infection of influenza viruses and four of influenza viruses with influenza-like viruses were noted in children under 14 years of age hallmann-szeliska et al 2016 a significant increase in the number of infections with more than one respiratory virus in the 20152016 season could be associated with a higher number of samples tested 8542 samples compared with the two preceding seasons 2479 and 2416 samples respectively bednarska et al 2016 bednarska et al 2015 nonetheless influenza viruses constantly evolve undergoing antigenic changes which provides them the ability to elude the host immune response system webster et al 2013  comparison of the biofire filmarray respiratory panel seegene anyplexii rv16 and argene for the detection of respiratory viruses maurice chan seok koo hwee boran jiang pei lim qi thean tan yen   respiratory infections are one of the most common reasons for hospital admission 12 identification of the causative agent is often omitted or limited to a few pathogens easily detectable by direct antigen tests 2 however the reliable diagnosis of respiratory infection is important for therapy 3 implementation of isolation measures 4 and better use of antimicrobial therapy 5 epidemiological data from the laboratory can be used for prescribing prophylactic treatments for at risk patients 67 or for alerting to new or seasonal spread of pathogens 2 direct fluorescent antibody testing and viral culture are time consuming and demand significant expertise in the performance of the test and interpretation of test results on the other hand rapid antigen testing appeared to lack sensitivity in the detection of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus rsv with reported sensitivities as low as 21 and 59 respectively 8 9 10 nucleic acid detection tests for respiratory virus assays have gained popularity due to their quick turn-around-time and propensity for multiplexing and automation the fda cleared four molecular multiplex respiratory panels namely the filmarray rp respiratory panel biofire diagnostics salt lake city ut the esensor rvp respiratory viral panel genmark dx carlsbad ca the luminex xtag rvpv1 and the luminex xtag rvp fast luminex molecular diagnostics austin tx these platforms are able to detect 1220 targets simultaneously at reported sensitivities and specificities of 788954 and 990 respectively 3 the filmarray rp fa-rp is the most automated requiring no pre-extraction and additionally tests for three bacterial agents not detected by the other three platforms namely bordetella pertussis chlamydophila pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae the fa-rp is a melt curve-based real-time pcr rt-pcr method whereby the amplification occurs in two steps the 1 st step is to enrich for the target nucleic acids in the sample in a multiplex reaction and the 2nd step is to amplify each target in multiple miniaturized individual wells containing single specific primer-pairs the nucleic acid extraction distribution of nucleic acid into wells and pcr amplification are fully automated and integrated and occur in a single-use pouch the anyplexii rv16 seegene south korea is an alternative to fda-approved integrated platforms it requires pre-extraction and pre-reverse transcription but runs on common rt-pcr platforms such as cfx-96 bio-rad hercules ca and ab7500 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma it utilizes proprietary toce technologies to achieve simultaneous detection of melt curves from 16 viral targets in two-tube reactions the argene real-time pcr assayrespiratory range biomerieux france is compatible with major extraction platforms and real-time pcr systems as well as on various sample types the argene pcr kits have been validated to exhibit good analytical sensitivity and specificity thus represent a rapid and reliable test for the detection of viruses and bacteria causing respiratory infections the turn-around time for the assays not including extraction is within 2 h the objective of this study was to compare the clinical performance using actual clinical respiratory samples of the two multiplexing strategies represented by the fa-rp version 17 and anyplexii rv16 version 11 with that from a more conventional two-plex rt-pcr kit represented by respiratory virus assays from the argene biomerieux france range the research study protocol was submitted to the singhealth centralised institutional review board cirb ref no 20152930 and was exempted from review based on the nature of the study a total of 224 specimens which comprised 189 nasopharyngeal swab specimens in universal transport medium utm copan italy and 35 endotracheal aspirate ett specimens were collected from symptomatic patients from august 2015 to march 2016 the first 107 study specimens were collected prospectively in sequential order and the remaining 117 specimens comprised fa-rp positive universal transport medium utm specimens and respiratory aspirates positive and negative specimens the distribution of microorganisms detected in the samples used for this study is shown in supplemental table 1 the fa-rp anyplexii rv16 and argene assays comprising adenovirusbocavirus coronaviruspiv influenza ainfluenzab rsvmpv and rhinovirusenterovirus were highly similar in their targets bocavirus and the fa-rp bacterial targets b pertussis c pneumoniae and m pneumoniae were not compared as bocavirus was not covered in fa-rp and the bacterial agents were not covered in anyplexii rv16 and argene coronavirus nl63 oc43 khu1 229e and parainfluenza piv1 piv2 piv3 piv4 can be detected by argene kit but cannot be subtyped and were reported as groups fa-rp can detect and subtype four coronavirus subtypes 229e hku1 oc43 and nl63 while anyplexii rv16 covered and subtype three 229e oc43 and nl63 influenza a was not subtyped by anyplexii rv16 and argene rhinovirusenterovirus and rsv were reported as groups by both fa-rp and argene in contrast anyplexii rv16 distinguished between rhinovirus and enterovirus and could subtype rsv into rsv a and rsv b quality control assay validation and result interpretation were performed according to individual manufacturers instructions for anyplexii rv16 and argene microbial nucleic acids were extracted using the ez1 virus mini kit qiagen singapore on ez1 or ez1xl qiagen singapore automated sample preparation platforms sample extraction volume 400 l elution volume 150 l the fa performs extraction and nucleic acid amplification on the same platform utm samples were used directly for fa-rp or for ez1ez1xl extraction other respiratory aspirates underwent pre-processing using a dunk and swirl method in utm 11 prior to nucleic acid extraction briefly the sputum samples were diluted and mixed with an equal volume of sterile water a sterile swab was then dunked into each sample withdrawn and then swirled in 700 l of sterile water the swab was removed and solution used for testing anyplexii rv16 and argene rt-pcr runs were carried out using cfx-96 bio-rad and rotorgene qiagen respectively the fa-rp automatically interpreted and showed the results for each target detected not detected invalid for fa-rp influenza a results which were equivocal or no subtype the specimens were further tested by an in-house influenza ab multiplex qpcr assay which can detect prevalent influenza a virus all subtypes influenza a virus h1n1pdm09 subtype and influenza b virus samples which were equivocal or no subtype by fa-rp were confirmed by argene or anyplexii as true positives but with a low viral load the in-house pcr assay was used as an extended reference test for fa-rp for equivocal or no subtype samples for argene assays a cycle threshold of 40 denotes the presence of the target organism in the sample according to manufacturers instructions for anyplexii rv16 assay melting curve was called for positive or negative results according to kit instruction for all three platforms only results from valid runs were used for calculations in this comparison study an approach of extended composite reference was used for the interpretation of results that is a true positive was defined as being positive by two or more of the three platforms compared to facilitate comparison for cases where targets were reported as a group identification to correct group would be considered as a concordant case when compared with another assay that may provide more a specific identification for example detection of influenza a by anyplexii rv16 and argene and the detection of influenza ah1-2009 by filmarray for the same specimen would be considered as a concordant result results from multiple-positive samples were grouped into respective targets for sensitivity and specificity calculations the performance of fa-rp method on different sample types utm vs ett in terms of sensitivity and specificity was evaluated this was accomplished by comparing the results obtained using fa-rp against those from the composite gold standard between the two sample types a concordance in results between fa-rp and composite gold standard ie both positive and both negative was considered a match two-tailed fishers exact test was used to assess for any significant difference in the correct diagnosis using fa-rp method with composite gold standard as reference between the two sample types a p-value of less than 005 was considered statistically significant the first 107 specimens were prospectively collected in sequential order reflecting the actual clinical distribution of samples sent to the laboratory 38 specimens 365 were positive by fa-rp the most common viruses detected were human rhinovirusenterovirus 125 influenza a  b 87 and rsv 77 there were 2 samples detected with dual-infection 187 subsequent to the first 107 specimens the samples were collected selectively with the purpose of selection of additional positive targets for comparative testing as such the final collection comprised 607 136 positive samples representing all targets covered by fa-rp except influenza h1 only one positive specimen was collected for coronavirus 229e parainfluenza virus 4 piv4 all other targets were represented by 320 samples supplemental table 1 there were 11 specimens which were positive for 2 targets and a single specimen positive for 3 targets there were 28 influenza specimens in this study covering all categories of influenza a results except the h1 subtype category the overall performance of all three platforms was comparable with sensitivities and specificities ranging from 958 to 979 and from 961 to 980 respectively the discordant rates for fa-rp argene and anyplexii rv16 were also similar 51 58 and 51 respectively discordant cases were randomized across the targets with no prominent shortcoming specifically associated with any of the platforms tested table 1
 among the three platforms argene had the most false-negatives and was associated with the lowest sensitivity but the highest specificity while the fa-rp was associated with the highest sensitivity but lowest specificity table 1 the differences were not statistically different at p  005 the specificities for the individual assays were 990 for all the three platforms table 1 for fa-rp the lowest sensitivity was for detection of adenovirus 923 for argene the lowest sensitivity was for detection of rhinoenterovirus and rsv both 889 anyplexii rv16 had the lowest sensitivity 920 for influenza a there were two dual-positive samples in the sequentially collected samples 19 and 11 103 dual-positive samples in the entire test panel one discordant case was observed cov and rsv by fa-rp cov by argene and anyplexii rv16 suggesting that dual positive samples can be diagnosed accurately using fa-rp argene and anyplexii rv16 there were 7 specimens that represented influenza a no sub-type or equivocal results as reported by fa-rp these samples were tested using the comparator platforms and further compared with an in-house qpcr test which tested for the presence of influenza ah1-2009influenza b all three no sub-type samples were influenza a positive by argene ct-values of 2631 anyplexii rv16 and in-house tests ct-values of 2833 the ct-values for argene and in-house test were comparable all four equivocal samples were influenza a positive by argene but in-house test and anyplexii rv16 were negative for two of the samples these two influenza a equivocal samples were considered to be positive by fa-rp all the equivocal samples had ct-values of 30 this suggests that equivocal samples may be weak positive samples and that no-subtype samples may also be moderate-to-weak positive samples among the utm samples 124 out of 126 samples which were tested positive by fa-rp turned out to be positive on composite gold standard 62 out of 63 samples which were tested negative by fa-rp turned out to be negative on composite gold standard hence according to the definition there were three discordant resultstwo false positives and one false negative for utm samples this translated to 992 sensitivity and 969 specificity of the fa-rp method using utm samples among the ett samples 9 out 10 samples which were tested positive by fa-rp turned out to be positive on composite gold standard 24 out of 25 samples which were tested negative by fa-rp turned out to be negative on composite gold standard hence there were two discordant resultsone false positive and one false negative for ett samples this translated to 90 sensitivity and 952 specificity of the fa-rp method using ett samples the statistical analysis showed that 984 of utm versus 943 of ett samples were correctly classified the percentage difference of 41 was not statistically significant p   0175 fishers exact test a wide range of diagnostic kits for respiratory pathogens have emerged addressing both american fda-approved and european ce-ivd markets these kits vary widely in terms of extensiveness of target coverage throughput and degree of automation among non-fda approved platforms the respifinder pathofinder seeplex rv15 seegene magicplex rv panel seegene clart pneumovir genomica and resplex ii panel qiagen have been compared extensively with reported sensitivities ranging from as low as 562 to 916 albeit with excellent specificities 94 for all pathogens 2 among the fda-approved platforms the performance of the fa-rp luminex xtag rvp luminex xtag rvp fast and esensor rvp have been investigated 3 sensitivities ranged from 844 luminex xtag rvp fast to 983 esensor rvp while specificities were high for all assays 99 3 fa-rp had an overall sensitivity of 845 with substantially lower sensitivity noted for detection of adenovirus 3there are comparatively fewer evaluations of anyplexii rv16 but in a comparative study in 2013 the assay was reported to have an overall sensitivity of 952 12 in this comparative study the fa-rp anyplexii rv16 and argene assays were noted to have comparable sensitivities and specificities of 979 and 961 972 and 971 and 958 and 980 respectively in a comparison study between anyplexii rv16 seeplex rv15 seegene and xtag rvp the overall sensitivity of rv16 was better than that of xtag rvp 12 however improvement of the sensitivity for rhinovirus was required 12 in this study fa-rp and anyplexii rv16 had the same sensitivity 962 for rhinovirusenterovirus better than that for argene 926 hence the lack of sensitivity towards rhinovirus previously reported was not observed in this study the sensitivity of fa-rp to adenovirus had been a concern because the original version v16 of this kit was not able to detect several adv serotypes 13 in the modified version v17 the sensitivity improved from 666 to 905 in retrospective studies and 427 to 833 in prospective studies 13 however there was still one serotype serotype 31 that remained undetected in v17 and the performance for adenovirus testing was still lower when compared to an in-house assay 14 in this study the sensitivity of fa-rp v17 for adv was 923 comparable to that reported earlier 13 respiratory aspirates are of specific interest for the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia however the fa-rp is fda-cleared only for testing on nasopharyngeal swab specimens transported in utm in contrast respiratory aspirates were considered acceptable samples for argene and anyplexii rv16 both of which are ce-ivd two previous studies evaluating the fa-rp on a large number of bronchoalveolar lavage bal specimens supported the utility of respiratory aspirates for fa-rp 1516 in this study there was no final run-qc failure associated with the use of respiratory aspirates on the fa-rp furthermore there was no significant difference in the percentage of matches comparing fa-rp with composite gold standard between utm and ett sample types hence this and earlier studies suggest that respiratory aspirates are acceptable sample types for fa-rp there were 78 samples for adv influenza b and rsv all other targets were represented by sample sizes ranging from 10-21 although more samples for adv influenza b and rsv are desired collection period will be prolonged similarly more influenza a equivocal and no-subtype samples will be desirable similarly most of the respiratory aspirates were ett while sputum and bal were poorly represented or not represented at all there were only one each of piv4 coronavirus 229e and 3-targets positive samples hence these categories were not well represented another shortcoming was the use of positive by at least two platforms as the reference result for calculating sensitivity and specificity hence an assay with greater sensitivity than all other assays tested would result in reduced specificity finally all the platforms compared herein were multiplexed assays the argene duplex-assays were the closest to conventional qpcr assays ideally each target should be compared with individual qpcr assays but this was not practical due to the lack of laboratory developed tests ldts for every target as well as financial constraints one shortcoming of the filmarray is that despite its short turnaround time 1 h only one sample could be processed per run while most platforms have higher sample throughput up to 96 samples despite a longer turnaround time 55 h for xtag 275 h for xtag fast 092 h for esensor and 7 h for anyplexii rv16 312 anyplexii and argene are thus of higher throughput and geared towards batched testing while the low complexity filmarray is more suited for on-demand analysis and requires minimum hands-on time since the filmarray performed comparably to anyplexii the laboratorys required turnover and workflow considerations would be major determinants in the selection of a platform for screening respiratory agents it should also be noted that the filmarray also had the highest reagent costs among these automated platforms 3 it is worth noting that the three chosen technologies employed in this study were designed for very different laboratory purposes the biofire system is regarding its workflow clearly suitable for emergency or point of care testing with an excellent time to result the seegene anyplexii or the alternative allplex in one-step rt-pcr fits well with routine activity involving batched samples for testing on a daily basis the argene solution offers quite similar features with the added advantage that the test panel may be adapted with a focus on particular organisms such as influenzae or rsv during the epidemic period depending on the ongoing epidemiology of respiratory infections we have demonstrated the comparable clinical performance of three commercial kits for respiratory viral detection namely filmarray respiratory panel rp anyplexii rv16 and argene using archived clinical respiratory samples based on common overlapping targets across the platforms a more extensive study with larger sample size representative of the different viral categories is required to evaluate the platforms performance at higher resolution the authors declare no conflict of interest  simultaneous typing and hana subtyping of influenza a and b viruses including the pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 by multiplex real-time rt-pcr yaowu yang richard gonzalez fang huang wei wang yongjun li guy vernet jianwei wang qi jin   in april 2009 outbreaks of influenza-like illnesses caused by a novel influenza a virus pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 also referred to as swine-origin influenza virus s-oiv were identified in mexico and the united states cdc 2009 dawood et al 2009 these outbreaks have led to a global influenza pandemic brownstein et al 2009 recent surveillance data show that the pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 is co-circulating with seasonal influenza viruses in many countries httpwwwcdcgovfluweeklypdfexternalf0939pdf httpwwwwhointcsrdon20091023enindexhtml because pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 and seasonal influenza transmit in a similar manner and present almost identical symptoms httpwwwcdcgovh1n1fluqahtm the control and prevention of this novel pandemic has been challenging critical for viral containment surveillance and treatment is the development of sensitive accurate and reliable diagnostic tests that can discriminate the h1n1 influenza virus from other strains among the current laboratory diagnostic tests real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr which determines virus copies by monitoring the fluorescence accumulations has many advantages over other detection techniques these include ease of performance great accuracy high sensitivity and specificity fast turn-around time a high-throughput capacity and minimal carry-over contamination mackay et al 2002 however rrt-pcr assays for subtyping seasonal influenza viruses daum et al 2007 have not been suitable for the detection of pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 because of genetic variations several rrt-pcr assays have been developed recently to detect the pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 carr et al 2009 hall et al 2009 jiang et al 2010 pabbaraju et al 2009 wang et al 2009 whiley et al 2009 however these assays are not able to type and subtype seasonal influenza viruses simultaneously another limitation of these rrt-pcr assays is that they only target the novel h1 gene of the pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 virus jiang et al 2010 whiley et al 2009 resulting in a limited specificity that can result in false-negative diagnosis when sequence variations exist in the primer- or probe-targeted genes in addition there has been a report of some cross-reactivity between the pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 virus and the influenza a virus h5n1 when using the us cdcs rrt-pcr assay which is recommended by the world health organization who peacey et al 2009 the development of an rrt-pcr assay with improved sensitivity specificity and performance as well as the ability to distinguish pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 from seasonal influenza viruses would be most useful a taqman probe-based multiplex rrt-pcr assay is described that can detect all currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses including the pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 virus the assay can type simultaneously influenza viruses a and b and the major human subtypes human h1 h3 n1 and n2 this rrt-pcr protocol could aid in the surveillance diagnosis and management of the pandemic ah1n1 2009 influenza and seasonal influenzas the primers and taqman probes for the pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 named n1-2009 and for the consensus influenza a virus named flu a m were synthesised as previously described whiley et al 2009 and based on the whos recommendations httpwwweurowhointdocumentinfcdcrealtimertpcrh1n1pdf other primers and probes for the pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 virus and for seasonal influenza viruses such as human h1n1 and h3n2 were designed based on the sequence data obtained from the influenza virus resource httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgenomesflu table 1
 primersprobes for typing of the viral strains were designed to target the conserved regions of the m gene segment for the influenza a virus and of the np gene segment for the influenza b virus primersprobes for subtyping of viral strains were designed to target the ha gene segment for each of the three ha subtypes h1-consensus h1-pandemic ah1n1 2009 and h3 and the na gene segment for each of the three na subtypes n1-consensus n1-pandemic ah1n1 2009 and n2 in silico coverage of primersprobes was calculated using an in-house program based on work described previously bose et al 2009 with some modifications briefly a sequence was defined as a hit if there were two or less substitutions within the probe or if there were no substitutions within five bases from the 3 end one or less substitutions within 10 bases from the 3 end or three or less substitutions within the primers for degenerate primers or probes an acceptable hit was defined by the presence of an accurate match between the sequence data consensus made by bioedit 701 software and its primers or probes all primersprobes were grouped into four sets based on the pcr product size fluorochrome-labels and the pilot tests table 1 the four sets were designed for the detection of different subtypes set 1 for h1 of pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 and for the consensus h1 of influenza a viruses set 2 for n1 of pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 and for the consensus n2 of influenza a viruses set 3 for the consensus n1 and h3 of influenza a viruses and set 4 for conserved regions of the m gene of influenza a viruses the np gene for influenza b viruses and the gapdh internal marker gene for homo sapiens the four sets of primers and probes were aliquoted into four different tubes for the multiplex rrt-pcr assay two known subtypes of influenza a virus strains apr834 h1n1 and ajiangxi2422004 h3n2 together with an influenza b virus bshanghai3612002 strain were provided by the chinese national influenza centre cnic an isolate of pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 abeijing012009 genbank accession number gq183617gq183624 and 11 seasonal influenza a virus isolates of unknown subtypes named abeijing4046 4053 3012 cy-30 3005 cy-29 4365 3032 3028 4368 and 30162008 were isolated from beijing china table 2

taq dna polymerase invitrogen according to the manufacturers instructions briefly 5 l of each nucleic acid sample were added to a 20 l master mix containing the following components at the indicated final concentrations 1 reaction buffer 1 l of superscript iii rtplatinum taq mix and 500 nm of each primer thermocycling was carried out as follows 1 min at 60 c 10 min at 42 c 30 min at 50 c and 15 min at 95 c for reverse transcription rt and denaturation 35 cycles at 94 c for 30 s at 52 c for 30 s and at 72 c for 1 min followed by 10 min at 72 c amplified products were analysed using electrophoresis on a 1 agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide purified pcr amplicons were cloned into the pgem-t easy vector promega madison wi and sequenced using an abi3730 dna analyzer applied biosystems norwalk ct statistical significance for the multiplex rrt-pcr assay and other standard detection methods such as for conventional subtyping pcr and the us cdcs real-time pcr was determined via mcnemars chi-square test for matched pairs a p-value 005 was considered significant to evaluate the coverage of all the primersprobes designed for the new multiplex rrt-pcr an in silico analysis using an in-house program was performed see section 21 the results showed that the coverage of these primersprobes  including sequences acquired from the literature whiley et al 2009 and from the who  was 901100 table 3
 to assess the specificity of the multiplex rrt-pcr the sequences of primersprobes were analysed by blast analysis no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses was found data not shown subsequently the cross-reactivity of the singleplex primersprobe was examined using a panel of virus strains and clinical specimens table 2 no obvious cross-reactivity was observed within influenza a virus type and its subtypes nor with influenza b virus type or any other respiratory viruses in addition one abeijing40462008 of the 11 influenza a virus isolates with unknown subtypes was identified as the h1n1 subtype and the other 10 strains as the h3n2 subtype table 2 these results were confirmed by subsequent sequencing of the pcr products all of the specific reactions had high positive fluorescence signals the mean cts were in the range of 153227 the standard deviations sds of the ct values ranged between 0004 and the coefficients of variation cvs were all less than 5 these data demonstrate the high specificity of the primersprobes designed for this novel multiplex rrt-pcr assay the limits of detection lods for each influenza virus in the multiplex reaction ranged from 10 to 104 copiesreaction table 4
 the lod for pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 detected by h1-consensus primersprobe in set 1 was 107 copiesreaction 667  102 tcid50ml however as the lods of the h1-2009 in set 1 and the n1-2009 in set 2 were 104 and 102 copiesreaction respectively the detection sensitivity of pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 was not affected the cvs of the ct values of the lods were all less than 4 based on statistical analysis suggesting that these results were reproducible to assess the reproducibility of the multiplex rrt-pcr assay mean ct values and sd cts were calculated at 105 copiesreaction for influenza a viruses and at 36  102 tcid50reaction for influenza b viruses the results showed that the cvs were 008097 for intra-assays and 004045 for inter-assays suggesting that the multiplex rrt-pcr assay is highly reproducible table 5
 to validate the performance of the new multiplex rrt-pcr assay parallel detections were performed using conventional subtyping pcr protocols recommended by the cnic and the us cdcs protocol for pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 with a panel of 151 clinical samples the results of these detections and those for influenza a virus subtyping are summarised in table 6
 the multiplex rrt-pcr assay subtyped the 105 seasonal influenza a viruses into 34 h1n1 and 71 h3n2 furthermore the multiplex rrt-pcr assay identified four new h1n1 and four new h3n2 strains which had not been identified by conventional pcr previously these new strains were confirmed through sequencing of the pcr products statistical analysis table 6 suggested that there were significant differences between the new multiplex rrt-pcr and the conventional subtyping pcr in the detection of seasonal influenza a virus p
  615  105 and in h1n1 subtyping p
  874  104 however there was no significant difference between the two methods in h3n2 subtyping p
  013 based on these observations the new multiplex rrt-pcr assay is more sensitive in subtyping influenza a viruses than the conventional pcr techniques the newly developed multiplex rrt-pcr showed high consistency 9688 in detecting pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 this is consistent with us cdcs rrt-pcr protocol as no significant differences were found between the two assays p
  100 table 6 interestingly sample ls1125-4 which was identified as pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 positive by the us cdcs rrt-pcr was subtyped as h3n2 with the multiplex rrt-pcr assay the identification of h3n2 was later confirmed by sequencing the pcr product in this report a new and rapid four-tube multiplex rrt-pcr system for influenza virus diagnosis was developed this system can simultaneously detect pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 virus distinguish seasonal influenza a and b viruses and subtype influenza a viruses into three ha and three na subtypes pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 seasonal h1n1 and h3n2 fig 1
 the assay improves on current standard assays and may aid in minimizing the transmission of pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 by identifying and distinguishing new cases of pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 from seasonal influenza the newly developed multiplex rrt-pcr system has several advantages over other assays for detection of influenza viruses first it is more sensitive than conventional pcr assays in subtyping influenza a viruses p
  615  105 compared with seasonal influenza a virus detection and p
  874  104 for h1n1 subtyping the analysis of the lod for pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 virus indicates that the strategy of multiple-targeting detection ensures the sensitivity of the assay system and effectively lowers the false-negative rate second owing to the de-novo design of primersprobes for two target genes h1-2009 and n1-2009 of the pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 virus and h3 and n2 of the h3n2 subtype etc the multiplex rrt-pcr assay is specific for the detection of the pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 virus fig 1a and that of the h3n2 subtype fig 1c and fig 2a as shown here one sample identified as pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 by the us cdcs rrt-pcr assay was confirmed to be the h3n2 subtype by the new assay based on sequence alignment the h1-2009 primersprobes had very low homologies with that for h3n2 fig 2b however there were high homologies between the sw h1 primersprobes of the us cdcs rrt-pcr and some h3n2 strains such as ahong kong1-9-ma21-31968 a strain that is highly homologous to the sequencing product of this test in particular the sw h1 reverse primer has eight continuous matches with ha sequences found at the 3 end in h3n2 an important terminal site for primer specificity kwok et al 1990 peacey et al 2009 fig 2c third in the new multiplex rrt-pcr system the consensus primersprobes cover the majority of ha and na sequences of each human influenza a subtype h1 h3 n1 and n2 found in the influenza virus resource database httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgenomesflu table 3 this allows the new assay to identify a wide range of influenza subtypes as seen in table 6 table 2 which present data for subtyping 105 randomly selected influenza a virus positive samples collected between january 2007 and december 2008 and 11 influenza a virus isolates of unknown subtypes fourth the new multiplex rrt-pcr assay is highly flexible as primersprobes can be easily adapted for the detection of some other or newly occurring subtypes of influenza viruses this adaptation would make the multiplex rrt-pcr a useful platform for the simultaneous detection and surveillance of multiple influenza viruses andor possibly other pathogens in summary a rapid multiplex rrt-pcr assay with high analytical sensitivity specificity and reproducibility has been developed the assay will be useful for the surveillance control and prevention of pandemic influenza ah1n1 2009 and seasonal influenzas  assessing the application of a pseudovirus system for emerging sars-cov-2 and re-emerging avian influenza virus h5 subtypes in vaccine development sheng-wen huang ching-hui tai yin-mei hsu dayna cheng su-jhen hung kit chai man ya-fang wang jen-ren wang   throughout the years many viruses have emerged and re-emerged an emerging virus may be defined as a newly discovered virus that has recently appeared within the population re-emerging viruses on the other hand may be defined as viruses that continuously reappear thus causing many epidemicsoutbreaks viruses such as enteroviruses ev dengue virus denv and influenza viruses eg h1n1 h5n1 h7n9 to name a few are considered re-emerging viruses due to their constant reappearance in the population 1 viral adaptation mechanisms such as mutation eg rna viruses 2 reassortment eg influenza virus 3 and recombination eg enteroviruses 4 aid in the evolution of the virus allowing it to cause new outbreaks and potential pandemics with each re-emergence 1 emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome  coronavirus mers-cov ebola virus zika virus zikv chikungunya virus chikv nipah virus niv and the most recent sars-cov-2 have also resulted in large epidemics and pandemics 1 in order to combat both emerging and re-emerging viruses effective drugs and vaccines are needed to treat and prevent the viral infections however in order to do so certain bio-safety level facilities are required for the handling of viruses that are considered to be highly pathogenic agents such as bio-safety level 3 bsl-3 facilities for sars-cov-2 mers-cov chikv and avian influenza and bsl-4 for ebola marburg virus marv lassa virus lasv and niv this poses a major limitation in the development of vaccines and drugs against the viruses on the other hand the use of a pseudovirus system can greatly aid in avoiding the handling of highly contagious viruses the pseudovirus system is a generating platform which utilizes vesicular stomatitis virus vsv or lentivirus vectors among others 5 the advantages of using such a system is its rapid production it is quantifiable and is relatively safe since progeny viruses can only undergo a single replication cycle 6 7 in the lentivirus-vector system although most of the vectors are derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 modified versions of the lentivirus vector are non-pathogenic 8 this is also the case in the vsv-g pseudovirus system in this system the vsv-g vector lacks the g envelope protein of vsv thus allowing for recombination with a foreign envelope protein andor reporter gene establishment of pseudoviruses using the lentivirus-vector system have been previously reported for emerging and re-emerging viruses that require bsl-34 facilities such as niv 9 marv 10 chikv 11 sars-cov-2 12 and certain influenza viruses 6 7 in addition mers-cov 13 14 sars-cov 15 16 ebola 17 and lasv 18 19 pseudoviruses have produced using both lentivirus and vsv-g pseudovirus systems in cases such as influenza and coronaviruses mers-cov sars-cov sars-cov-2 which their surface proteins mediate entry into host cells hemagglutinin ha and spike s protein respectively are combined with the pseudovirus vector cleavage of ha0 to ha1 and ha2 has been reported to be necessary for virus infectivity and determines the pathogenicity of the virus 20 21 22 23 similarly cleavage of the s protein to s1 and s2 of coronavirus enhances cell-cell fusion increases viral entry efficiency and determines virus infectivity 12 13 24 25 26 27 with the safer use of pseudoviruses in lower biosafety level facilities it has opened up greater possibilities for antibody detection vaccine research and drug selection to better combat both emerging and re-emerging viruses these viruses could be screened for the antigenicityimmunogenicity of antigen or antibody response by using neutralization tests and would be a useful tool for vaccine studies several studies have used pseudoviruses to detect and test neutralizing antibodies against viruses that pose a threat to the population and their response to viral infection 7 14 28 29 30 31 32 the use of pseudoviruses serve as an alternative to test vaccines thus eliminating one of the limitations once placed on vaccine development 9 33 34 35 furthermore better evaluation on the efficacy of drugs and selection of new drugs has been advantageous in combatting viral infections 36 37 here we established pseudovirus systems for emerging sars-covsars-cov-2 viruses and re-emerging avian influenza viruses including h5n2 h5n6 and h5n8 h5nx we assessed the feasibility of the pseudovirus system for neutralization assay and found a broad spectrum of applications such as vaccine candidate selection and vaccine efficacy including antigenic evolution and immunogenicity which provide valuable information in vaccine development especially for emerging and re-emerging viruses to generate sars-cov or sars-cov-2 and avian influenza virus pseudovirus we applied the lentiviral vector system provided by national rnai core of academic sinica taiwan to produce the pseudoviruses expressing full-length s protein and hana proteins respectively for sars-cov or sars-cov-2 pseudovirus the sequences of s protein were de novo synthesized synthesized genes were cloned into pmdg plasmid to express sars-cov or sars-cov-2 pseudoviruses for avian influenza virus pseudovirus ha and na sequences from different avian influenza viruses h5n2 h5n6 and h5n8 h5nx were synthesized and replaced the vsv-g envelope glycoprotein in pmdg plasmid cloned plasmids were transformed into one shot stbl3 chemically competent cell invitrogen and were amplified in lysogeny broth with 100 gml ampicillin plasmids were extracted by zymo research midi kit the 293t cells were seeded at the concentration of 2x106 cells in 6-well plates at 37c with 5 co2 for 24 hours and then the cells were transfected with 1 g of pcmvdeltar891 plas2wrfp-cpneo and pmdg plasmids pmdg with s gene for sars-cov or sars-cov-2 tagged by ha on the c-terminus and pmdg with indicated ha and na gene pairs for avian influenza virus respectively by polyjet reagent according to manufacturers instructions fig 1
 in the following of 24 hours post-transfection and the culture medium was displaced by freestyletm 293 expression medium gibco and then cultured for an additional 24 hours the total cell lysates collected were centrifuged to remove the cell debris then filtered through 045 m filters for immunoblot and further experiments for the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 pseudovirus we utilized the rabbit polyclonal antibody against sars-cov s protein arg54885 arigo biolaboratories and the mouse anti-ha tag monoclonal antibody c05012-100ug croyez bio against c terminal tag of sars-cov-2 s protein to detect s protein expression with 11000 dilution respectively for avian influenza virus h5nx pseudovirus we utilized mouse monoclonal h5n1 ha antibody 11048-mm06 sino biological with 11000 dilution the hrp-labeled secondary antibodies 474-1802 kpl with 11000 dilution were used for all immunoblot assays vero-e6 for sars-cov or sars-cov-2 pseudovirions and mdck cells for avian influenza virus h5nx pseudovirions were seeded in 24-well plates with 15x105 cellswell after 24 hours of culture cells were infected with 200 l of two-fold diluted viruses adsorbed for 1 hour and cultured at 37c for sars-cov or sars-cov-2 pseudovirions or 35c for avian influenza virus h5nx pseudovirions mouse antisera were complement inactivated at 56c for 30 minutes before neutralization assay the pseudoviruses were incubated with serially diluted antisera at 37c for 30 minutes the mixtures were added into vero-e6 at 37c or mdck cells at 35c for one hour incubation the assays were performed in duplicates cell medium were then refreshed with vero-e6 medium eagles mem with 1 mm sodium pyruvate 100 uml penicillin and 01 mgml streptomycin or mdck medium eagles mem with 1 gml trypsin 1 mm sodium pyruvate 100 uml penicillin and 01 mgml streptomycin four days post-infection infected cells with fluorescence were observed and fixed with 1  paraformaldehyde cells were resuspended with pbs for calculating the percentage of fluorescent positive cells through flow cytometer virus transduction unit was calculated with the formula titer ncndfv f the frequency of rfp-positive cells determined through flow cytometry cn the total number of target cells infected v the volume of the inoculum df the virus dilution factor 38 to quantify the neutralization titers for both sars-cov-2 and avian influenza pseudoviruses the neutralization titers were defined by 50 reduction of the transduction unit tu in both duplication of diluted antisera concentration compared with the average transduction units neutralization results of avian influenza virus subtypes were further visualized by antigenic cartography analysis which revealed the antigenic diversity of antigens in brief the short distance of antigens on antigenic map indicated similar antigenic properties between two antigens clustering scenario of antigens revealed the degree of diversity among tested antigen for sars-cov-2 antisera 6-8 weeks old balbc mice were subcutaneously immunized twice with 50 g of recombinant sars-cov-2 spike protein s1s2 ecd sino biological and emulsified in complete freunds adjuvant cfa sigma for priming and incomplete freunds adjuvant ifa sigma for the boost in a total of 100 l at a 3-week interval recombinant protein solutions in pbs were mixed 1 to 1 with the respective adjuvant blood samples were collected by submandibular blood sampling at week 5 after the first immunization for the avian influenza virus h5nx pseudovirus 20 ml of pseudoviruses were concentrated by lenti-xtm concentrator clontech then resuspended in pbs pseudoviruses were inactivated by uv light for 30 minutes and then used in mice immunization the pseudoviruses were used to immunize 6-8 weeks old balbc mice with the addition of adjuvant freunds complete adjuvant and freunds incomplete adjuvant which were performed by leadgene inc antisera were collected at 14 28 45 and 60-days post-immunization and pooled for neutralization assays due to the high infectivity and high pathogenicity of emerging virus sars-cov or sars-cov-2 and re-emerging virus avian influenza virus h5nx handling of the viruses in the biosafety level 3 facility are necessary but uneasily accessible to evaluate the vaccine efficacy by neutralization assay here we thus established two pseudovirus systems for emerging virus sars-cov or sars-cov-2 and re-emerging virus avian influenza virus h5nx including h5n2 h5n6 and h5n8 in order to generate pseudoviruses expressing emerging viruses structure proteins spike protein of sars-cov or sars-cov-2 and hana of avian influenza virus h5nx we replaced the vsv-g protein gene in pmdg plasmid by either the s gene of sars-cov or sars-cov-2 pmdsars-cov-spmdsars-cov-2-s or ha genes pmdh5nx-ha and na genes pmdh5nx-na of avian influenza viruses for avian influenza viruses ha and na genes from one to two strains of each subtypes were selected to develop pseudovirus systems including a who available or pending vaccine strain and a circulating strain we applied the lentiviral system which employed to express the structural proteins on the surface of pseudovirus and to package lentiviral rna with red fluorescence protein rfp reporter gene to get pseudoviruses with s or hana proteins expressed on the surface of virions respectively fig 1 the amount of generated pseudoviruses can thus be quantified according to the number of the cells expressing rfp following transduction by using the produced pseudovirus to verify whether the s or ha protein were incorporated into sars-cov or sars-cov-2 and avian influenza virus h5nx pseudovirus we used western blot to detect the structural proteins on the virions in sars-cov or sars-cov-2 pseudovirus particles complete s proteins approximately 190 kda and 220 kda of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 were detected by anti-sars-cov s protein antibody and anti-ha tag antibody respectively fig 2
a in contrast to the complete s protein of sars-covsars-cov-2 ha protein of avian influenza virus including ha0 approximately 80 kda and ha2 protein approximately 20 kda were observed in influenza virus pseudovirus by blotting with anti-influenza virus h5 ha2 protein antibody which indicated the partial cleavage of ha0 protein to ha1 and ha2 fig 2b the different cleavage manner between s and ha proteins in the pseudovirions might result from the diverse host protease requirement to digest the two structural proteins both s protein of coronavirus and ha protein of influenza virus harbor cleavage sites for different proteases in the boundary of s1s2 subunit and ha1ha2 subunit respectively 12 13 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 as complete ha0 and cleaved ha2 coexisted in the influenza virus pseudovirions the host cell hek293t supporting pseudovirus production might provide limited host proteases specific for the cleavage of ha protein in following the generation of the pseudoviruses we first focused on investigating the transduction efficiency by titrating the sars-cov or sars-cov-2 pseudovirus we first examined whether sars-cov or sars-cov-2 pseudovirus can transduce into vero-e6 cells abundant rfp fluorescence was observed in the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 pseudovirus-transduced vero-e6 cells suggesting the successful transduction of the pseudovirus fig 3
a sars-cov and sars-cov-2 pseudoviruses were serially diluted and then transducted into vero e6 cells respectively fig 4
a transduction unit tu of the virions were determined according to the percentage of rfp positive cells rfp in 48 hours post-transduction maximum  rfp reached 199 and 226 and  rfp increased in dose-dependent manners for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 pseudoviruses fig 5

 respectively as we quantified the transduction units according to the absolute number of rfp positive cells sars-cov-2 pseudovirion 236 x 106 tuml fig 5 had similar tu with sars-cov 233 x 105 tuml fig 6 according to the results of  rfp titer was also performed by using vsv-g pseudovirus as control group and maximum  rfp achieved 3105 referring to 385 x 106 tuml taken together the tu result implied similar pseudovirus production efficiency between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in our lentiviral pseudovirus system see fig 7 early sars coronavirus reports have shown that s1-s2 cleavage can be enhanced by exogenous proteases such as trypsin thermolysin and elastase 16 39 next we examined whether exogenous trypsin increases the transduction efficiency of our generated sars-cov and sars-cov-2 pseudovirus we added exogenous trypsin during sars-cov and sars-cov-2 pseudovirus absorption to vero-e6 cells until we harvested cells for cytometry analysis unexpectedly we observed a reduction in virion transduction with trypsin presence especially for sars-cov virions with trypsin treatment the tu of sars-cov virions decreased 93 from 95 x 105 to 65 x 104 tuml in contrast to dramatic tu reduction of sars-cov virions the tu of sars-cov-2 moderately reduced 43 from 109 x106 to 62 x 105 tuml fig 4b the transduction reduction effects of exogenous trypsin presence since virion absorption might have resulted from the trypsin cleavage of partial s proteins on the unbound virions being cleaved into s1s2 subunits by trypsin in advance of virion fusion in the vero-e6 cells however only moderate effects on sars-cov-2 virion fusion in contrast with sars-cov might imply that the s protein of sars-cov-2 were more resistant to trypsin cleavage in addition sars-cov-2 virion might mainly utilize proteases other than trypsin such as furin 40 as fusing with vero-e6 cells whether trypsin or furin treatment after virion binding to cells enhances sars-cov or sars-cov-2 virions entry into vero-e6 cells will be further investigated in the future in facing the emerging sars-cov-2 virus outbreak evaluation of the vaccine efficacy as the vaccine development of sars-cov-2 becomes urgently needed to reduce the threat of the virus in order to evaluate vaccine efficacy against such highly contagious virus more efficiently we applied the generated sars-cov-2 pseudovirus for evaluation of the neutralization antibody by using neutralization assay to examine whether the lentivirus-based pseudovirus is capable to be applied in the neutralization assay we retrieved two mouse antisera from the national health research institutes whereby the antisera were obtained from mice were immunized by sars-cov-2 s recombinant protein antisera were serially diluted in two-folds to neutralize a total amount of 64x105 tu of sars-cov-2 pseudovirus with duplication we determined the antisera titers according to the antisera dilution exhibiting 50 reduction of virus transduction in both duplicated neutralization experiments table 1
 antisera neutralization results demonstrated that the lentivirus-based pseudovirus successfully applied in determining neutralization antibody titrations of antisera we successfully defined the titers of two different mouse antisera neutralization result indicated that 150 to 1400 diluted antiserum ms-1 neutralized the sars-cov-2 spike pseudovirus in both duplication experiments although 1800 diluted antiserum ms-1 still neutralized over 50 sars-cov-2 pseudovirus transduction in one of the duplicates in contrast to ms-1 antiserum no dilutions of ms-2 antiserum neutralized the sars-cov-2 spike pseudovirus in both duplication experiments according to the result antiserum ms-1 exhibited higher titers 1400 against sars-cov-2 pseudovirus than antiserum ms-2 150 in summary the results demonstrated that we successfully generated sars-cov and sars-cov-2 lentivirus-based pseudovirus that is able to be applied in determining neutralization antibody of the antisera within in vitro neutralization assay producing neutralization antibody against the immunodominant viral protein is one of the important factors to evaluate vaccine efficacy our pseudovirus neutralization assay will become a feasible tool in the sars-cov-2 vaccine development after successfully establishing emerging virus sars-cov-2 pseudovirus transduction and neutralization assays we next investigated the generated pseudovirions of re-emerging virus avian influenza virus h5nx in contrast to using vero-e6 by sars-cov or sars-cov-2 pseudovirus we examined whether avian influenza virus h5nx pseudovirus can be transduced into mdck cells as host cells alike to sars-cov or sars-cov-2 virions we observed abundant rfp fluorescence pseudovirus-transduced mdck cells indicating the successful transduction of the avian influenza virus h5nx pseudovirus fig 3b according to the percentage of rfp positive cells rfp in 48 hours post-transduction different influenza h5nx subtypes showed similar transduction unit tu within 106 to 108 tuml in mdck cells fig 3c although the diverse tus were seen among the subtypes we thus successfully transduced pseudovirions of re-emerging avian influenza virus h5nx into mdck cells as host cells we next examined the applicability of avian influenza virus h5nx pseudovirus in neutralization assay contrast to single type of sars-cov-2 due to only one dominant strain various avian influenza virus subtypes co-circulated in worldwide our study selected three recently circulating subtypes of avian influenza virus in taiwan and worldwide including h5n2 h5n6 and h5n8 subtypes to determine the neutralization antibody by using h5nx pseudovirus instead of raising antibody by structural protein expressing recombinant protein subunit vaccine in sars-cov-2 virus we concentrated the inactivated avian influenza pseudovirus as immunogens to raise antisera against avian influenza ha and na structural proteins in mice we determined neutralization antibody titers of raised antisera against different subtypes of influenza virus and generated an antigenic map to analyze the similarity of antigenicity according to neutralization antibody titers mouse antisera were respectively generated by each selected strain and examined neutralization activities against all selected avian influenza pseudovirions neutralization titers demonstrated that avian influenza virus exhibited partial cross-reactivity among h5n2 h5n6 and h5n8 subtypes high neutralization titers of antisera between 1160 and 15120 were observed among examined subtypes table 2
 implied the immunogens combining ha and na proteins of h5n2 h5n6 or h5n8 can induce antisera with high neutralization activities among the examined pseudovirions as immunogens antiserum which was raised by h5n8 twx37 virus showed consistently high titers 11280 to 1 2560 against all pseudovirions suggesting that h5n8 twx37 virus can be a suitable vaccine candidate for broad spectrum avian influenza virus vaccine although on average high neutralization titers were generally seen among the antisera against diverse subtype pseudovirus we still observed the 2 to 8-folds of different titers among examined pseudovirions as which were neutralized by each antiserum anti-h5n2 washington antiserum exhibited high neutralization titers 11280 against all tested pseudovirions except for h5n6-tw17 strain 1320 with 4 folds of titer reduction in contrast anti-h5n6 hyogo antiserum showed the highest titers against itself but lower titers against other pseudovirus with 2 to 8 folds of reduction also antigenic cartography indicated that h5n2 washington pseudovirus exhibited diverse antigenic properties in comparing with other virions suggesting antigenic diversity occurrence among avian influenza h5nx subtypes fig 8
 together we developed lentiviral pseudovirus systems of emerging sars-cov2 virus and re-emerging avian influenza virus as biologically safer efficacy evaluation assays than conventional neutralization assays needed to perform within biosafety level 3 containment when we developed a vaccine the neutralization assay results not only reflected neutralization activities of antisera but also revealed the immunogenicity and antigenic property diversity of re-emerging viral subtypes which is another important issue for vaccine seed selection in re-emerging virus vaccine development vaccine development of emerging and re-emerging viruses are always urgent as we continuously face their strong threats for our lives to examine the efficacy of developed vaccines neutralization activity of immunized animals and even human individuals was one of the most important indicators for vaccine evaluation however the highly pathogenic viruses needed to be operated in a high level of biosafety containment to protect not only laboratory personnel as well as the surrounding environment and community which increased the assessability difficulty for in vitro viral infection experiment including neutralization assay pseudovirus system have been widely applied in the studies of highly pathogenic viruses including sars-covsars-cov-2 and high pathogenic avian influenza virus which reduced the safety requirement and increase the assessability of neutralization assay against these viruses 9 10 14 29 30 32 36 37 40 we here developed two series of pseudoviruses for emerging coronavirus sars-cov or sars-cov-2 and re-emerging virus avian influenza virus h5nx by using lentiviral packaging system the pseudoviruses stimulated the viral entry of studied viruses through their structural proteins and were applied to examine whether antisera had neutralization activities to block viral fusion into the target cells indeed our results demonstrated that the viral entry of the sars-cov-2 and avian influenza h5nx pseudoviruses can be blocked by the antisera raised by sars-cov-2 s protein and inactivated avian influenza h5nx pseudovirus respectively the successful neutralization indicated that the assay can be applied in vaccine development of either emerging or re-emerging viruses and the assay can be operated in a more available biosafety facility in addition to evaluate the neutralization activity vaccine development needs to evaluate the antigenicity and immunogenicity for vaccine seed strain selection especially for re-emerging viruses such as avian influenza virus h5 containing various subtypes although recent emerging sars-cov-2 has only one dominant strain with genetic variants we suspected that the emerging virus might steadily evolve with antigenic drift like influenza virus under strong herd immunity in the near future due to the high transmission rate with millions of confirmed reported cases around the world if the recent emerging sars-cov-2 continuously circulates among the community and becomes another re-emerging virus sars-cov-2 will also face a strong positive selection pressure from herd immunity which drives the virus to exhibit diverse antigenic properties and causes antigenic property changes constant surveying of the antigenic evolution of sars-cov-2 virus and updating the vaccine antigen for inactivated vaccine recombinant s protein antigen for subunit vaccine or even delivered s gene for dnarna vaccine are necessary in the process of vaccine development in the following of surveying antigenic property of re-emerging virus the immunogenicity of re-emerging s proteingene will be next examined the immunogenicity analysis of vaccine antigen provides valuable information for vaccine selection indicating the true scenario of raised neutralizing antibody response against target virus according to the immunogenicity results we will assess the feasibility of utilizing selected antigens as immunogens to induce proper neutralizing antibody response here we used avian influenza virus h5 as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of our pseudovirus system applying in not only vaccine efficacy evaluation by using neutralization assay but also antigenicity and immunogenicity assessments by utilizing pseudovirus of re-emerging viruses as we used various h5nx concentrated pseudovirus as antigens to immunize mice we revealed minor diversity of antigenic property and immunogenicity of each examined h5nx pseudovirus by antigenic cartography in previous studies antigenic cartography was successfully applied using influenza enterovirus a71 and dengue viruses to access the antigenic variation 41 42 43 44 45 46 combining with cross-neutralization results and antigenic cartography we visualized the antigenic properties of influenza virus h5nx subtypes results demonstrated that the avian influenza virus h5nx localized in a short distance on the antigenic map which shows the close antigenic property among examined h5nx subtypes nonetheless the cross-neutralization results revealed the different feasibility of h5nx antigens to raise neutralizing antisera we found that antisera raised from h5n8 twx37 immunization showed the generally broad spectrum of neutralization against all examined subtypes pseudovirus suggesting its good immunogenicity against avian influenza viruses h5n2 h5n6 and h5n8 taken together our investigations successfully established lentiviral pseudovirus systems for emerging sars-cov-2 and re-emerging avian influenza virus h5nx we assessed the feasibility of pseudovirions in the process of vaccine development pseudovirus system showed convincing results for vaccine efficacy by applying pseudovirions in neutralization assay for both sars-cov-2 and avian influenza viruses in addition we showed the potency of pseudovirions to be applied in antigenic property analysis and immunogenicity analysis which is especially important for antigen candidate selection most important of all the pseudovirus system exhibited a lower biosafety risk than wild-type high risk viruses such as sars-covsars-cov-2 and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus h5 that can be handled in a biosafety level 2 laboratory through this system we might shorten the time frame and provide more suitable vaccine candidate in the process of vaccine

interest  cryptosporidium infection in herds with and without calf diarrhoeal problems charlotte silverls kerstin de verdier ulf emanuelson jens mattsson g camilla bjrkman   diarrhoea is a common problem in young calves and a cause of impaired animal welfare farmers may suffer large economic losses due to veterinary treatments mortality and reduced growth rates calf diarrhoea has a multifactorial aetiology and cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that is frequently associated with the disease de la fuente et al 1999 joachim et al 2003 snodgrass et al 1986 the parasite is resistant in the environment fayer 2008 creating high infection pressures in some affected herds other common diarrhoeal pathogens are rotavirus coronavirus and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli f5 barrington et al 2002 de la fuente et al 1999 foster and smith 2009 e coli f5 causes diarrhoea in calves younger than 1 week whereas the other three pathogens mainly cause diarrhoea in 1- to 3-week-old calves individual calf factors such as failure of passive transfer of colostral antibodies and management associated factors such as personnel and stable hygiene routines at calving milk feeding regimens and crowding affect the course of disease barrington et al 2002 a limitation with previously performed studies on the association of diarrhoea and cryptosporidiosis in calves is that all oocysts approximately 5 m in diameter until recently were recognised as c parvum however molecular diagnostic methods have shown that three morphologically similar species c parvum cryptosporidium bovis and cryptosporidium ryanae can be found in cattle several studies applying dna analysis have identified c parvum in 880955 of preweaned calf diarrhoeal samples with c bovis and c ryanae detected in 059 and 1659 of samples respectively plutzer and karanis 2007 soba and logar 2008 thompson et al 2007 in contrast to c parvum c bovis c ryanae and a fourth larger species cryptosporidium andersoni are considered to be associated with subclinical infection in cattle fayer et al 2007 langkjaer et al 2006 we have shown that cryptosporidium parasites are ubiquitous in swedish dairy herds but we found no association between infection and diarrhoea in individual calves silverls et al 2009 with the help of dna analysis we identified c bovis as the most prevalent species 74 in preweaned calves and c parvum c bovis and c ryanae were all detected in diarrhoeal calves silverls et al 2010 it is thus not correct to conclude that diarrhoea is associated with c parvum solely based on the presence of c parvum-like oocysts the improved diagnostic methods call for to further examine the relationship between cryptosporidium infection and diarrhoea it is also important to identify additional factors affecting the course of infection because a key component for improved calf health in herds with cryptosporidium-associated diarrhoea is to decrease infection pressure by improved management the objective of this herd level casecontrol study was to investigate the role of cryptosporidium infection with the added value of information on the different cryptosporidium spp in swedish dairy herds facing a problem with calf diarrhoea to get a more complete picture of the diarrhoeal problems other pathogens and animal and management factors were also investigated ten case herds and 10 control herds with 50 milking cowsyear were included case herds were defined as herds that had current problems with diarrhoea in calves each case herd was matched to a control herd without calf health problems with approximately the same number of cows and situated in the same veterinary district possible case and control herds were identified by herd health veterinarians who had followed these herds over several years and thus had a long-time insight into the calf health of each herd a questionnaire was designed to get information about herd structure and management factors believed to influence prevalence of cryptosporidium-infected and diseased animals questions were grouped as follows general herd information routines at calving calf management disease in calves weaned calf and young stock management the questionnaire is available in swedish from the first author upon request the study was conducted during the indoor seasons mid october to end of march 20062007 n  3 pairs and 20072008 n  7 pairs and each herd was visited once samplings were done by herd health veterinarians or by author cs matched casecontrol herds were sampled by the same veterinarian within a week from each other a total of eight veterinarians participated detailed instructions about sampling procedures and data collection were sent to participating veterinarians to minimise personnel bias rectal faecal samples were collected from 10 calves 2 months old 10 young stock 412 months old and five periparturient cows 1 week before expected partus to 2 weeks post partum any additional calves with diarrhoea were also sampled eight herds had insufficient number of calves young stock or periparturient cows at sampling in which case all calves or young stock in the preset age interval and five cows as close to the preset interval as possible were sampled jugular vein blood was collected in serum tubes from a maximum of five 1- to 8-day-old calves in each herd for sampled calves a number of parameters eg age the consistency of faeces general condition pen environment and any medical treatment drug disease and dates of treatment were recorded for sampled young stock and cows consistency of faeces and age were recorded for cows the number of days in relation to calving was also recorded the visiting veterinarian completed the questionnaires through interviews with the farmers all faecal samples were processed by a saturated sodium chloride flotation method and analysed for cryptosporidium oocysts by epifluorescence microscopy as described previously silverls et al 2009 the detection limit of this method is 50100 oocysts per gram faeces opg andersson 2004 concentrated samples were stored at 48c the aim was to analyse two samples positive for c parvum-like oocysts 5 m  from each age group and herd if more than two positive samples were present random selection was done all samples with the larger c andersoni oocysts 5  75 m were analysed dna was extracted using a combined freeze-thawing and qiaamp dna stool mini kit qiagen protocol a nested pcr protocol for amplification of a 800-bp segment of the 18s rrna gene and sequencing of pcr products was used for species determination samples containing c parvum were subtyped through amplification of a 800-bp segment of the 60-kda glycoprotein gp60 gene using a nested pcr protocol and sequencing all methods have previously been described silverls et al 2010 all calf faecal samples were investigated for presence of rota- and coronavirus whereas presence of e coli f5 was investigated in samples from calves 14 days faeces for viral and bacteriological analyses were frozen at arrival to the laboratory and thawed and analysed at the end of each sampling season total protein tp in blood was estimated the day samples arrived at the laboratory rotavirus and coronavirus were detected by indirect antigen elisas e coli f5 was detected by cultivation on blood agar and agglutination test of a few randomly selected colonies these methods are used in the routine diagnostics at the swedish national veterinary institute sva blood samples were centrifuged at 1500g for 10 min at room temperature and tp was assessed by refractometry of the serum calves with 55 gl tp were considered to have sufficient colostral antibody uptake radostits 2000 statistical analysis was done using stata 10

 neonatal mortality was registered as number of deaths before weaning in the last 20 calves born alive calves had died in six case herds and in one control herd table 2 mortality was mostly due to diarrhoea but respiratory disease trauma and unknown causes were also registered no calves had been treated prophylactically or therapeutically against cryptosporidiosis prior to sampling seven variables had p  025 in univariable modelling table 3 the multivariable regression model contained three significant variables and one confounder table 3 c bovis status gave reduced odds of belonging to a case herd but calves with unknown c bovis status undetermined c parvum-like spp did not differ from calves negative for c bovis ie cryptosporidium negative or infected with c parvum or c ryanae the variable c parvum identified in herd did not produce a significant odds ratio but acted as a confounder for both disinfection of single pens and most common type of diarrhoea

 odds of being a case herd calf were higher if the type of diarrhoea varied considerably compared to if pasty diarrhoea was most common in a herd there was also a tendency of higher odds in calves from herds where watery diarrhoea was most common when a farmer reported to routinely disinfect single pens between calves the odds of being a case herd calf were higher than if disinfection was not a routine no significant interactions were detected the model had a rather poor fit table 3 but the area under the receiver operated characteristics curve was 091 maximum 1 and no residual outliers were detected the complexity of cryptosporidium infection and its association to clinical symptoms is reflected in that we found cryptosporidium-infected calves in all investigated herds and similar shedding rates of c parvum c bovis and undetermined c parvum-like spp in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic calves which shows that massive c parvum infection is not sufficient to produce diarrhoea shedding rates approximately follow bell shaped curves over time and shedding intensity and diarrhoeal intensity seem to peak around the same time jarvie et al 2005 joachim et al 2003 lallemond et al 2006 lefay et al 2001 villacorta et al 1991 for calves with high c parvum shedding rates it is thus likely that the parasite is associated with diarrhoea and the identification of high numbers of c bovis oocysts in diarrhoeic samples indicates that this species can cause diarrhoea in calves c bovis has been associated with subclinical infection santn et al 2004 but massive intestinal invasion with subsequent diarrhoea should be possible if enough other factors such as lack of passive immunity are present even if this species would lack virulence factors similar to those present in c parvum the interpretation of diarrhoeal samples containing a few oocysts is not as straightforward especially when such a sensitive diagnostic method as ours is used and only one sample per calf is collected because intestinal damage is caused by the intracellular parasite stages diarrhoea might be present already when the first few oocysts are shed because these do not reflect the intensity of intestinal invasion moreover calves with failure of passive transfer of colostral antibodies have poor health to start with and might develop diarrhoea more easily and at a lower degree of intestinal invasion than calves with sufficient passive transfer on the other hand if the few oocysts reflect low-grade infection the real cause for diarrhoea could be an unidentified pathogen repeated samplings are crucial to confirm or reject the association between infection and diarrhoea in these calves but that could not be done in this study we have earlier identified the c parvum subtypes iiaa16g1r1 and iiaa21g1r1 found here in swedish cattle silverls et al 2010 whereas subtype iiaa17g1r1 was first identified in this study we found subtype iiaa16g1r1 in one non-diarrhoeic calf in the preceding study silverls et al 2010 as well as in five non-diarrhoeic calves from this study but this subtype and iiaa17g1r1 have both previously been identified in diarrhoeic calf samples plutzer and karanis 2007 soba and logar 2008 thompson et al 2007 we were first to report subtype iiaa21g1r1 in two calves silverls et al 2010 and this subtype has now been identified in three non-diarrhoeic calves in total the gp60 locus used to identify these c parvum subtypes encodes a glycoprotein situated in the apical region of invasive stages of the parasite gp60 subtypes are also identified in the human species c hominis and have been associated with varying pathogenicity in hiv patients cama et al 2007 due to the low number of subtyped samples in this study conclusions about pathogenicity or association with diarrhoeal problems cannot be made this study was designed at herd level and diarrhoeic calf samples were not targeted for dna analysis still 40 of diarrhoeic cryptosporidium-positive calf samples were sequenced compared to 28 of non-diarrhoeic samples although only two cryptosporidium-positive calf samples per herd were subjected to dna analysis these represented a random sample and should not bias the species distribution at least one of the investigated pathogens were detected in most diarrhoeic samples but an equal or even higher percentage of the non-diarrhoeic calves also harboured them in addition only one of 16 calves with mixed infections had diarrhoea about half of all diarrhoeic calves were older than 4 weeks this indicates that other diarrhoeal causes such as eimeria spp or dietary imbalances could also be present in the herds of this study however diarrhoeal pathogens outside the c parvum diarrhoeal window were not targeted because the main focus was to investigate the role of different cryptosporidium species in herds with diarrhoeal problems the reason for including calves older than 4 weeks is that we have shown cryptosporidium infection to be common in this age group silverls et al 2009 preweaned calves are often kept close together so these calves may act as an important infection source for the younger ones indeed a high prevalence in old calves was shown in this study as well fig 1 young stock and cows were also included to get an impression of the overall cryptosporidium infection pressure in the herds even though rotavirus and coronavirus are considered major diarrhoeal pathogens in calves they were uncommon also in case herds in the present study we have no explanation for the results regarding rotavirus we used the same elisa and the same person performed the analysis as in two swedish studies that identified rotavirus in 24 and 44 of diarrhoeal samples and in 89 and 37 of non-diarrhoeal samples bjrkman et al 2003 de verdier klingenberg and svensson 1998 the coronavirus results are not so surprising bjrkman et al 2003 found a low prevalence 3 of coronavirus-positive diarrhoeal samples and in a recent norwegian study gulliksen et al 2009 no diarrhoeal samples were positive for coronavirus in addition our results are supported by snodgrass et al 1986 who found coronavirus to be equally common in healthy and diseased calves the low prevalence of e coli f5-positive samples was in accordance with previous studies bjrkman et al 2003 de verdier klingenberg and svensson 1998 other pathogens such as salmonella spp have been reported as common calf diarrhoeal pathogens barrington et al 2002 in addition bovine viral diarrhoea virus bvdv is recognised as an important calf health modulator worldwide among other things causing immunosuppression and diarrhoea as a result of successful control programmes bvdv and salmonella are uncommon in swedish cattle with 998 of herds being free from bvdv professor stefan alenius personal communication and salmonella only being identified in five to 13 herds per year anonymous 2007 although diarrhoea was more common in case herd calves in total only 31 of 196 sampled calves had diarrhoea at sampling this could be due to naturally fluctuating infection pressures even if diarrhoeal prevalences were quite low in case herds and pathogen distribution was similar in healthy and diarrhoeal calves from case and control herds the identification of herds as cases or controls were performed by veterinarians with insight into the herds calf health status we thus are confident that cases and controls were correctly classified ten casecontrols is a small sample size but a larger sample was not possible for logistic reasons several variables indicated differences between case and control herds table 2 and more case herd calves had diarrhoea compared to control herd calves at a glance individual calving pens colostral feeding by bottle etc were more common in control herds indicating better management routines and thus better biosecurity management routines in case herds also seemed to vary more than in control herds table 2 all case herd farmers applied at least one good management routine but which ones differed this indicates that different routines have to be addressed to improve biosecurity in the case herds because of the differences in colostrum feeding strategies between case and control herds we did not expect median tp values to be comparable both case and control herd calves had median tps close to the acceptable value of 55 gl radostits 2000 which shows that approximately half of all calves had insufficient colostral uptake colostral routines obviously needed improvement but just as much in control herds as in case herds a swedish study including 8964 heifer calves noted a 31 mortality rate in the first 90 days from birth svensson et al 2006 accepting a 5 mortality rate ie one of 20 three case herds and one control herd had elevated mortality rates 1015 an interesting finding was that disinfection of single pens between calves was much more common in case herds the same association has been shown for weaners maddox-hyttel et al 2006 this association could be seen as an effectie herds with diarrhoeal problems start to disinfect however because these herds still had problems disinfection seemed either not to work or to be insufficient moreover if disinfection routines were started a short time prior to sampling the full effect might not have been reached at the time of sampling we did not ask about how long these routines had been used and cannot investigate this possibility further because of the high risk of recall bias a potential explanation for disinfection not working is that farmers rely on the disinfectant to do the work of reducing infection pressure instead of cleaning thoroughly without proper cleaning only the surface of the dirt layer is disinfected pathogens can continue to thrive beneath and calves are exposed again as soon as the top layer is disrupted cryptosporidia are resistant to most commercial disinfectants fayer 2008 thus if cryptosporidia constitute a large part of the problem even proper disinfection that reduces viral and bacterial pathogens would not be successful of the disinfectants used by farmers in this study virkon has not proven effective against cryptosporidium oocysts fayer 2008 table 19 lime seems to reduce oocyst numbers graczyk et al 2008 zintl et al 2010 these studies used quicklime cao on sewage sludge graczyk et al 2008 or hydrated lime caoh2 in water solution and purified oocyst solutions incubated in used bedding material zintl et al 2010 the effect of powdered hydrated lime on faecal oocysts has to our knowledge not been tested still this might be at least partially effective in reducing oocyst load we have not been able to identify references concerning the components of stalosan f drying and heating are effective for decreasing oocyst viability fayer 2008 table 17 thus proper cleaning with water followed by drying and use of powdered quicklime or the use of deep litter bedding provided that the surface is regularly overlaid with dry clean bedding material might be two effective ways of keeping cryptosporidium infection pressure down calves infected with c bovis had lower odds of belonging to a case herd indicating that c bovis is more common in herds without diarrhoeal problems and that c parvum is really the species associated with diarrhoea the fact that disinfection of single pens was identified as a risk factor could have several explanations that have already been discussed the type of diarrhoea most common in preweaned calves could also be seen as an effect rather than a risk for belonging to a case herd this variable was introduced in the model as an indicator of total infection pressure hypothesising that a low total infection pressure would be more associated with pasty diarrhoea and that a high total infection pressure would be more associated with watery diarrhoea because some farmers stated that the type of diarrhoea varied considerably this represented a third level of the variable indeed although the level watery diarrhoea tended to have higher or this was the level that produced a significantly higher or compared to pasty diarrhoea a highly fluctuating infection pressure due to eg long time between thorough cleaning of pens or fluctuations in calving intensity could explain the significant association cryptosporidium infection was equally common in case and control herds showing that these parasites can be abundant without causing diarrhoeal problems our results emphasise that management factors are important to whether diarrhoea will develop or not after infection with one or more of the investigated pathogens including the pathogenic cryptosporidium species c parvum  clinical characteristics of different subtypes and risk factors for the

isolated the novel coronavirus and shared the viral genome sequence to world health organization who 1 the novel coronavirus was identified as a novel enveloped rna betacoronavirus and named 2019 novel coronavirus later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses which has a phylogenetic similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov but the contagosity is higher than sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 2 in order to prevent the epidemic of this contagion chinese government made a decision to temporarily shut down the traffic departing from wuhan on 23 january 2020 and adopted a series of control measures who declared the spread of sars-cov-2 was listed as a public health emergency of international concern and subsequently designated the pneumonia infected by sars-cov-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 3 until 19 april 2020 covid-19 has swept across 213 countries and regions which reported 2 245 872 confirmed cases and 152 707 deaths the largest number of confirmed cases were in the united states followed by spain and italy 4 this phenomenon signified fighting with covid-19 is not only a matter for china but an imperative event for global nowadays the majority of studies on covid-19 in china are focused on wuhan the hardest-hit area and little is known about the clinical features of covid-19 outside of wuhan 57 the study of chang et al 8 included 13 cases in beijing and the research of xu et al 9 enrolled 62 cases in zhejiang however due to the small sample size clinical characteristics might be not comprehensive researches with a larger number of confirmed cases were urgently needed outside of wuhan the clinical spectrum of covid-19 appears to be wide comprising mild type without pneumonia common type with pneumonia severe type with respiratory distress and critical type with respiratory failure shock or even death 10 diverse subtypes have their unique features whether in epidemiology or laboratory results a study with 72 314 cases reported by the chinese center for disease control and prevention china cdc showed that the case-fatality rate was 490 among critical cases 11 therefore mastering the characteristics of different subtypes and early identification of the severity of illness is of great significance for the treatment hence the aim of our study is to summarize the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics laboratory and radiograph findings treatments and outcomes of different subtypes of patients with covid-19 in zhejiang province on this basis we want to explore risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with covid-19 and appeal to clinicians to attach importance to these factors we conducted a retrospective study investigating on the epidemiological clinical laboratory radiograph treatments and outcomes characteristics of confirmed cases of covid-19 in zhejiang province from 17 january to 12 february 2020 diagnosis of covid-19 was in accordance with the interim guidance from the who 12 a confirmed case of covid-19 was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay of sputum and throat swab specimens only laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled in our study data were uniformly collected by the health commission of zhejiang province where all patients were allocated at specific hospitals for unified treatment according to the government emergency rule all data enrolled in our study had been shared with who and the preliminary results were reported to the authority of zhejiang province information of medical records were gathered and sent to the data collection center in hangzhou demographic epidemiological clinical laboratory treatments and outcomes data were exacted from electronic medical records using a standardized data collection form a group of doctors who have experiences in treating the patients with covid-19 reviewed and disposed the data when information was incomplete the working team in hangzhou would contact the doctor in charge for explanation this study was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of the first affiliated hospital college of medicine zhejiang university no iit20200005c written informed consent was waived by the ethics commission of the designated hospital and oral consent was obtained from patients sputum and throat swab specimens collected from all patients were tested by rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 rna briefly the cdc of zhejiang province and at municipal level and the first affiliated hospital school of medicine zhejiang university were responsible for confirmation of sars-cov-2 with national authorization laboratory tests were conducted on admission including blood routine examinations serum biochemical tests coagulation function examinations infection-related biomarkers and an identification of other respiratory pathogens such as influenza a virus influenza b virus parainfluenza virus adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus chest radiograph or computed tomography ct was done for all inpatients at admission treatment measures and outcomes were followed up to 12 february 2020 the illness severity of covid-19 was defined according to the chinese management guideline for covid-19 version 60 13 patients with covid-19 was categorized as mild common severe and critical according to the illness severity mild type was defined as mild symptoms and no pneumonia on imaging common type was defined as having respiratory tract symptoms and imaging with pneumonia severe type was defined as satisfying any of the following items 1 respiratory distress and respiratory frequency  30min 2 blood oxygen saturation  93 at rest 3 pao2fio2 ratio  300 mmhg 4 lung infiltrates  50 within 2448 h critical type was defined as satisfying any of the following items 1 respiratory

exposure to the onset of illness which was estimated among patients who could provide the exact data of close contact with confirmed or suspected individuals family cluster was defined as occurring two or more cases with fever andor respiratory symptoms within the family in recent 2 weeks fever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 373 c gastrointestinal symptoms included nausea emesis and diarrhea once the temperature returned to normal for more than 3 days respiratory symptoms significantly improved the imaging of lung obviously absorbed and two consecutive negative results for sars-cov-2 antigen sampling interval at least 1 day patients could be discharged from hospital continuous variables were presented as median interquartile range iqr and compared using kruskal-wallis categorical variables were presented as frequency percentages and compared using the 2 test or fishers exact test when appropriate to analyze risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with covid-19 univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were used variables with p  005 in the univariate models were selected into the multivariate model for calculating a two-sided  of  005 was considered statistically significant all the analyses were done with spss version 250 ibm corporation armonk ny usa the kaplan-meier method was used to estimate hospitalization time and the log rank test was applied for comparisons among mild common and severe type the kaplan-meier analysis was performed using survival packages in r version 361 r foundation vienna austria from 17 january 2020 to 12 february 2020 clinical data were collected on 788 patients with covid-19 in zhejiang province according to the definition of clinical classification they were divided into 52 cases 66 of mild type 658 cases 835 of common type 61 cases 77 of severe type and 17 cases 22 of critical type as shown in table 1 the median age in mild common severe and critical type was 375 years iqr

 the outbreak of covid-19 is now becoming an enormous threat to public health with further research of the structure and infection mechanism of respiratory scientists found angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 might be the site of sars-cov-2 binding on the surface of cells with the same route of infection of sars-cov 14 it has been proved that ace2 might play an important role in virus transmission and infection sars-cov-2 not only attacked the lung but also caused damages to many other organs including heart kidney liver and central nervous system 3 6 15 16 the diagnosis of covid-19 was complicated by the diversity in symptoms imaging findings and the severity of illness therefore describing features of each subtype and exploring risk factors for the severity of illness could help clinicians to better tackle with this disease in this respective study the median age of critical types was higher than the other three types with the reason of low immunity and degeneration of related physiological function in older the length of the incubation period is related to many factors such as the number of pathogens the time required for toxin production and transmission and human immunity the incubation period was shorter in severe type probably due to poor immunity and higher viral load 17 fever and cough were the dominant symptoms in all subtypes while hemoptysis was rare fever is a protective mechanism by activating the immune systems to resist pathogens and cough is a reflective defense against invaders when an individual was infected the above two symptoms generally appeared at early stage although hemoptysis was an atypical symptom it was reported that there was covid-19 patient admitted only with hemoptysis as the initial symptom 18 moreover we should be alert to the patients who didnt have a fever due to 66 of severe type without fever in our study hypertension and diabetes were the most pervasive underlying diseases in all subtypes and the proportion of them were higher in critical type in consideration of the aged constituting the majority of the critical type it is common that the rates of comorbidities increased according to the laboratory results the decrease of lymphocyte occurred in 706 of critical type the decrease of lymphocyte was a prominent feature of critical type in our cohort which was consistent with a previous study 19 sars-cov-2 might mainly act on lymphocyte especially t lymphocytes as did sars-cov 6 in addition the increased ast and ldh implied a potential of liver and heart damage which was more common in severe and critical types currently there is no effective antiviral treatment for covid-19 20 in the light of the previous clinical experience interferon- lopinavirritonavir and arbidol were applied for antiviral therapy in our hospital however the therapeutic regimen was not researched a consensus among hospitals a retrospective study identified that proper use of corticosteroid in critical type with sars could lead to a lower mortality and shorter hospitalization stay 21 in our study the dosage of glucocorticoids was limited to 4080 mgd to avoid side effects until 12 february 2020 21 cases 404 of mild type 273 cases 415 of common type 27 cases 443 of severe type and 1 case 59 of critical type discharged from hospital compared with initial patients infected with sars-cov-2 in wuhan the illness condition of patients in zhejiang province are relatively milder none of the patients died at the end of our follow-up this feature is obviously different from researches in wuhan which reported a higher mortality 10 19 at early stage of outbreak of covid-19 in wuhan shortage of local medical resources insufficient understanding of this disease and no effective drugs might contribute to this phenomenon several risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with covid-19 were identified in our study including male fever cough hemoptysis gastrointestinal symptoms hypertension and higher age-grading several studies demonstrated that differences in covid-19 disease prevalence and severity were associated with sex which was similar to our results 3 6 19 one study using single-cell sequencing found that expression of ace2 was more predominant in asian men 22 during the evolution females develop enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses than males and are less susceptible to viral infections 23 these above two points might be the reasons for the higher prevalence and severity of covid-19 in men than in women additionally in our study the presence of any one of the comorbidities was higher in male compared with female 307 vs 244 p  0048 we thought this result might also partly explain why men are more prone to severity illness our study found increasing odds of the severity of illness was associated with gastrointestinal symptoms a bioinformatics analysis on single-cell transcriptomes demonstrated that ace2 was not only highly expressed in the lung at2 cells esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells but also in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon recently two independent laboratories from china declared that they have successfully isolated live sars-cov-2 from the stool of patients 24 an increasing number of studies remind us that digestive system might serve as an alternative route of infection for sars-cov-2 25 we consider the digestive tract transmission of sars-cov-2 might impair the function of intestinal mucosal barriers and increase the production of inflammatory factors further aggravating the severity of illness in addition covid-19 patients combined with hypertension were at higher risk for the illness severity in our study renin-angiotensin system ras plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension it could be simply summarized as two axes one is ace-ang ii-at1 axis responsible for constriction of blood vessels and the other is ace2-ang-17-mas axis with the opposite effect 26 27 generally the two axes could interact with each other and maintain the blood pressure balance however the balance would be broken in hypertension with the result of a lower expression of ace2 once infected by sars-cov-2 the level of ace2 would be even lower followed by intensified ang ii activity ang ii would further promote vasoconstriction increase vascular permeability and mediate inflammatory responses leading to illness aggravation there are several limitations in our study firstly the retrospective design of our study might affect integrality of data and diminish its credibility and more prospective cohort studies should be on the agenda in the future secondly patients enrolled in our study only come from zhejiang province and large-scale researches at the national level were urgently needed which could provide more reliable and comprehensive data thirdly changes of the illness in different subtypes needed to be further investigated a model for predicting the changes of disease was necessary for clinicians to better guide treatments moreover laboratory results were not included in ordinal logistic regression model to explore risk factors for the severity of illness due to the normal range of some indicators varied from different hospitals in summary our study reported the largest cases of patients with covid-19 in zhejiang province and indicated risk factors of illness severity which was of great significance for early identification and prompt treatment based on the research findings we recommend that clinicians should pay close attention to these features in patients with covid-19 including older age male fever cough hemoptysis gastrointestinal symptoms and hypertension and strengthen self-protection during the outbreak of covid-19  influenza and other emerging respiratory viruses maria zambon   transmission of infections between humans through a respiratory route is well established and dependent on pathogens being carried in secretions that are transmitted between individuals as aerosols droplets secretions or via direct mucosal contact viruses have adapted to the human population over many millennia1 and many have now evolved to exclusive transmission in humans through the respiratory route yet the disease they cause is not restricted to the respiratory system examples of viruses causing systemic disease transmitted through the respiratory route include measles and erythrovirus b19 other human viral infections cause respiratory system disease and transmit through respiratory secretions for example respiratory syncytial virus rsv rhinoviruses and human adapted strains of influenza a which cause seasonal epidemics and influenza b and c which are human pathogens the outcome of infection and clinical disease presentation is partly dependent on virus factors which restrict viral replication to certain cell types tissue tropism sporadic transmission of viruses from their natural animal host to humans can cause zoonotic infections with disease of varying severity and epidemic scale depending on the virus for many of these infections humans are dead-end hosts such infections are usually well recognized with effective control measures to limit human disease examples include rabies however new infectious agents of man are described at regular intervals for the last decade at least one significant new human pathogen has been identified almost every year involving a diversity of organisms the rate of identification of new viruses has increased in recent years with the application of genomics which has facilitated the detection of organisms that could not previously be cultivated table 1
2
 approximately 75 of all newly described human pathogens emerging diseases are rna viruses many of which are transmitted through a mucosal or respiratory route not all of these cause serious human infections some may be viruses that have been in the human population for decades or even centuries without an animal reservoir but through the application of improved diagnostic techniques are now recognized such as human metapneumovirus hmpv table 2
 other newly described infections may have emerged very recently into the human population as a result of a species jump such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv pandemic influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov such infections may first come to attention as a result of a severe undiagnosed respiratory illness or an unusual severe illness requiring critical care without obvious animal exposures and may be detected as a result of an astute clinician requesting detailed diagnostic testing to rule out known infections evaluating the importance of a newly emerging virus is dependent on understanding the host range disease and pathogenesis in man transmissibility and likelihood of sustained transmission in human population the term pandemic is usually taken to indicate a very widespread epidemic with an infection that has the capacity to cause disease on a global scale a new influenza a virus in the human population known as pandemic influenza has the greatest impact on human populations as a result of morbidity and mortality in all age groups2 but several other viruses such as sars coronavirus are also capable of causing significant clinical economic and financial impact on a global level figures 1 and 2
 in 2013 there is an unprecedented pandemic threat involving severe virus infections new to human populations two different viruses influenza a h7n93 and mers-cov4 circulating in different animal reservoirs in china and the arabian peninsula respectively have caused fatalities in humans and demonstrated limited human-to-human transmission through the respiratory route with potential to cause much more widespread disease the genetic characteristics of viruses that emerge to cause serious human respiratory disease with pandemic potential may be diverse influenza viruses have a segmented negative-sense genome of approximately 15 kb and exist as three different types a b and c influenza b and c which are well-recognized human respiratory pathogens have limited genetic diversity and are adapted to transmission exclusively in humans disease caused by influenza c is markedly milder than that caused by influenza a or b occasional transmission of influenza b to mammalian species such as seals and influenza c to pigs has been described in contrast there are many different subtypes of influenza a viruses all of which naturally infect water-based wild birds usually with very little disease2
 influenza a viruses have a broad host range with the potential to infect a wide range of animals figure 3
 influenza a viral subtypes are distinguished according to their surface proteins haemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na seventeen ha subtypes and nine na subtypes are found circulating in the wild giving rise to over 150 different subtype combinations there is great genetic diversity within influenza viruses in wild bird populations as a result of the ability of viruses to recombine segments not all different influenza a subtypes are established in man or mammalian hosts only a limited number of subtypes have adapted to circulation in mammalian species including humans horses and swine currently seasonal influenza a epidemics are caused by influenza a h1n1 or h3n2 which have adapted from the original avian host to transmit through respiratory secretions and cause respiratory tract infections in humans2
 avian influenza a subtypes are transmitted through a faeco-oral route and virus can be shed in high quantity in the environment following replication in the gastrointestinal tract in wild birds there is frequent spillover of avian influenza a subtypes into domestic poultry reservoirs as a result of shared habitats with wild birds replication in poultry may be associated with disease in poultry of varying severity or may be asymptomatic depending on the viral subtype and the poultry species domestic poultry may therefore act as a source of transmission of zoonotic influenza a subtypes to humans this has been demonstrated with h5n1 which is highly pathogenic in poultry and more recently with h7n9 which is less highly pathogenic in poultry2
 since march 2013 approximately 150 cases of human infection with influenza a h7n9 have been reported from eastern china the pathogenicity of the virus is high in humans and higher age appears to be a risk factor the median age of cases is 64 years with a range between 4 and 89 years approximately one-third of cases have been fatal to date there is currently no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission the latest epidemiological data are available from the who httpwwwwhointinfluenzahumananimalinterfaceinfluenzah7n9enindexhtml genetic analysis of a h7n9 isolates has identified mutations which suggests that the virus may have a greater ability to infect mammalian species including humans than most other avian influenza viruses small family clusters have been reported there is limited evidence for human-to-human transmission of this emerging influenza virus the source and mode of transmission of influenza a h7n9 have not yet been confirmed but most cases have reported contact with poultry or live animal markets5 6 7
 pigs are also considered a mixing vessel for the reassortment of avian swine and human influenza viruses until the 1990s classic swine influenza a h1n1 the most commonly circulating swine influenza virus among pigs remained fairly constant however by the late 1990s different subtypes h1n1 h3n2 and h1n2 had emerged and became predominant among north american pig herds these swine influenza a viruses acquired avian human and swine virus gene segments through reassortment and various genetic lineages can be distinguished within each subtype in europe swine influenza is caused primarily by the same subtypes however the antigenic and genetic characteristics differ significantly from those found in north america and asia genetic diversity has been expanded through multiple introductions of influenza viruses from other animal hosts into pig herds including from humans most recently demonstrated with h1n1 pdm 2009 virus in europe asia and the americas2
 recent events confirm the important role of swine in the emergence of novel influenza viruses capable of causing a human pandemic with the emergence of h1n1 pdm 2009 from a swine reservoir in north america this h1n1 was sufficiently different from seasonal h1n1 previously circulating since 1977 to show sustained transmission in humans and eventually to replace the previously circulating h1n1 variant since 2009 other variant influenza h1n1 and h3n2 viruses circulating in the swine population of north america have also emerged to cause sporadic infections8
 seasonal influenza a and b illness in humans ranges from subclinical or mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to more severe illness including laryngotracheitis and pneumonia or less commonly death from respiratory system failure the most common presenting symptoms are cough high temperature joint pain and general malaise the rapid onset and short incubation period are characteristic though incubation can last up to 4 days individuals at greatest risk of complications are those with pre-existing cardiac and respiratory disease the elderly and those with impaired immunity the severity of illness reflects pre-existing host immunity and the prevailing virus strain2
 disease caused by pandemic influenza a in 2009 was considered to be of moderate severity with a similar range of presentation to that of seasonal influenza a including typical symptoms of fever cough and sore throat younger people were more commonly affected particularly for fatal or severe disease this is in stark contrast to seasonal influenza which generally has a more severe impact on the elderly over 65 years population severe respiratory failure is seen in a small proportion of cases with certain underlying medical conditions posing an increased risk of severe or fatal disease with an increased risk of complications in pregnancy2
 disease caused by novel swine variants of influenza arising from circulating viruses in swine populations is largely indistinguishable clinically from seasonal influenza but the mean age of presentation occurs in the young population under 16 years with an exposure history to swine9
 disease presentation following zoonotic infection with these avian subtypes of influenza tends to be more severe with a longer prodrome often the presentation may be that of a viral pneumonia without the prominent features of cough and upper respiratory tract syndromes with rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards following zoonotic transmission of non-human subtypes of influenza a to humans viral receptors and replication competence will affect the tropism of the virus and the tissues and body fluids in which the virus may be detected as has been demonstrated for h5n1 and h7 viruses in this situation a broad range of tissues may yield infectious virus recovery and a different spectrum of illness in contrast to seasonal influenza virus infection this would include evidence of leucopenia at presentation which is not a typical feature of seasonal influenza a history of exposure to poultry with recent travel to parts of the world where avian influenza is endemic may be an important diagnostic clue also conjunctivitis has been a clinical presenting feature associated with h7 infections involving h7n7 h7n2 and h7n3 but does not seem to have featured in h7n9 infections9
 an influenza pandemic poses a significant risk to human health and spreads rapidly around the globe as was seen in 2009 every attempt is made to ensure that influenza viruses with pandemic potential are controlled in their animal reservoirs but once a new variant has emerged into the population several countermeasures are undertaken in order to pose a pandemic threat a novel influenza virus or any other virus with pandemic potential must satisfy two separate criteria first the virus itself must be capable of efficient transmission between humans and second the virus must be antigenically novel such that a large proportion of the population are serologically nave and fully susceptible to infection and so will support its onward transmission the presence of a large mobile animal reservoir of influenza a virus suggests that eradication of this agent will be impossible control strategies focus on limiting the opportunities for cross-species transmission of novel subtypes for examplehousing domestic poultry in shelters to avoid contact with migratorywild birds improving biosecurityeliminatingreducing live bird marketshousing aquatic birds and domestic poultry separatelyslaughtering flocks infected with avian influenza h5 and h7raising awareness of potential for acquisition of influenza from swine
 these measures may achieve some success in prevention of zoonotic transmission of influenza a to humans but have little impact on its annual cycle in humans unprecedented levels of h5 and h7 circulating in south east asia and elsewhere present a high risk for emergence of a novel pandemic influenza a strain particularly as it is recognized that relatively few mutations are required to alter the transmission characteristics of avian viruses to those more adapted to respiratory transmission in humans the mainstay of control of influenza is vaccination the basis of vaccination against influenza is the observation that infection with influenza generates neutralizing antibodies to the viral surface proteins predominantly ha these antibodies will protect against infection with the same strain of influenza and may give limited protection against closely related strains vaccines used in humans are designed to elicit high levels of antibody to viral ha protein the more distant an influenza virus the less protective the antibodies generated by natural immunity or vaccination will be as human influenza drift variants arise frequently it is necessary to update vaccines on a regular basis influenza vaccines are given annually before the influenza season so that those with the highest risk factor may benefit from boosted immunity in developed countries there has been an expansion of vaccination policies to ensure that individuals aged over 65 are vaccinated irrespective of pre-existing illness and every effort is made to target those with risk factors in younger age groups vaccination rates vary considerably between developed countries and between the developed and the developing world in 2013 for the first time in the uk live attenuated vaccines laiv will be used to vaccinate children over 2 years and under 16 years laiv are particularly suitable for children as they can be given intranasally without the use of needles the vaccines undergo limited replication in the nasal cavity and induce both humoral and cellular immunity which is more broadly protective vaccines used for seasonal vaccination of older adults and elderly are subunit-inactivated vaccines that do not replicate they are intended to boost pre-existing immunity to reduce the likelihood of severe infection there are no widely available vaccines for h7 or h5 influenza and although there have been several clinical trials of vaccines against h5 these viral targets are not included in seasonal vaccines despite the protective efficacy of vaccination the need for treatment of severe influenza remains particularly in the case of zoonotic infections na inhibitors nis are the most widely used class of anti-influenza compounds they act on the viral surface protein na prevent release of viral particles from infected cells and are most effective when given early in illness use in the pandemic of 2009 has confirmed that when given early during illness drugs can prevent severe outcomes death and critical care hospitalization and may also have benefit in severe infection even if given late10 in the uk in 2000 the national institute for health and care excellence nice has recommended that ni drugs may be used for prophylaxis and treatment with certain restrictions other anti-influenza drugs that target other viral proteins such as polymerase are being progressed through drug development pipelines when such drugs are licensed they will enhance the ability to treat infections and avoid the emergence of drug resistance that occurs in the severely immunocompromised host and with higher frequency in treated children in immunocompromised individuals influenza a replicates to high viral load in the absence of immune responses and infection may become persistent giving prolonged shedding of unusual drug-resistant variants that are difficult to treat intravenous immunoglobulin usually contains high levels of neutralizing antibody to influenza and may be useful in treating severely immunocompromised individuals who are unable to clear seasonal influenza infections children may be more likely to generate resistant viruses following treatment as a result of higher viral shedding in the absence of pre existing immunity the emergence of drug-resistant influenza is dependent on drug viral and host factors viral factors include the na subtype of influenza with n1-containing viruses more likely to sustain the mutations in viral na to inhibit drug binding and thereby generate resistance compared with n2-containing viruses the most commonly described mutation associated with na drug resistance is the histidine-to-tyrosine shift h275y seen in h1n1 or h5n1 viruses which reduces oseltamivir susceptibility by over 600-fold this is associated with clinical resistance to drug however even when resistant virus emerges in an individual during the course of treatment as a species detectable towards the end of a treatment course it may not have any clinical consequence for the individual in whom resistance is detected if that individual is immunologically normal or the infection is with seasonal influenza the ability of drug-resistant influenza to transmit occurred during 20072008 with seasonal h1n1 although this virus has now been replaced with pandemic h1n1 which remains sensitive to oseltamivir11
 individuals with a compromised immune system are more likely to generate drug-resistant variants and require additional therapy with drugs directed at alternative targets or the use of immunotherapy there is increasing interest in combination therapies with some of the unlicensed alternative antiviral drugs polymerase inhibitors or diverse neuraminidase inhibitors that are given intravenously which may have a slightly different resistance profile coronaviruses have a large positive-sense segmented rna genome of approximately 30 kb and infect a diverse range of animals including domestic and companion animals of man it is considered most likely that coronaviruses in these animals originated from a bat reservoir and became established in many secondary hosts coronaviruses show great adaptability in host range and as a result can establish and sustain in a wide range of species infections that may then spillover into man this was seen in 2003 with sars being transmitted from civet cats which were a permissive secondary host since the identification of sars in 200312 several other new respiratory coronaviruses of humans have been identified including nl63 and hku1 virus these are in addition to known human coronaviruses oc43 and 229e which have been recognized as a source of milder respiratory infections in humans for several decades as a result of sars much greater attention has been given to this group of viruses generally with the result that many new viruses in animals have also been identified coronaviruses group genetically into four major groups with human viruses found in three of the four major groups although the greatest diversity of coronaviruses is found in bats13
 the first indication of a new viral infection in humans was the detection of clusters of illness in south east asia this virus spread worldwide in early 2003 with over 8000 cases and approximately 10 fatalities before the disease was brought under control through application of public health control measures such as quarantine of infected individuals and strict infection control in hospital settings risk factors for sars wereclose contact with civet catseatingpreparing civet meatlaboratory work with sarscontact with a known case

multiplex real-time pcr assays for the detection of respiratory viruses with influenza a virus subtyping jaehyeon lee hye lee soo yong cho gon sam choi im dal kim sik   detecting pathogens in respiratory infections is crucial for diagnosis patient management and to avoid improper antibiotic treatment and unnecessary laboratory testing however the gold-standard methods for detecting viral infections non-molecular methods have critical limitations such as the requirement of labor-intensive and complex procedures and time-consuming steps 12 therefore in many instances cell culture is no longer considered the gold-standard method and molecular assays have become the standard of care for diagnosis 13 multiplex real-time pcr is useful for diagnosing respiratory viral infections because the process time is faster than that of viral culture it detects multiple pathogenic viruses simultaneously and it is reliable 3 the allplex respiratory panel 123 all16 seegene seoul republic of korea which detects 16 respiratory viruses simultaneously with influenza a virus flua subtyping represents the first clinical assay based on multiple detection temperature mudt which enables the detection of multiple targets in single-channel multiplexing without melting curve analysis via real-time pcr 4 it covers adenovirus adv coronavirus 229e 229e coronavirus nl63 nl63 and coronavirus oc43 oc43 flua and influenza b virus flub human bocavirus 1234 hbov human enterovirus hev human metapneumovirus mpv human rhinovirus abc hrv parainfluenza virus 1 piv1 parainfluenza virus 2 piv2 parainfluenza virus 3 piv3 and parainfluenza virus 4 piv4 and respiratory syncytial virus a rsva and respiratory syncytial virus b rsvb additionally it is a one-step pcr assay and is therefore much simpler than other commercial multiplex pcr assays for respiratory viruses thus we evaluated the performance of all16 compared with anyplex ii rv16 any16 seegene which also detects 16 viruses without flua subtyping additionally we analyzed the test time and hands-on time from the start of nucleic acid extraction until result acquisition we examined 426 nasopharyngeal swab samples submitted for respiratory multiplex pcr in chonbuk national university hospital korea for comparison with any16 250 samples showing negative results and 150 samples showing positive results in any16 totaling 400 consecutive clinical samples from january to june 2016 were tested except samples with insufficient volume for further evaluation of flua subtyping 26 more samples with flua positivity by any16 from january to february 2017 were tested all samples including 226 pediatric samples and 174 adult samples median patient age 7 years range 01-94 years were nasopharyngeal swabs enat copan brescia italy nucleic acids were extracted and prepared for pcr using the starmag 488 virus cartridge kit seegene and microlab nimbus ivd hamilton reno nv usa all samples were first tested with any16 followed by all16 according to the manufacturers instructions samples showing discrepancies between the two tests were further analyzed using monoplex real-time reverse transcription-pcr rt-pcr with the same primer pairs as for all16 and any16 and the flua genotyping results of all16 were compared with hemagglutinin gene sequencing results flua subtyping results of the 26 samples with flua positivity in all16 were compared with the results of the biofire filmarray respiratory panel filmarray biofire diagnostics salt lake city ut usa we also evaluated cross-reactivity with 24 common respiratory pathogens received from the chonbuk national university hospital branch of the national culture collection for pathogens see supplemental table s1 the mean test time and hands-on time from the start of nucleic acid extraction until result acquisition were compared statistical analyses were conducted using microsoft excel 2010 with analyse-it ver 465 analyse-it software ltd leeds uk inter-rater agreement statistics kappa values were obtained to compare the detection of respiratory viruses between all16 and any16 and we analyzed the sensitivity and specificity based on the monoplex pcr results this study was exempted by the institutional review board of chonbuk national university hospital irb no cuh 2015-11-029 with low ethical load not specifying the request of informed consent to the patient because all the studies were done after data was anonymized a total of 256 and 250 samples were positive in all16 and any16 respectively when a sample was positive for more than one virus regardless of the virus type or discrepancy the positive percent agreement between all16 and any16 was 932 95 confidence interval ci 894957 and the negative percent agreement was 847 95 ci 780896 the kappa value for the two methods was 078 95 ci 072085 results for each virus are summarized in table 1 eighteen samples in all16 were found to be h1 or h3 14 and 4 samples respectively by flua subtyping and these results were consistent with the sequencing results targeting the hemagglutinin gene of flua further comparison of flua subtyping with the filmarray findings showed consistent results for another 26 samples with h3 subtyping seventy-four samples showed discrepant results between the two assays and 68 discrepant samples showed positive results with only one method two samples showed discrepancies between the two methods and the results for four samples were completely different between the assays for further analysis we performed monoplex real-time rt-pcr for samples with discrepant results specifically all16-positive and any16-negative samples this analysis yielded 836 4655 consistency with the all16 results for samples with discrepancies involving all16 negativity and any16 positivity rate of consistency with the any16 results was 346 926 the discrepancies for each virus are described in table 2 additionally we analyzed the sensitivity and sensitivity of each assay after resolving discrepant results table 3 the analytical specificity test of all16 for 24 bacteria showed all negative results when 28 samples were analyzed simultaneously the test time and hands-on time showed mean times of 43 and 05 hour respectively the mean times required for dna extraction and pcr preparation using microlab nimbus ivd and pcr itself were 24 and 19 hours respectively and both analyses required less time than any16 both multiplex rt-pcr assays all16 and any16 are based on tagging oligonucleotide cleavage and extension technology but all16 utilizes mudt technology multiplex real-time pcr typically requires either multiple fluorescence channels or a melting curve analysis step after amplification 56 the mudt technology saves time because the melting curve analysis step is unnecessary a 22-hour reduction in the test time for all16 is achieved regardless of the sample number compared with any16 this finding reflects the application of mudt and a one-step process including pcr and cdna synthesis in all16 compared with the two-step analysis including pcr amplification after cdna synthesis used in any16 reduction of the hands-on time workload and test time because of the simple one-step analysis with mudt used in all16 is helpful in clinical laboratories results obtained using the newly developed all16 test showed good agreement with any16 results for each virus the positive and negative percent agreement showed good results however slight discrepancies were observed for hev and piv3 discrepancies in hev results might reflect low viral loads or primer competition any16 detected more positive results for hev than that by all16 the analytical sensitivity of all16 is reported as 50 copiesl except for when piv1 is analyzed yielding a sensitivity of 10 copiesreaction and when piv4 and mpv are analyzed with a sensitivity of 103 copiesreaction 7 in contrast the sensitivity of any16 under the same conditions is approximately 6 copiesl 8 based on the manufacturers package inserts the analytical sensitivities of any16 and all16 are 50 copiesreaction and 100 copiesreaction respectively therefore hev results were consistent with the package inserts additionally any16 involves a two-step analysis with pcr following cdna synthesis separation of the cdna synthesis step from pcr might have influenced hev rna purity or extraction but other rna virus results were inconsistent with this therefore we speculate that the results were likely due to primer competition hrv results from all16 were more sensitive and specific than results from any16 in this study discrepancies in results were likely due to broader primer coverage for various hrv genotypes according to the primer information provided by the manufacturer data not shown regarding piv3 all16 showed more positive cases than any16 and most discrepant results were confirmed as positive 96 2627 via monoplex pcr in this respect any16 might miss many cases of piv3 which infects the distal airways and causes pneumonia and bronchiolitis 910 further studies on the detection and clinical investigations of hev and piv3 infections should be conducted recently flua subtyping has become more important because of the emergence of avian and swine flua 11 however there are few relevant clinically available assays we observed good agreement on flua subtyping results between all16 and filmarray since rapid reporting of viral diseases is critical rapid pcr assays have been introduced but these assays have limited throughput however according to our analysis all16 can be performed twice per day without requiring more workers therefore if many samples need to be run all16 could be advantageous especially compared with any16 the present study has certain limitations some samples contained viruses at low titers hindering statistical analyses for certain viruses such as piv1 and piv4 and could not reflect the entire range of seasonal variations in each viral infection in conclusion all16 showed good agreement with any16 its flua subtyping and reduced test time and workload are useful in clinical laboratories however further investigations such as clinical studies of analyses of hev and piv3 are needed  is there a need for improved cryptosporidium diagnostics in swedish calves c silverls h bosaeus-reineck k nslund c

cryptosporidium spp are ubiquitous protozoan parasites of vertebrates globally the zoonotic species cryptosporidium parvum is a common species in and a cause of diarrhoea in preweaned calves infection is most prevalent between 1and 3 weeks of age nydam et al 2001 santn and trout 2008 and related symptoms are watery diarrhoea inappetence depression and sometimes death santn and trout 2008 calf diarrhoea is a multifactorial disease and co-infection with other pathogens or the presence of non-infectious diarrhoeal causes can lead to more severe disease and higher mortality rates traditionally c parvum has been diagnosed by microscopy of faecal smears or concentrated samples with or without staining however two other species cryptosporidium bovis and cryptosporidium ryanae with an oocystmorphology which is similar to c parvum can be identified in cattle using dna analysis differentiation between these three species cannot be made by microscopy cryptosporidium bovis and c ryanae are considered to be a pathogenic and are most prevalent after 12 months of age santn et al 2004 fayer et al 2006 fayer et al 2007 langkjaer et al 2006 but possible pathogenic effects of c bovis on cryptosporidium nave calves have not been investigated cryptosporidium parvum has been identified as the main species in young calves responsible for 80 of cryptosporidium infections santn et al 2004 trotz-williams et al 2006 fayer et al 2007 plutzer and karanis 2007 broglia et al 2008 brook et al 2009 however in sweden and some other countries c bovis is the most prevalent species in preweaned calves silverls 2010 wang et al 2011 budu-amoako et al 2012 silverls and blanco-penedo 2012 in sweden c bovis constituted 50 of the infections during the second week of life and was the most common species from 2 weeks of age the species was also detected in a number of diarrhoeal calf samples silverls et al 2010a silverls et al 2010b cryptosporidium analysis has been offered as a part of routine diagnostic services of diarrhoeal calf faecal samples at the swedish national veterinary institute sva for many years but diagnostic procedures do not include species determination if the cryptosporidium spp distribution in diarrhoeal calves is the same as in swedish dairy calves in general ie there is a high c bovis prevalence species determination should be included in routine diagnostic procedures in order to make it possible to estimate the clinical relevance of cryptosporidium infection the first aim of this study was to determine whether cryptosporidium routine diagnostic procedures need to be supplemented with cryptosporidium spp analysis a second aim was to investigate the spectrum of c parvum subtypes present in herds with diarrhoeal problems and whether any subtype seems to be associated with more severe symptoms finally the presence of other pathogens and characterisation of the clinical picture at sample and herd levels were investigated and related to cryptosporidium infection kalvpaketet is a service package offered to farmers by the swedish animal health services svenska djurhlsovrden ab sweden the package includes sampling laboratory analysis and advice for herds with diarrhoeal or respiratory disease problems in young calves samples are collected by veterinarians in the field and analysed at sva uppsala sweden submissions can comprise up to five diarrhoeal samples or nasal swabs from diseased calves and blood samples from up to five healthy 1- to 7-day-old calves all faecal and blood samples sent via kalvpaketet from herds asking for cryptosporidium analysis from 30 march 2010 to 29 march 2012were included in this study as soon as samples arrived at sva a questionnaire asking about calf management and the clinical

calves should be noted on the referral infection is usualy diagnosed by direct microscopy after immunofluorescent staining the presence of eimeria spp is analysed in calves 3 weeks of age by the macmaster flotation method the presence of e coli f5 is analysed in calves 2 weeks of age by cultivation on blood agar plates followed by agglutination of one to two representative colonies to determine whether they are f5 for rotavirus bcv and salmonella analyses up to five diarrhoeal samples per herd are pooled at the laboratory and analyses are thus performed at herd level rotavirus is detected by antigen-elisa coronavirus by pcr and salmonella by cultivation on specific agars tp is analysed by refractometry faecal consistency and colour was registered on arrival or samples at sva samples diagnosed as cryptosporidium-positive by routine diagnostic methods were further analysed to verify the presence of cryptosporidium and determine the oocyst count cryptosporidium sp and subtype one gram of each cryptosporidium-positive faecal sample was cleaned and concentrated by sodium chloride flotation silverls et al 2009 within 1 week of arrival at the laboratory out of the final 15 ml volume a subsample of 30 l was used to determine the oocyst count oocysts were enumerated at 200 magnification by epifluorescence microscopy after staining with fitc-labelled monoclonal anti-cryptosporidium antibodies cryptocel if test kit cellabs australia the entire 30 l sub-sample was examined if there were 6 oocysts per field of vision 1000 per 30 l if there were 6 oocysts per

versus median 0 range 020 n  10 mw  18 p  007 there were no observations on rehydration rates for the herds with mixed iiaiid sfs the most prominent finding was that c parvum is the dominant species in diarrhoeal calf samples from herds with calf diarrhoeal problems the dominance of c parvum in cryptosporidium-positive samples found here is in contrast to the results of our previous studies where this species was only identified in 20 of samples from preweaned calves silverls 2010 however that study material was based on a random selection of dairy herds in sweden giving an estimate of species distribution in the average dairy herd and calf in the current material only diarrhoeal samples from herds with diarrhoeal problems were included and species distribution was similar to what has been reported from other countries santn et al 2004 langkjaer et al 2006 trotz-williams et al 2006 plutzer and karanis 2007 thompson et al 2007 the fact that c parvum-infected calves were younger than c bovis-infected calves indicates that in herds harbouring c parvum this is the primary species infecting newborn calves or that if infection occurs at approximately the same time in cryptosporidium nave calves c parvum will conquer c bovis cryptosporidium parvum was not identified by ssrrna sequencing after 42 days of age and could only be detected as a minor species in older calves up to 75 days of age by ssrrna-rflp or gp60 analysis of c bovis positive-samples age can thus be used to estimate clinical relevance and it seems that cryptosporidium analysis is not relevant in diarrhoeal calves older than 6 weeks the cut-off currently used is 2 months of age in epidemiological studies species determination is still an important tool because species cannot be determined by microscopy and species distribution obviously differs with each study population because c parvum is pathogenic on its own co-infection with other pathogens were only analysed at an individual level for calves infected with the considered apathogenic c bovis the presence of c bovis without co-infection with other pathogens in six diarrhoeal samples indicates that this species also has pathogenic potential kalvpaketet analyses are primarily important to determine pathogen and tp statuses at herd level and thus multiple infections at herd level were investigated to see whether cryptosporidium infection alone was a common cause of diarrhoeal problems the identification of up to four other pathogens in most herds with cryptosporidium infections confirms the complex aetiology of diarrhoeal disease and this has to be taken into consideration when dealing with diarrhoeal problems calves with a tp of 55 gl are considered to have sufficient passive transfer radostits om 2000 the principles of control of infectious diseases of calves under 30 days of age in proceedings from the xxi world buiatrics congress in punta del este uruguay 48 december our results thus indicate that failure of passive transfer could be a part of the herds problems because half of the calves and herds fell below that level oocyst counts in individual samples taken at a single point in infection are affected by when in the course of infection a sample is taken because excretion rates will follow a bell shaped curve over time nydam et al 2001 however when looking at a large sample size these effects are hopefully distributed evenly in the material and oocyst counts could provide a measure of pathogenicity santn and trout 2008 indeed c parvum-positive samples had significantly higher oocyst counts than c bovis-positive samples the yellow faecal colour associated with c parvum infection could reflect the time period when calves are infected  ie when milk is their dominant feed source but yellow watery faeces has previously been associated with cryptosporidium infection sanford and josephson 1982 faecal colour changes as the proportion of haysilage and grain in the feed increases thus brown or other colours than yellow would be more common in diarrhoeal samples from older calves as was the case for c bovis-positive samples there are a high number of c parvum subtypes determined by differences in the gp60 gene and new ones are frequently reported in this study we identified 27 subtypes of which 16 have not been reported previously with three exceptions only one subtype was present per herd this indicates a stable within herd clonal pattern in the c parvum population similar patterns have been identified in areas with closed herd management misic et al 2006 thompson et al 2007 brook et al 2008 soba and logar 2008 in areas with animal exchange between herds fewer subtypes but two or more subtypes per herd is a common pattern peng et al 2003 trotz-williams et al 2006 brook et al 2008 sweden generally has closed herd management with the exception of fattening herds where calves are bought from different herds from about 2 weeks of age it is thus not surprising that one of the herds with two subtypes was a fattening herd the identification of two subtypes in a dairy herd is however unexpected if animal exchange occurs in dairy herds moved animals are usually heifers or cows where c parvum infection is not likely to be present silverls et al 2010a silverls et al 2010b however dairy herd size is increasing in sweden and thus animal exchange is likely to increase which could affect the subtype clonality of c parvum in the future the predominance of gp60 sf iia could reflect a higher pathogenicity or simply better host adaptation in line with the results of this study sf iia has been predominant in ruminants and humans in other studies from around the world alves et al 2003 alves et al 2006 peng et al 2003 wu et al 2003 misic et al 2006 trotz-williams et al 2006 thompson et al 2007 xiao et al 2007 silverls 2010 a difference in pathogenicity between sfs has been identified for cryptosporidium hominis where sf id but not sfs ia ib or ie was associated with diarrhoea cama et al 2007 in the present study c parvum sf iia had a significant association with watery faeces compared with sf iid there was also a tendency towards a higher oocyst count for sf iia for the gp60 locus no universal cryptosporidium primer as for the ssrrna locus exists and the primers used to subtype c parvum and c hominis fails to replicate most other species thus the presence of c parvum subtypes in five c bovis samples indicated co-infection with c parvum this was investigated further by ssrrna-rflp of all c bovis samples at the end of the study period indeed mixed infection was confirmed in these five samples as well as in two samples negative at the gp60 locus interestingly two of the mixed samples contained other subtypes both new than the c parvum samples of those herds this could indicate that c bovis subtypes can sometimes be identified using the c parvumc hominis primers as is the case for cryptosporidium meleagridis glaberman et al 2001 abe 2010 it could be argued that samples with mixed c bovisc parvum should have been considered a separate group in our statistical analyses they were put in the c bovis group for three reasons first c bovis was the dominant species as shown by ssrrna sequencing second it is not known whether c bovis was a minor species in any of the c parvum samples because rflp was not performed and thus the c parvum group could include mixed samples as well third a subgroup analysis of age and oocyst counts showed that the mixed samples belonged to the c bovis group data not shown our extended analysis method with concentration and cleaning of samples can detect oocysts at shedding rates of 50100 opg andersson 2004 cryptosporidium infection in cattle  evaluation of a new method for identification of subclinical infection in swedish english summary master of veterinary medicine thesis swedish university of agricultural sciences uppsala sweden the sensitivity of the method used in routine diagnostic procedures has not been established but our results show that it is less sensitive than our concentration method in addition the skills of the person performing the analysis will affect the result at routine diagnostic services several persons are involved in analysis whereas in the extended analysis performed here all samples were analysed by the same person producing a more consistent result these are the reasons why samples positive by routine diagnostic methods but negative after concentration and cleaning were considered false positives however the routine diagnostic method is obviously sensitive enough to evaluate clinically relevant samples in conclusion c parvum is the dominant cryptosporidium spin diseased calves in diarrhoeal problem herds in contrast to the average species distribution in swedish preweaned calves thus species determination does not need to be included in routine cryptosporidium diagnostic procedures in order to estimate the clinical relevance if this parasite genus is found in samples from diarrhoeal herds the dominance of c parvum especially during the period when clinical cryptosporidiosis is most common and higher oocyst counts supports that this species is more pathogenic than c bovis however the possible pathogenic potential of c bovis warrants further attention the age span when analysis for clinical cryptosporidiosis is performed could be shortened from 2 months to 6 weeks of age  rapid and simple colorimetric detection of multiple influenza viruses infecting humans using a reverse transcriptional loop-mediated isothermal

si seung hong bok kyeong shin seob sungkun chun young choi ki min-suk song   the world health organization constantly monitors global influenza activity it has noted global circulation of h1n1 h3n2 and two lineages of type b victoria- and yamagata- viruses that cause 670000 annual deaths worldwide 1 in the past few years human infections with several subtypes of avian influenza virus aiv eg h5 and h7 occurred sporadically 2 highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai h5n1 and h5n6 viruses have infected 878 humans with 53 mortality since 1997 3 since the first case of human infection with low pathogenic avian influenza lpai h7n9 virus reported in china in 2013 the number of humans infected with this virus has dramatically increased to more than 1567 as of april 2019 4 recognizing this public concern it is important to distinguish seasonal influenza and avian influenza viruses such as h5 and h7n9 that occur simultaneously in humans especially in china vaccination and treatment with antiviral drugs eg neuraminidase inhibitors nais are primary interventions to prevent viral infections and their spread however vaccine production usually takes 612 months to prepare for newly emerging viruses nais also should be taken within the first 48 h following an infection 5 thus rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections is important for mitigating the spread of virus within a community facilitating immediate treatment with nais and controlling carriers of these pathogens methods to detect and identify influenza viruses have improved over the past decades ranging from traditional virus culture 6 to introduction of serological and molecular diagnostic technology eg real-time rt-pcr 7 and pcr 8 and more recently rapid influenza detection tests ridt 911 with various influenza-specific diagnostic tools selecting the most appropriate approach is based on a number of factors including sensitivity specificity throughput cost and availability 12 virus isolation and serology method has traditionally been used to detect influenza virus however it may take several days to obtain results 13 ridt is a rapid method of performing point-of-care testing poct in the field most ridt diagnostic kits can detect influenza nucleoprotein antigen 14 however ridt has two potential limitations i relatively large numbers of influenza viruses must be present for accurate detection in the collected sample and ii inability to distinguish between influenza subtypes overall sensitivity and accuracy of ridt are lower than those of qrt-pcr-based methods that not only can amplify small amounts of target viral rna but also can allow for determination of influenza a virus subtype using specifically designed primers 12 despite qrt-pcr-based approaches have these advantages they typically take at least a few hours up to 2 days to obtain results 15 in addition qrt-pcr needs trained personnel and sophisticated facilities for sample processing these disadvantages limit its function in ensuring rapid prescription and administration of antiviral agents to patients recently many clinical laboratory improvement amendments clia-waived molecular tests have been approved for point-of-care use httpswwwcdcgovfluprofessionalsdiagnosismolecular-assayshtm although the detection time similar to ridt and sensitivity better than ridt of clia-waived molecular tests have been improved they are mostly limited to seasonal flu detection they are incapable of discriminating seasonal influenza of avian subtypes that can cause human infection 16 loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp assays can amplify specific nucleic acids at a consistent temperature they have been used for rapid detection of specific genes 1720 in particular lamp method combined with reverse transcription called rt-lamp is a method for simultaneously synthesizing cdna from template rna and amplifying dna 21 thus rt-lamp is useful for detecting rna viruses in addition polymerase enzyme produces protons and subsequently leads to decreased ph in the presence of extensive dna polymerase activity during lamp reaction thus facilitating real-time and simple detection of amplicons as observed by a change from pink to yellow color in the reaction solution 22 the specificity and sensitivity of rt-lamp are potentially comparable to those of existing pcr-based diagnostics with much shorter reaction time recently influenza diagnostics tools leveraging rt-lamp technology have been reported 2330 however most of these tools can only diagnose a single or a small number of human influenza viruses their ability to diagnose newly emerging viruses is limited none of these methods can simultaneously differentiate infection of seasonal influenza from multiple avian influenza virus infection including recently emerging h5nx and h7n9 although this is critical when infection by those viruses to humans simultaneously occurs thus the objective of this study was to develop a multiplex rt-lamp diagnostic method capable of simultaneously detecting human influenza viruses two lineages of type b h1n1 and h3n2 currently circulating in humans and avian influenza viruses h5n1 h5n6 and h7n9 in rapidly emerging human infections this assay also involves a one-pot colorimetric visualization approach that allows for direct observation by the naked eye overall this diagnostic

were successfully amplified using these designed rt-lamp primers and observed by color changes within rt-lamp reaction tubes fig 2a a change in color from pink to light yellow indicated a positive reaction while negative reactions retained a pink color fig 2 the specificity of these rt-lamp primers was additionally verified using mixed virus samples in various combinations targeted genes in mixed virus samples were also specifically amplified by rt-lamp primers fig 2b in addition agarose gel electrophoresis of rt-lamp products showed a typical ladder-like banding pattern additional file 1 figure s1 these results indicate that multiplex rt-lamp primers described here can efficiently and specifically detect corresponding subtypes they can also detect multiple human influenza virus genes as a universal element in this rt-lamp assay to determine the detection limit of the multiplex rt-lamp assay for human influenza viruses and avian influenza viruses infecting humans we performed amplification of endpoint-diluted viral rna extracted from each virus after propagation in 11-day-old chicken embryonic eggs for 4872 h at 33 c for type b viruses and 37 c for type a viruses rna of each virus was serially diluted 10-fold up to 10 6 in distilled water dw infectious viral particles were determined using tcid50ml infectious viral genome copies per microliter of extracted rna were estimated and presented in table 2 as shown in table 2 and additional file 1 figure s2 the multiplex rt-lamp assay revealed a detection limit range of 01  100 viral genome copies p  005 for all human influenza viruses and avian influenza viruses infecting humans in our panel ie type b victoria- and yamagata-lineages seasonal h1n1 h3n2 highly pathogenic avian influenza h5n1 h5n6 and h5n8 isolated

genome copies for the same viral rna samples table 2 and additional file 1 figure s2 total reaction and observation time of conventional pcr-based detection methods took 23 h while colorimetric visualization of multiplex rt-lamp assay results took only 1 h overall these results demonstrate that the multiplex rt-lamp assay developed in this study targeting ha or na gene of influenza viruses exhibits similar or higher sensitivity with reduced detection time compared to conventional pcr-based assays we also examined the specificity of the multiplex rt-lamp assay using other subtypes of

viruses demonstrated no cross-reactivity with other influenza subtypes or human infectious viruses tested fig 3 and table 3 conventional rt-pcr and qrt-pcr assays using specific primers additional file 1 table s1 for other influenza subtypes and human infectious viruses were also performed to verify the presence of corresponding viral rna target gene amplification was observed fig 3 and table 3 these results indicate that the rt-lamp assay can specifically detect influenza viruses tested in the current study a total of 73 clinical samples h1n1 n  3 h3n2 n  35 and type b n  35 and 18 spiked h1n1 n  9 h5n6 n  4 h5n8 n  4 and h7n9 n  1 samples initially diagnosed with influenza using qrt-pcr ct values 1713499 were clinically evaluated using the multiplex rt-lamp assay developed in this study for comparison conventional rt-pcr was performed in parallel results showed that 97100 of seasonal influenza viruses were specifically detected by the multiplex rt-lamp which exhibited similar sensitivity to qrt-pcr 35 out of 35 samples in type b 100 12 out of 12 samples in h1n1 100 and 34 out of 35 samples in h3n2 97 without cross-reaction to each other table 4 in addition 100 of h5n6 h5n8 and h7n9 samples were detectable using this developed rt-lamp assay however 83100 of influenza viruses in clinical and spiked samples were detected using conventional rt-pcr showing greater that 6 reduction in sensitivity compared to the rt-lamp assay table 4 these results suggest that the multiplex rt-lamp diagnostic assay described in this study is as sensitive as qrt-pcr however it provides results more rapidly with greater simplicity influenza virus an acute respiratory infectious agent can rapidly propagate in the upper respiratory tract it is capable of airborne transmission to other individuals 33 prescribing anti-influenza drugs following rapid and accurate diagnosis of an infection is thus critical to mitigate viral spread in the early stage of an outbreak many primary care providers use ridt to diagnose influenza infections because it is simple to use with relatively rapid results however the accuracy of this approach is lower than that of qrt-pcr a highly accurate gene-based diagnostic assay would serve as a valuable local on-site tool if it is easy to use with rapid results although many clia-waived molecular tests satisfy these criteria due to recent advancement most of these developed tests are limited to detect seasonal influenza without appropriate subtype discrimination in this study we developed a multiplex rt-lamp method to distinctively diagnose human influenza eg seasonal influenza type b h1n1 h3n2 and avian influenza viruses infecting humans eg h5n1 h5n6 and h7n9 hence this developed method would be essential in some countries where these viruses are co-circulating in humans moreover the rt-lamp method described here can be used to intuitively detect these viruses using a one-pot colorimetric visualization approach making it a more feasible poct our multiplex rt-lamp detection system was designed to be a more feasible ridt with accuracy as high as rt-pcr methods for detecting most recent human influenza viruses and avian influenza viruses infecting humans although a variety of reliable and affordable rt-lamp methods have been developed to detect human or avian influenza viruses each can only detect an individual subtype 2329 34 35 or limited subtypes of human influenza viruses andor avian influenza viruses infecting humans 18 30 36 37 in a pandemic it is critical to rapidly differentiate patients infected by seasonal flu from those infected by an emerging strain thus reliable and affordable multiplex detection tools should be capable of identifying broad-spectrum influenza viruses infecting humans moreover rt-lamp method for most recent emerging hpai h5n6 and h5n8 viruses which have high potential to infect humans has rarely been developed or evaluated for its detection efficacy in addition to broad-spectrum detection of human influenza viruses using our multiplex rt-lamp assay we optimized commercially available colorimetric rt-lamp enzyme previous studies have also shown that the colorimetric visualization system using dyes eg sybr is detectable by naked eyes 38 however these colorimetric methods require additional steps eg adding dye to test for color changes after reaction or the use of a uv device for visualization 39 that can decrease their utility in resource-limited primary care settings rt-lamp assay is one of promising diagnostics tools that can be utilized to empower disease detection in developing countries as it does not require sophisticated expensive equipment or trained personnel the complex design of each specific primer sets made to amplify target sequence with high degree of sensitivity and specificity is one of major recognized constraints of this assay recognizing its advantages when detecting rna genome of viral pathogens rt-lamp assay still requires improvement particularly for the rna extraction step to be an efficient and suitable field-based diagnostic tool current approaches for rna extraction of nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirate specimens collected from influenza-suspected patients usually require laboratory processing equipment eg use of centrifuge system and others laboratory devices technical support and electricity thus the use of chaotropic salt extraction which does not require centrifugation 40 would improve the feasibility of the developed multiplex rt-lamp method as it utilizes a syringe with rna-binding filter method 41 furthermore it has been reported that the rt-lamp reaction could be performed without rna extraction step for some rna viruses 42 although our multiplex rt-lamp assay has not been optimized to directly detect influenza viral rna without rna sample preparation it would significantly increase its feasibility as a diagnostic tool for poct although rt-lamp assays designed to detect victoria lineage type-b viruses has 10 times less sensitivity compared to one-step rt-pcr and qrt-pcr approaches rt-lamp reactions for other subtypes exhibited similar or higher sensitivity without cross-reaction to various human infectious viruses and other subtypes of avian influenza viruses furthermore our multiplex rt-lamp assay was more sensitive than a conventional rt-pcr approach using clinical or spiked samples although the rt-lamp detection method for h7n9 was optimized and evaluated single spiked sample for clinical verification would be a limitation of the method the specificity of multiplex rt-lamp assay demonstrated in this current study might have limitations for use as a primary detection method based on local epidemiological setting however this assays rapid detection has a valuable contribution by providing diagnostics specifically in areas with prevalent avian influenza viruses infecting humans our multiplex rt-lamp method not only can minimize the use of expensive lab instruments and devices but also can detect broad-spectrum human influenza viruses and avian influenza viruses infecting humans as accurately and more rapidly than conventional rt-pcr-based detection methods suitable for use in on-site testing this method will improve and aid in the diagnosis of influenza infections and potentially increase the speed of clinicians to provide

significantly when compared patients with controls activation of the interferon-mapk pathway is the major defense mechanism but mapk transcription signaling is inhibited in cured patients tcr and bcr vdj recombination is highly diverse in generating different antibodies against sars-cov-2 therefore the interferon-mapk pathway and tcr-and bcr-produced antibodies play important roles in the covid-19

severe and moderate conditions in the cured condition the signal pathway related to mrna translation of the virus was suppressed while the signal pathway related to mapk was significantly enriched fig 2c  table s3-6 to detect whether these signaling pathway changes were specific to covid-19 we compared the covid-19 patients with the patients with influenza a patient 11 acute pharyngitis patient 12 and cerebral infarction patient 13 and found that the signaling pathways were still enriched after filtering with these related disease controls fig s14  among these pathways the interferon-mapk

patients with covid-19 and compared them to those of the controls fig 2g-j fig s7  first we observed up-regulation expression of the interferon signal genes in the covid-19 patients among them interferon -inducible protein 27 ifi27 originally known to involve in innate immunity and to intervene in cell proliferation 22  was increasingly expressed in many cell types including cd1cb dendritic cells table s8  these genes were previously shown to regulate cell invasion migration proliferation and innate immunity by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production 27 28  in three groups of inpatients with different conditions the up-regulated expression of these genes was observed in cd1cb dendritic cell cd1c-cd141dendritic cell cd141clec9a dendritic cell cd8 cytotoxic t cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells interestingly in contrast to the three groups of inpatients the expression pattern of these genes in the two cured patients was the opposite in the cured patients down-regulated expression was detected indicating that the mapk signaling pathway was inhibited in these cells these results indicate that downregulation of the mapk signal pathway may be one sign of patient recovery to further explore the antibody clonal proliferation of tcr and bcr in covid-19 we conducted tcr and bcr vdj single cell transcriptome analysis using integration analysis we detected 83387 tcr cell clones and 12601 bcr clones in the 16 subjects fig 3a  this result revealed the antibody repertoire in patients with all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission perpetuity

tcr clones the more severe the covid-19 condition the distribution of all tcr clones and the number of tcr clones of each patient are shown in fig 3b and table s9  using evolutionary analysis of the

cassevwasdheqyf patient 10 were closely related fig s15  suggesting that these antibody sequences may have a special activity for sars-cov-2 and influenza a compared to tcr the number of bcr clones detected was much lower fig 3c  table s10  however very strong bcr antibodies were not induced in most of the patients except in two moderate patients patients 6 and 8 in one moderate patient patient

covid-19 we detected immune responses to known antigens including epstein-barr virus ebv hiv-1 influenza a yellow fever and other rna viruses as well as dna viruses such as cytomegalovirus cmv in addition autoantigens were detected in the severe condition patient 2 and the moderate condition patients 4 8 and 9 in patient 2 the autoantigen response was obvious activation which indicated that this severe disease condition may be related to strong autoimmunity on the contrary in the critical condition patient 1 only two antibodies against the ebola ebv antigen were detected these results further suggest that the critical condition may be caused by insufficient immunity while the severe condition may be aggravated by excessive autoimmunity in the normal condition no all rights reserved

type i interferon ifn-i is crucial for promoting antiviral defenses through the induction of antiviral effectors 29  in this study our single cell transcriptome results showed that irf27 was up-regulated 81 times more in critical patients 517 times in severe patients 399 times in moderate patients 386 times in mild patients and 295 times in cured patients compared to the normal controls

covid-19 patients consistent with our single cell transcription data the expression profile of fos which is a transcription factor mediating mapk pathway signaling showed up-regulation in covid-19 patients but down-regulation in cured patients this result suggests that fos is a candidate marker gene for cured covid-19 patients we further performed pbmc immunofluorescence testing to compare the protein expressions of ifi27 between patients with covid-19 and controls immunofluorescence staining showed that ifi27 was highly expressed in the whole lymphocyte of patients with covid-19 but only

demonstrated that sars-cov-2 can enter the blood through the circulatory system and cause a blood immune response after infection through the respiratory system therefore in patients with covid-19 the damage is related to multiple organs 32  the leukocyte immune responses involve many cell subtypes including cd8 t cells cd8 cytotoxic t cells cd4 t cells cd4 cytotoxic t cells cd1cb dendritic cells and other cell subtypes after the virus reaches the blood immune cells it might replicate-mainly in axlsiglec6 dendritic cells cd4 t cells and naive cd8 t cells and might activate multiple cell subtypes of the interferon signal pathway to produce effectors such as ifi27 ifitm1 and ifitm3 to fight the sars-cov-2 virus the similar process also happened to influenza and west nile virus infection in human 23 24  through downstream activation of mapk the expression of downstream effectors is activated by key transcription factors such as fos jun and junb which lead to a wide range of antiviral responses in the blood system fig 4c  these results suggested that the immune response may come back the normal situation when the patients recovery and the mapk signal is thus inhibited in conclusion in this study we revealed the immune response process of sars-cov-2 entering the blood circulation system using immune profiling analysis with single-cell resolution in the critical condition the number of different cell types expressed genes and tcrbcr responses indicated a relationship between the critical nature of the patients condition and his immunodeficiency on the contrary the severe condition was shown to be related to a strong autoimmune response and over-activated interferon pathway these results suggested that immune deficiency or immune over-reacts may make patients with covid-19 go to worse condition because of their imbalance adaptive immune response 33 34 35  our study also shows that the activation of the interferon-mapk signaling pathway and tcr-and bcrproduced antibodies play key roles in combating sars-cov-2 infection these results will provide important information for covid-19 treatment and drug development all rights reserved no

outbreak of cryptosporidiosis due to cryptosporidium parvum subtype iida19g1 in neonatal calves on a dairy farm in china na li rui wang min cai wen jiang yaoyu feng lihua xiao   in dairy cattle diarrhea is considered one of the most common syndromes in neonates resulting in high morbidity and mortality during the first 4 weeks of life uetake 2013 neonatal diarrhea is primarily caused by the four most prevalent enteropathogens in calves including rotavirus coronavirus escherichia coli k99 and cryptosporidium spp meganck et al 2014 mono-infections with one pathogen or co-infections with two or more pathogens are commonly seen brar et al 2017 cai et al 2017 among them cryptosporidium spp and rotavirus are most frequently identified in fecal specimens from neonatal calves all over the world cho et al 2013 al mawly et al 2015 mohamed et al 2017 
cryptosporidium spp are important protozoan parasites that infect a wide variety of vertebrates including humans and farm animals feng et al 2018 the association of cryptosporidium infection with bovine diarrhea was first reported in 1978 pohlenz et al 1978 this was followed by direct demonstration of the occurrence of diarrhea in experimentally infected calves tzipori et al 1983 since then cryptosporidiosis has been considered one of the most important causes of diarrhea and enteritis in neonatal calves globally blanchard 2012 cho and yoon 2014 wang et al 2017 recently several cryptosporidiosis outbreaks have been reported in neonatal calves in australia estonia india and china resulting in high mortality and substantial economic losses izzo et al 2011 randhawa et al 2012 cui et al 2014 brar et al 2017 niine et al 2018 four cryptosporidium spp including cryptosporidium parvum cryptosporidium bovis cryptosporidium ryanae and cryptosporidium andersoni are responsible for the majority of cryptosporidium infections in cattle with c parvum dominating in pre-weaned calves c bovis and c ryanae in post-weaned calves and c andersoni in adult cattle in most areas xiao 2010 among them c parvum accounts for over 90 of cryptosporidium infections in neonatal calves and is the only major pathogenic and zoonotic species in dairy cattle thomson et al 2017 the pathogenicity of c bovis and c ryanae in post-weaned calves has not been established thomson et al 2017 within c parvum many subtypes exist based on sequence characterizations of the 60 kda glycoprotein gp60 gene among them calves in most industrialised countries are commonly infected with iia subtypes especially subtype iiaa15g2r1 xiao 2010 in addition iid subtypes have been identified in dairy calves in some countries such as sweden turkey romania and egypt bjorkman et al 2015 vieira et al 2015 ibrahim et al 2016 taylan-ozkan et al 2016 in contrast pre-weaned dairy calves in china are commonly infected with c bovis and when they are infected with c parvum almost exclusively with iid subtypes especially iida15g1 and iida19g1 feng and xiao 2017 in 2016 a diarrhea outbreak was identified in neonatal dairy calves on a large dairy farm in jiangsu province china approximately 60 of neonatal calves on this farm died due to severe watery diarrhea this study aims to explore causes of the diarrhea outbreak as well as the pathogenicity of the three most common cryptosporidium spp in dairy calves fecal specimens from dairy cattle in this study were collected with the permission of the farm manager and the cattle were handled in accordance with the animal ethics procedures and guidelines of the peoples republic of china the research protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the south china agricultural university this study took place on a large dairy farm in jiangsu province in east china there were approximately 5500 dairy cattle including 600 neonatal calves on this farm the majority of animals on the farm were of the holstein breed with fewer than 50 of the jersey breed from january to april in 2016 a diarrhea outbreak in neonatal dairy calves was noticed on the study farm with watery diarrhea occurring in over 400 pre-weaned calves fig 1
a approximately 360 calves died at 1020 days of age despite being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to identify the cause of the outbreak fecal specimens were collected from 18 seriously ill calves during the outbreak in april 2016 table 1
 to further investigate the transmission and pathogenicity of cryptosporidium spp after the outbreak 1372 fecal specimens were collected from pre-weaned 3 months post-weaned 312 months and adult 24 months dairy cattle on the farm in may 2016 n  356 august 2016 n  512 june 2017 n  304 and november 2017 n  200 table 2
 fecal specimens were divided into three groups formed feces from animals with no diarrhea n  1126 loose feces from animals with moderate diarrhea n  149 and liquid feces from animals with watery diarrhea n  97 feces were collected directly from the rectum of each cattle using disposable gloves into 50 ml centrifuge tubes approximately 1 g of each fecal specimen was transferred into a 15 ml tube and kept frozen at 80 c while the remaining feces were stored in 25 potassium dichromate at 4 c to perform a preliminary diagnosis of the cause of the calf diarrhea fecal specimens of 18 seriously ill calves submitted by the farmer were tested by enzymatic immunoassay eia for the four most common enteric pathogens in cattle in this 200 mg of frozen fecal specimen were tested for rotavirus coronavirus escherichia coli k99 and cryptosporidium spp by using the pathasure enteritis eia kit biovet saint-hyacinthe canada in addition rotavirus in 418 fecal specimens collected after the diarrhea outbreak from both pre-weaned n  212 and post-weaned n  206 calves was tested using the prospect rotavirus kit thermo-oxoid basingstoke uk for all 1390 fecal specimens preserved in potassium dichromate including the 18 specimens collected during the outbreak 200 mg of feces were washed three times with distilled water by centrifugation at 2000g for 10 min genomic dna was extracted from the washed specimens by using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca usa and stored at 80 c until being analysed by pcr

2 test was used to compare differences in cryptosporidium or rotavirus infection rates between age groups or animals with or without diarrhea to conduct a risk factor analysis animals meeting the criteria of moderate or watery diarrhea were considered as cases of diarrhea logistic regression was used to assess the association between putative risk factors and the occurrence of diarrhea using data from 886 calves of 06 months in age after the diarrhea outbreak initially the strength of association was assessed using a univariate model at the liberal p  02 variables significant at p  02 were thereafter used to build a multivariate model with p  005 being considered significant in the final model odds ratios or with 95 confidence intervals ci were used to identify risk factors for diarrhea occurrence in calves in the initial eia diagnosis of major enteric pathogens in 18 specimens from seriously ill calves fig 1a we found that 13 were positive for cryptosporidium spp eight for rotavirus and all negative for coronavirus or e coli k99 table 1 these 18 specimens were further analysed for cryptosporidium spp by the ssrrna-based pcr which led to the identification of c parvum in 15 of them including all 13 eia positive specimens fourteen of the c parvum-positive specimens were successfully subtyped as iida19g1 by sequence analysis of the gp60 gene among the 1372 fecal specimens collected from calves after the diarrhea outbreak 418 were tested for rotavirus by eia altogether 38212 179 specimens from pre-weaned calves were positive while 6206 29 specimens from post-weaned calves were positive the infection rate of rotavirus in pre-weaned calves was highest 339 at 1 week of age decreased afterwards in calves of 25 weeks of age and mostly remained zero in calves older than 6 weeks fig 1b in pre-weaned calves the highest infection rate for rotavirus occurred in calves with watery diarrhea 280 followed by those without diarrhea 176 and with moderate diarrhea 100 in post-weaned calves infection with rotavirus was similar among animals with watery diarrhea 26 moderate diarrhea 31 and no diarrhea 29 pairwise 
2 analysis showed that none of the differences between any two of the symptom groups of pre- and post-weaned calves reached significance p  005 table 3
 of the 1372 fecal specimens collected after the diarrhea outbreak 195 142 were positive for cryptosporidium spp by pcr analysis of the ssrrna gene table 2 the highest infection rate was 227 139612 in pre-weaned calves followed by post-weaned calves 84 43514 and adult cattle 10 2195 table 2 pairwise 
2 analysis among the three age groups all showed highly significant differences in infection rates p  0001 in pre-weaned calves the infection rate for cryptosporidium spp in april 2016 833 was significantly higher p  005 than those in may 2016 217 august 2016 533 june 2017 282 and november 2017 176 fig 2
a odds of cryptosporidium infection in calves during the diarrhea outbreak were 44235 times higher than after the outbreak the same trend was also observed in the occurrence of c parvum 833 37 467 225 and 165 of specimens were positive in april 2016 may 2016 august 2016 june 2017 and november 2017 respectively fig 2a the occurrence of c parvum infection during the outbreak was also significantly higher p  005 compared with after the outbreak with or  571296 rflp analysis was successful for all 195 ssrrna pcr-positive specimens allowing the identification of four cryptosporidium spp in dairy cattle overall c parvum was the most frequently identified species n  79 followed by c ryanae n  48 c bovis n  31 and c andersoni n  3 concurrent infections with mixed cryptosporidium spp were detected in 34 cattle and included c ryanaec bovis n  26 and c parvumc bovis n  8 table 2 in dna sequence analysis the representative ssrrna sequences generated from specimens of c parvum n  6 c ryanae n  1 c bovis n  1 and c andersoni n  1 were identical to the genbank reference sequences kp793008 kp793012 kp793007 and km110052 respectively for the c parvum-positive specimens 7787 specimens were successfully subtyped at the gp60 locus and the sequences obtained were all identical to the reference sequence hq009809 of the subtype iida19g1 in genbank in pre-weaned calves infection rates for cryptosporidium spp varied greatly by age in weeks fig 2b the highest infection rate was 510 2651 at 3 weeks of age whereas the lowest infection rate 0 or 034 was at 5 weeks of age during the first 3 weeks 7379 cryptosporidium-positive calves were infected with c parvum fig 2c afterwards c parvum disappeared in pre-weaned calves in contrast c ryanae and c bovis became the only two species identified in calves of 412 weeks of age and co-infection with the two species was commonly seen in these animals in post-weaned calves cryptosporidium infection rates varied from 0 to 354 at 312 months of age fig 3
a the infection rate was highest at 3 months of age decreased to lower than 10 in calves of 46 months of age and remained mostly near zero in calves older than 6 months cryptosporidium ryanae was the most common species identified in the 36 months age groups fig 3b cryptosporidium bovis the second most common species in post-weaned calves was frequently seen in mixed infections with c ryanae or c parvum in contrast to pre-weaned calves c parvum was rarely detected in post-weaned calves being identified in only two calves thus c parvum was much less prevalent in post-weaned calves 04 than in pre-weaned calves 119 
2  59831 p  0000 in addition c andersoni was detected in two calves of 12 months of age and one adult animal in pre-weaned calves cryptosporidium infection rates in calves with moderate diarrhea 347 or watery diarrhea 344 were significantly higher than in calves without diarrhea 184 p  001 table 2 table 3 for c parvum the infection rate in calves with watery diarrhea 262 was higher than in calves with moderate diarrhea 109 or no diarrhea 102 the difference in infection rates for c parvum was highly significant between calves with watery diarrhea and no diarrhea 
2  12911 p  0000 unlike c parvum the c ryanae infection rate in calves with moderate diarrhea 89 was significantly higher than that in calves without diarrhea 31 
2  6937 p  0008 in contrast the presence of c bovis was similar between calves with moderate diarrhea 69 and no diarrhea 33 p  0095 in post-weaned calves the highest cryptosporidium infection rate was observed in calves with moderate diarrhea 196 followed by those with watery diarrhea 172 and no diarrhea 66 table 2 the difference in cryptosporidium infection rates was highly significant between calves with moderate diarrhea and no diarrhea 
2  7972 p  0002 table 3 among cryptosporidium spp only c ryanae had sufficient positive specimens to perform the correlation analysis on occurrence of diarrhea showing that the infection rate in animals with moderate diarrhea 87 was significantly higher than those without diarrhea 23 
2  4042 p  0013 in the univariate analysis of risk factors associated with the occurrence of diarrhea in calves of 06 months of age after the diarrhea outbreak cryptosporidium-positive animals had a significantly higher chance of having diarrhea p  0000 table 4
 especially moderate diarrhea p  0002 among cryptosporidium spp c parvum infection p  0004 was a risk factor for the occurrence of watery diarrhea while c ryanae p  0000 or c bovis p  0001 infection was a risk factor for the occurrence of moderate diarrhea surprisingly we found no evidence showing age as a significant risk factor for the occurrence of diarrhea in pre- and post-weaned calves in this investigation p  0779 further analysis using the multivariate model showed that the association of c ryanae or c bovis infection and the occurrence of moderate diarrhea was just below statistical significance p  0055 and 0062 respectively table 4 we identified cryptosporidiosis as the likely cause for the outbreak of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves described in this study this was largely based on results of the initial eia test which identified the presence of c parvum and rotavirus in the 18 seriously ill calves examined during the outbreak two other common enteropathogens for neonatal calf diarrhea coronavirus and e coli k99 were ruled out as the cause of the diarrhea the role of rotavirus in the occurrence of the diarrhea outbreak appears to be small as only fewer than half of the seriously ill calves had the infection and rotavirus infection was not significantly associated with the occurrence of moderate or watery diarrhea in calves during post-outbreak investigation this was further supported by the peak occurrence of rotavirus infection in calves at 1 week of age which is slightly earlier than the age range 1020 days of ill calves during the outbreak the identification of cryptosporidiosis as the cause of the diarrhea outbreak was substantiated by genotyping of cryptosporidium spp in calves all cryptosporidium-positive ill calves had c parvum instead of c bovis which is the dominant cryptosporidium sp in pre-weaned calves in china but mostly avirulent feng and xiao 2017 in addition the occurrence of c parvum in pre-weaned calves was significantly higher during the outbreak than after the outbreak or  571296 and c parvum infection was associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves in a post-outbreak investigation nevertheless rotavirus could have played a secondary role in the outbreak of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned dairy calves on the farm as suggested by investigations of outbreaks of calf diarrhea in australia and india izzo et al 2011 brar et al 2017 in this study pathological investigations were not conducted on dead calves due to the distant nature of the farm from research facilities we became involved with the investigation when the outbreak was nearing the end and the fecal specimens from the 18 seriously ill calves were received by express mail compared with numerous reports of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in humans only a limited number of outbreaks have been documented in dairy calves reynolds et al 1986 aurich et al 1990 xiao et al 1993 in these earlier studies the detection of cryptosporidium infections was based on microscopy or an eia test although the species involved was unknown it was reasonable to assume that these outbreaks were caused by c parvum which is well known to cause watery diarrhea meganck et al 2014 in one recent study in estonia however the c parvum subtype iiaa18g1r1 was identified as the cause of a cryptosporidiosis outbreak in pre-weaned dairy calves niine et al 2018 similarly in china the only reported bovine cryptosporidiosis outbreak was caused by the c parvum subtype iida15g1 cui et al 2014 that outbreak occurred on a dairy farm in ningxia northwestern china leading to the death of 356 calves unlike the finding in ningxia the bovine cryptosporidiosis outbreak reported in the present study was caused by the c parvum subtype iida19g1 although c parvum is still an emerging cryptosporidium sp in dairy cattle in china iida15g1 and iida19g1 subtypes are dominant c parvum subtypes in pre-weaned dairy calves feng and xiao 2017 wang et al 2017 in this study we also examined the transmission characteristics of cryptosporidium spp on this large dairy farm after the diarrhea outbreak the overall infection rate of cryptosporidium spp was 142 which is similar to the average prevalence rate 140 in dairy cattle in china wang et al 2017 as in most previous studies in china and elsewhere fayer et al 2010 venu et al 2013 wang et al 2017 declining infection rates with increased age was also observed in the present study with the infection rate in pre-weaned calves 227 significantly higher than those in post-weaned calves 84 and adult cattle 10 among the four cryptosporidium spp identified on the farm in the present study c parvum was the most frequently detected species in pre-weaned calves c ryanae and c bovis were dominant in post-weaned calves whereas c andersoni was only identified in three older animals this is largely in agreement with the age-related distribution of cryptosporidium spp in dairy cattle elsewhere in the world xiao 2010 however as in some locations of china cai et al 2017 wang et al 2017 c bovis and c ryanae were also common in pre-weaned dairy cattle in fact c ryanae was not only the most common species identified in post-weaned calves but also more prevalent than c bovis in pre-weaned calves in the present study due to the high infection rates of both c bovis and c ryanae a high rate of co-infections with the two cryptosporidium spp was also observed in this study as expected cryptosporidium infection was significantly associated with the occurrence of calf diarrhea in the post-outbreak investigation cho et al 2013 meganck et al 2014 in pre-weaned calves the cryptosporidium infection rate especially the one for c parvum was significantly higher in animals with watery diarrhea than in those with moderate or no diarrhea in 
2 analysis similar observations were also seen in dairy calves in numerous earlier studies aita et al 2015 cai et al 2017 however there was also an association between c ryanae infection and the occurrence of moderate diarrhea in pre-weaned calves this was also the case with co-infections of c ryanae and c bovis the association between c ryanae infection and the occurrence of moderate diarrhea was also seen in post-weaned calves this is contrary to the findings elsewhere that c ryanae has not yet been associated with any clinical signs in infected calves wang et al 2017 the pathogenicity of c parvum and c ryanae observed in this study was supported by results of the logistic regression analysis cryptosporidium parvum infection was significantly associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in a univariate analysis whereas c ryanae or c bovis infection was associated with the occurrence of moderate diarrhea previously the pathogenic potential of c bovis was suggested in some earlier reports based on its detection in pre-weaned calves with diarrhea silverlas and blanco-penedo 2013 silverlas et al 2013 lee et al 2016 the present study represents to our knowledge the first description of such an association through statistical analysis of epidemiological data in conclusion we report a cryptosporidiosis outbreak caused by c parvum subtype iida19g1 in neonatal calves with significant mortality on a large dairy farm in jiangsu china this serves as new evidence of the virulence of this emerging subtype in the country in addition c ryanae and c bovis have been shown as potential causes for moderate diarrhea in dairy calves the emerging nature of c parvum in farm animals in china the high mortality in this outbreak and a lack of effective treatment for cryptosporidiosis highlight the need to develop control measures against the transmission of c parvum on dairy farms  isolation tissue distribution and molecular characterization of two recombinant canine coronavirus strains v ntafis v mari n decaro m papanastassopoulou n papaioannou r mpatziou c buonavoglia e xylouri   canine coronavirus ccov order nidovirales family coronaviridae is a large enveloped single stranded rna virus responsible for enteritis in dogs decaro and buonavoglia 2008 recently due to changes in virus classification the virus was classified as a member of the genus alphacoronavirus species alphacoronavirus-1 together with transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine tgev and feline coronavirus fcov carstens 2010 the genome 27 kb in length contains two large overlapping open reading frames orfs orf1a and orf1b which encompass the 5 two thirds of the genomic rna and encode polyproteins leading to the replicase complex the orfs encoding for the structural spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins and the non-structural proteins 3a 3b 3c 7a and 7b are located downstream of the replicase gene decaro and buonavoglia 2008 coronaviruses are characterized by constant genetic evolution and diversity to date two different ccov types have been recognized ccov type i ccov-i and ccov type ii ccov-ii that share significant genetic similarity with fcov type i fcov-i and fcov type ii fcov-ii respectively decaro and buonavoglia 2008 moreover in 2009 tgev-like ccovs of potential recombinant origin were identified and characterized as a new ccov subtype ccov-iib decaro et al 2009 decaro et al 2010 erles and brownlie 2009 ccov is the causative agent of gastroenteritis in dogs characterized by high morbidity and low mortality clinical signs include anorexia lethargy vomiting mild to severe diarrhoea usually lasting 12 weeks and occasionally death mainly in puppies the disease is more severe in young animals carmichael and binn 1981 systemic infections are not usual however during the past few years there have been reports of fatal disease with ccov strains detected in the enteric tract as well as in the organs buonavoglia et al 2006 decaro et al 2009 in 2010 ccov identification molecular characterization and sequence analysis took place for the first time in greece regarding common enteric ccov-ii strains detected in a severe outbreak of diarrhoea in a kennel ntafis et al 2010 in the current study we report the quantitation and molecular characterization of two tgev-like ccov strains detected in the organs of two puppies displaying fatal enteritis during summer of 2009 two dead dogs were submitted for laboratory investigation the dogs were coming from two different pet shops of thessaloniki a city of northern greece both dogs a 6-week-old yorkshire terrier 6609 and a 16-week-old pomeranian 6809 presented fever lethargy inappetence severe haemorrhagic diarrhoea and vomiting leading to death 2 days after the onset of the symptoms the first puppy was vaccinated with a single dose of a polyvalent vaccine against all major infectious diseases canine distemper infectious hepatitis parvoviral enteritis parainfluenza and leptospirosis 2 weeks before the symptoms while the second one had never been vaccinated necropsy examination of both dogs revealed linear haemorrhages of the intestinal wall haemorrhagic enteritis and ulcerated duodenum sero-sanguineous fluid was observed in the abdominal cavity of the pomeranian lungs of both puppies were congested with multiple areas of emphysema no lesions were observed at the heart liver of both puppies appeared enlarged friable and yellow-brown in color with multifocal discolorated spots congested vessels in the dura mater of the brain were also observed samples from the faeces and the parenchymatous organs were subjected to virological investigations using methods previously described regarding common canine viral pathogens eg canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 pcr and real time pcr decaro et al 2005a decaro et al 2006a decaro et al 2006b canine distemper virus cdv rt-pcr frisk et al 1999 canine adenovirus type 1 and type 2 cav-1 and cav-2 pcr hu et al 2001 and ccov rt-pcr pratelli et al 1999 for virus isolation a-72 cell line canine fibrosarcoma was used the cells were grown in dulbecco-minimum essential medium d-mem supplemented with 10 foetal bovine serum fbs faecal and tissue samples were homogenized 10 wv in d-mem and centrifuged at 8000  
g for 10 min supernatants were treated with antibiotics 1000 iuml penicillin and 100 gml streptomycin for 30 min inoculated on partially confluent a72 cell cultures and then they were incubated at 37 c in a 5 co2 incubator after an adsorption period of 30 min d-mem was added cells were daily observed for cytopathic effect cpe of ccov for 5 days an immunofluorescence if assay was used for the detection of ccov at the infected cells for the if assay a 1100 dilution of cat polyclonal serum specific for alphacoronavirus-1 and a 1100 dilution of goat anti-cat igg conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate sigmaaldrich usa each sample was considered negative after 3 passages rna was extracted from faecal and organ samples of both dogs using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit and the rneasy mini kit qiagen gmbh hilden germany respectively for ccov type i and ii detection and quantitation in faecal and organ samples two real time rt-pcr assays with the same sensitivity were used decaro et al 2005b reverse transcription was performed using geneamp rna pcr applied biosystems italy according to the manufacturers instructions for the discrimination of classical subtype iia and tgev-like subtype iib ccovs two rt-pcr assays with comparable levels of sensitivity were performed as previously described decaro et al 2010 rt-pcrs with primers 20179ins-r ccov-iia or 20179174-268 ccov-iib were conducted using superscript one-step rt-pcr for long templates invitrogen srl in order to verify the absence of tgev strains in the samples that were positive by ccov-iib specific assay an rt-pcr able to discriminate ccov and tgev according to the amplicon size was used wesley 1999 the 3 end of the genome of the ccov-iib strains was amplified as previously described using viral rna extracted from the lungs superscript one-step rt-pcr for long templates invitrogen srl and six pairs of primers specific for overlapping fragments encompassing orfs 2 3a 3b 3c 4 5 6 7a and 7b decaro et al 2007 the nucleotide sequences were determined in both directions by a commercial facility beckman coulter genomics united kingdom sequence assembling and analysis were carried out using the bioedit software package hall 1999 and the national center for biotechnology information ncbi httpwwwncbinlmnihgov and european molecular biology laboratory embl httpwwwebiacuk analysis tools phylogenetic analysis was conducted using mega4 program tamura et al 2007 phylogenetic trees based on the amino acid sequences of s e m and n proteins were elaborated using neighbor-joining method supplying a statistical support with bootstrapping over 1000 replicates simplot was used for nucleotide sequence comparison of the two strains to alphacoronavirus-1 reference strains lole et al 1999 the sequences of strains 6609 and 6809 were registered in genbank under the accession numbers hq450376 and hq450377 respectively by means of nested pcr assay for ccov viral rna was detected in faeces lungs spleen kidneys pancreas heart and liver of both puppies in addition the brain of the pomeranian 6809 was tested positive while the brain of the yorkshire terrier 6609 was tested negative by genotype specific real time rt-pcr assays only ccov-ii was detected in all positive samples ccov-ii rna copiesl of template in the samples are shown in table 1
 in the faecal samples of the two puppies both ccov-ii subtypes were detected while in the organs which tested positive only ccov which was characterized as tgev-like ccov-iib was detected no tgev strains were detected in the samples the ccov-iib strains 6609 and 6809 were isolated from the lung homogenates of both puppies a-72 cells developed a cytopathic effect that consisted of cell rounding and lysis of the monolayer in addition cells were tested positive by the immunofluorescence assay viral titres on cell cultures were 10425 6609 and 104 tcid5050 l 6809 at the 3rd passage both puppies were tested positive for cpv-2a field strains and negative for cdv cav-1 and cav-2 a total of 8822 and 8828 nucleotides were determined for strains 6609 and 6809 respectively encompassing orfs 2 s protein 3a 3b 3c 4 e protein 5 m protein 6 n protein 7a and 7b alignment of the sequences with tgev ccov and fcov reference strains available in genbank showed the highest identity to ccov-iib reference strain 11908 eu924791 982 and 989 for 6609 and 6809 respectively the two greek strains shared an identity of 98 the spike protein gene of both strains was 4374 nucleotides long encoding a protein of 1457 amino acids when compared to four tgev-like reference strains 43007 11908 17406 and 34105 no insertions or deletions were observed the two strains shared 976 aa identity to each other while they showed the highest aa identity to ccov-iib reference strain 11908 983 by simplot analysis the two strains displayed higher nucleotide conservation with the tgev strain purdue than with the pantropic ccov-iia strain cb05 at the 5-end of the s gene fig 1
 phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two greek strains were more closely related to the four ccov-iib reference strains detected in dogs organs fig 2a the envelope protein was found to be 82 amino acids in length like in most canine coronavirus strains and in three tgev-like reference strains 11908 17406 and 34105 with the exception of 43007 which is 7 amino acids shorter the greek strains had high amino acid identity to each other 987 e protein of strains 6609 and 6809 had the highest amino acid identity 100 and 987 respectively to the ccov-iib strains 34105 11908 and to ccov-iia cb05 in the e protein phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two strains were closely related to ccov type ii strains fig 2b the membrane protein m protein of strains 6609 and 6809 was found to be 260 and 262 amino acids long respectively two amino acids were missing from the n-terminal end of the m protein of strain 6609 in positions 24 and 36 as it has been also observed in reference ccov-iib strains 17406 and 34105 the two strains shared high amino acid similarity 946 m protein of strains 6609 and 6809 had the highest amino acid identity to the ccov-iib reference strains detected in the organs 973 and 100 respectively phylogenetic analysis of the m protein showed that the two strains were closely related to ccov-iia and ccov-iib strains fig 2c the n gene nucleoprotein was found to be 1149 nucleotides in length coding for a polypeptide of 382 amino acids the two proteins were 981 similar the amino acid sequences had the highest identity with ccov-iib 11908 986 and 994 for 6609 and 6809 respectively phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two greek strains were more closely related to ccov-ii reference strains fig 2d homologous rna recombination consists one of the major powers of genetic evolution and diversity regarding coronaviruses woo et al 2009 under field conditions mixed infections are required to give rise to recombination events so far experimental infections of piglets woods and wesley 1992 and dogs larson et al 1979 with ccov and tgev strains respectively and the fact that feline aminopeptidase n serves as a functional receptor for both ccov and tgev tresnan et al 1996 strongly suggest that the two viruses can be found growing at the same environment in nature although the exact host of recombination still remains unknown a canine coronavirus strain ucd-1 of potential recombinant origin with tgev was identified for the first time in the late 90s wesley 1999 recently tgev-like strains were reported circulating in dogs in different countries of europe decaro et al 2010 the strains were detected in faecal samples of dogs with gastroenteritis they were classified as the new subtype ccov-iib and it was suggested that they were a result of recombination events occurring at different times of these regarding the old strain ucd-1 decaro et al 2010 in the present study sequence and phylogenetic analysis takes place for the first time in ccov-iib strains detected in greece moreover our findings suggest that tgev-like ccov strains spreading to the internal organs are circulating in dogs since so far there has been only one report in italy decaro et al 2009 by means of real time rt-pcr tissue distribution and quantitation of both strains were assessed for the first time revealing the spreading of the virus to the internal organs the cpv-2 coinfection may contribute to the spreading of tgev-like ccov strains since so far they have been only detected in organs of dogs infected also with cpv-2 decaro et al 2009 however the detection of ccov-iia strains strictly in the faeces in both cases suggests that ccov-iib may have an advantage in disseminating through the dog in the first report of tgev-like strains detected in the organs ccov-i was also detected strictly in the intestinal content in two cases decaro et al 2009 these cases strongly suggest a difference in pathobiology of ccov-iib with respect to ccov-iiia by sequence and phylogenetic analysis it was shown that both strains segregate constantly with the ccov-iib reference strains detected in the organs of dogs accordingly the strains were highly similar to tgev in the 5 end of the s gene whereas they clustered with the pantropic ccov variant cb05 subtype ccov-iia in the e m and n proteins in a previous study ccov-iib strains detected in the organs were found to share higher amino acid identity with cb05 than with ccov common enteric strains at the level of the same proteins decaro et al 2009 whether the ability of ccov-iib strains to spread to the organs is related to the recently recognized recombinant protein s or to the cb05-like proteins e m and n needs further research however the s-protein scenario seems to be more possible since in coronaviruses s protein mediates receptor attachment and tissue tropism shift has been associated with mutations in the s gene masters 2006 in the last decade new genotypes and subtypes of canine coronavirus have been recognized furthermore a pantropic variant with the ability to cause fatal systemic infection was detected buonavoglia et al 2006 previous studies revealed that there are antigenic differences between ccov-i and ii pratelli et al 2004 in addition antigenic differences were observed between the two subtypes ccov-iia and ccov-iib tgev-like ccovs decaro et al 2009 whether the currently circulating vaccines can protect against the tgev-like recombinant isolates or not has to be verified via vaccinations and experimental infections in conclusion this was the first report of ccov-iib tissue distribution up to now there has been only one report of tgev-like strains detected in internal organs of puppies in italy based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the structural proteins the two greek isolates were found to be related to the italian prototype ccov-iib strains in addition in all cases a mixed infection with cpv-2 was reported however the detection of ccov-iia strains strictly at the faeces suggests that ccov-iib strains may have an advantage in disseminating throughout a dog with cpv-2 coinfection in contrast to common enteric ccov-iia strains  respiratory syncytial virus subtype on1na1ba9 predominates in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections ruyan fan chuping fan jian zhang bo wen yefei lei chan liu lijuan chen wenpei liu chuan wang xiaowang qu   respiratory syncytial virus rsv is a common pathogen that induces acute lower respiratory tract infections lrtis in the elderly and in children especially infants nair et al 2010 a metaanalysis estimated that rsv accounts for 34 million hospitalizations and 66000199000 deaths due to acute lrtis among children less than 5 years old worldwide anderson 2013 due to

2014 ren et al 2015 have been described the newly identified on1 subtype of rsva which was first reported in canada in 2010 eshaghi et al 2012 contains a unique 72nucleotide duplication in the second hypervariable region of the g gene and may be spreading rapidly perhaps replacing na1 another prevalent rsva subtype in countries such as china south korea germany and italy kim et al 2014 pierangeli et al 2014 tabatabai et al 2014 cui et al 2015 a similar duplication phenomenon in the variable region of the g protein was also observed in the ba subtype of rsvb in 1999 in buenos aries argentina trento et al 2003 this strain spread rapidly to additional countries resulting in the current prevalence of rsvb infections dapat et al 2010 trento et al 2010 the molecular epidemiological characteristics of rsv have been described previously for southwestern zhang et al 2010b qin et al 2013 northwestern zhang et al 2010a cui et al 2015 and eastern china liu et al 2014 however there is limited information regarding the molecular epidemiology of rsv in south china south china has a humid climate and a high frequency of acute respiratory infections in young children in the present study we screened hospitalized children under 5 years old with lrtis or upper respiratory tract infections urtis in chenzhou china and analyzed the molecular epidemiological characteristics of the rsv strains identified the study was performed in the department of pediatric the first peoples hospital of chenzhou university of south china in 2014 and the study protocol was approved by the hospital

enzymelinked immunosorbent assays to detect human coronavirus and mycoplasma pneumonia and pcr to detect human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus sputum and blood cultures for bacterial detection were also performed all sputum samples were obtained on all children once before treatment by aspiration unless the patient was suffering from severe progressive disease or ineffective treatment and blood for bacterial culture was obtained from patients who had a fever all positive pcr products were sequenced by the genscript nanjing company the sequences were determined and analyzed using the basic local alignment search tool blast program available on the ncbi homepage httpblastncbinlmnihgovblastcgi a maximum likelihood tree was constructed in mega51 software the deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed with mega51 and bioedit software potential nglycosylation asnxaaserthr sites were predicted using the netnglyc 10 server httpwwwcbsdtudkservicesnetnglyc alignments of the second hypervariable region of the g protein were compared to those available from genbank ifa revealed that 64 of the 238 hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections who were screened 27 had rsv infections of those 64 patients 48 75 were male 16 25 were female most 6364 984 were diagnosed with lrtis at the time of admission cough n  64 100 sputum production n  61 953 wheezing n  49 765 and fever n  30 469 were the most common symptoms observed table i previous allergies including eczema urticarial dermatitis and asthma were reported in 25 39 patients sequencing of the rsv g gene in the patient samples indicated that 2464 375 and 4064 625 patients had rsv genotypes a and b respectively demonstrating simultaneous circulation of rsva and b in the study area furthermore in the 24 rsvainfected patients subtypes on1 n  13 54 and na1 n  11 46 were predominant and 39 of the 40 rsvbinfected patients were infected with rsv subtype ba9 thus subtypes on1 na1 and ba9 are the dominant circulating subtypes that cause respiratory infections in children in this geographical area on1 is a newly identified rsva subtype eshaghi et al 2012 and our data indicate that on1 infections exhibit some differences in the age of onset compared to na1 na1 mostly infected children less than 6 months old 818 whereas on1 did not show this trend in total coinfecting viruses were detected in 9 157 of the 64 rsvinfected patient samples with human coronavirus being the most common table ii bacteria were isolated from 14 219 of the patient samples with escherichia coli accounting for six of those 14 mycoplasma was detected in 3 45 of the patient samples bacteria were mainly isolated from sputum n  9 including e coli n  4 klebsiella pneumoni n  2 straphylococcus aureus streptococcus pneumonia and serratia marcescens each n  1 in the remaining five cases bacteria were detected in blood cultures table ii sequences of the g gene from 24 rsva and 40 rsvb isolates were successfully obtained and aligned with representative genbank sequences of previously published genotypes the rsva strains were clustered into two subtypes on1 with a 72 nucleotide g gene duplication and na1 fig 1a the rsvb strains were clustered into two subtypes ba9 with a duplication of 60 nucleotides and gb2 fig 1b to evaluate the circulating of rsv in china we analyzed the predominant genotype of human rsv in children from northeastern beijing eastern suzhou and shanghai southwestern chongqing and northwestern lanzhou china in the most recent 8 years table iii these regions have experienced infections with similar subtypes of rsv abbaaba in the last 8 years zhang et al 2010a2013 2010b cui et al 2015 2013 qin et al 2013 liu et al 2014 ren et al 2014 however we lacked the complete datasets from lanzhou and chenzhou additionally the na1 and ga2 subtypes have been the predominant rsva subtypes present and the ba9 subtype has been the predominant rsvb subtype present there are distinct subtypes of rsva present in beijing na1 shanghai na1 and chongqing ga2 and lanzhou ga2 from 2007 to 2011 the predominant rsv genotype in the present study sample was rsvb whereas that identified in a study in beijing in the same time period was rsva table iii we aligned and compared 19 hunan rsv genotype a on1 and na1 and 21 genotype b with the prototype strain a2 genbank accession number m11486 fig 2 and ch10b gb1 strain genbank accession number af065250 fig 3 respectively the deduced amino acid sequences of subgroup na1 and on1 observed in this study had two predicted lengths 297 and 321 aa due to the duplication of amino acids 261283 ie qeetlhsttsegylspsqvytts and the predicted lengths were 298 and 320 for the ch10b and ba9 subtypes due to the duplication of amino acids 241260 ie erdtstpqstvldtttskht and the loss of amino acids 167168 ie pk data are not shown respectively compared to the a2 prototype on1 subtypespecific substitutions s222p e232g t253k and p292l were observed in all of the on1 subtypes there were six unique amino acid substitutions for na1 n251y p310l p313s s314p p316s and p317s in the a2 prototype strain there are three potential nglycosylation sites nxt where x is not a proline in the second variable region of the g protein however all of the on1 isolates and most of the na1 isolates had lost the nglycosylation site at amino acid 251and 249 due to t251k and n249y substitutions respectively fig 2 compared to the gb1 all ba9 strains had t207p a215d p219l t223p t229i l237p e238k s247p l257s v270a and l287y substitutions fig 3 sequences of gprotein genes were submitted to genbank accession numbers kt781344kt781406 rsv is the most common pathogen that causes lrtis in infants and young children eshaghi et al 2012 but few studies of the molecular epidemiology of rsv have been conducted in china especial south china in this study we analyzed the genetic diversity and patterns of cocirculating genotypes of both rsva and rsvb subtypes in chenzhou south china in 2014 of the 64 rsv positive cases 24 were rsva and 40 were rsvb respectively phylogenetic analyses confirmed that the majority of the rsvb strains clustered with ba9 and that the rsva strains clustered with strains of the new genotype on1 and its ancestor na1 in line with other studies in china and elsewhere this study reports ba ba9 as the predominant genotype zhang et al 2010b rebuffoscheer et al 2011 yamaguchi et al 2011 ren et al 2015 suggesting that this subgroup has undergone adaptation and rapid spreading interestingly the predominant subtype in chenzhou from 2013 to 2014 was different from that in beijing which may be due to the differing climates between the two regions the novel on1 genotype which has a 72nucleotide duplication in the cterminal third of the gprotein gene was first detected during the winter of 20102011 in ontario canada eshaghi et al 2012 a similar duplication phenomenon in the variable region of the gprotein was also observed in the 1999ba genotype of rsvb trento et al 2010 over the last 15 years the ba subtype became the globally dominant rsvb strain dapat et al 2010 trento et al 2010 zhang et al 2010b rebuffoscheer et al 2011 yamaguchi et al 2011 ren et al 2015 now on1 has thus far been detected in many countries including canada eshaghi et al 2012 italy pierangeli et al 2014 germany tabatabai et al 2014 china cui et al 2013 liu et al 2014 ren et al 2014 japan hirano et al 2014 malaysia khor et al 2013 india choudhary et al 2013 south korea lee et al 2012 thailand auksornkitti et al 2014 kenya agoti et al 2014 and south africa valleyomar et al 2013 these studies suggest that the on1 subtype was transmitted globally and rapidly supporting this notion many countries have reported that on1 has become the predominant subtype lee et al 2012 agoti et al 2014 pierangeli et al 2014 tabatabai et al 2014 thus whether the on1 subtype will follow the pattern of the ba subtype and become the predominant strain of rsva worldwide is a question of great interest in china the on1 strain was first reported in beijing bj35320 in 2012 zhang et al 2010a later circulation of the on1 genotype was reported in chongqing ren et al 2014 and shanghai liu et al 2014 according to the circulating pattern of the rsv subtypes in chongqing the na1 genotype has been the predominant rsva strain for the past 8 years and the on1 genotype will be the predominant rsva subtype in 20142015 table iii ren et al 2014 our results which are in line with this circulation pattern indicate that the on1 genotype was the predominant rsva subtype in 2014 suggesting that a rapid spread of this emerging rsv strain had occurred thus the on1 genotype may become the predominant strain of rsv in china but further study will be needed to confirm this possibility phylogenetic and deduced amino acid sequence analyses of the cterminal hypervariable region of the g protein among rsv strains revealed that ongoing changes characterized the different clusters within the rsva subtype similar to previous studies conducted in china the on1 genotype was characterized by e232g t253k and p292l substitutions ren et al 2014 additionally an s222p substitution was also observed in all on1 genotypes interestingly all of the on1 strains and almost all of the na1 strains had lost the nglycosylation site at amino acid 251 due to t251k and n249y substitutions respectively auksornkitti et al 2014 however it is not clear how these changes favored evasion of the host immune response in accordance with a prior study hall et al 2009 most of the rsvinfected children in this study were diagnosed with bronchiolitis or pneumonia after presenting with the symptoms of cough persistent wheezing fever and sputum production presentation of clinical symptoms did not differ between patients with rsva versus rsvb infections our agegroup analysis revealed that infants under 1 year of age accounted for 756 of the detected rsv infections and infants less than 6 months old accounted for 53 interestingly the age distribution of patients with subtype on1 infections was more uniform across age groups whereas the na1 and ba9 subtypes were found mostly in infants less than 6 months old thus we hypothesized that the on1 genotype is a novel rsv genotype and given that most children were infected with on1 for the first time we reasoned that the organism must have no specific protective immunity conversely na1 and ba9 mainly infected infants less than 6 months of age likely because infection provides protective immunity thereafter although limited thus the vast majority of rsv reinfections are with genetically distinct strains agoti et al 2012 unfortunately the sample size of this study was not large enough to confirm this reasoning in summary the molecular characterization of rsv in this geographical area in 2014 indicated that genotypes ba9 na1 and on1 cocirculated and that the predominant genotype was ba9 in line with other studies in china and elsewhere it can be hypothesized that subgroup on1 will become the predominant strain of rsva worldwide similar to the emergence of the ba genotype these findings will improve the understanding of the molecular characterization of rsv in south china however further surveillance of circulating rsv genotypes genetic diversity and the corresponding clinical data is needed to better understand the antigenic mechanisms of rsv infections  euclidean distance analysis enables nucleotide skew analysis in viral genomes formijn van hemert maarten jebbink andries van der ark frits scholer ben berkhout   nucleotide skew analysis 1 provides a powerful tool to visualize compositional aspects of a dnarna sequence for instance the minimum and maximum of a g vs c skew can be used to predict the origin of replication and the location of the terminus respectively in prokaryotic genomes 24 the genskew algorithm 1 calculates ratio values of the six nucleotide combinations c vs g g vs a u vs g u vs a c vs a and u vs c in predefined windows and steps along a sequence ratio values are calculated according to n1-n2n1n2 and hence a positive value indicates that n1 wins over n2 skew graphs are generally created by plotting the subsequent windows as numbers on the x-axis against the corresponding cumulative skew values on the y-axis in this way we demonstrated for a representative collection of rna viruses that the skew plots can be interpreted as nucleotide compositional signatures of the viral genomes and that these characteristic signatures are more prominently observed in the single-stranded regions than that in the base-paired double-stranded regions of a viral rna genome 5 likewise we demonstrated that purine enrichment in the zika virus rna genome 6 is a general property of most but not all flaviviridae and surprisingly prominently observed at the first position of the codons and not the silent 3rd codon position unpublished results it is however difficult time-consuming and nonquantitative to compare different skew graphs with respect to similarities and dissimilarities we therefore developed a simple mathematical addition to genskew analysis that converts skew data into a pairwise euclidean distance matrix which can be formatted by means of clustering into a neighbour-joining tree facilitating the identification of putative relationships eg between viral sequences the key result of this study is that this euclidean algorithm offers an easy and quantitative interpretation of nucleotide skew data of virus genomes the construction of euclidean distance trees based on skewed nucleotide compositions does not require a prior alignment of the sequences in contrast classical phylogenetic trees are modelled after accurate nucleotide alignment of the sequences as an additional result we demonstrate that skew distance trees and phylogenetic trees are surprisingly similar but not identical nucleotide sequences of the single-stranded ss rna genomes of coronavirus picornavirus and hiv reference strains and unclassified species were downloaded from the viralzone database httpviralzoneexpasyorg 7 8 flaviviridae were selected and classified according to 9 10 berkhout and van hemert unpublished results genbank ids are provided in the figures nucleotide skew analysis was done by means of the genskew algorithm 1 of which dr t rattei technische universitt mnchen kindly provided a version that is not restricted by the length of a sequence for normalization purposes the overlapping window size was set 1 of the sequence length with a step size of 20 of the window size the skew between two nucleotides n1 and n2 is defined by the ratio n1  n2n1  n2 and hence a positive value of this ratio indicates that n1 proportionally exceeds n2 if the n1 versus n2 comparison results in a negative skew value the same but positive skew value is true for these nucleotides in the reverse order n2 versus n1 algorithms converting skew data into a pairwise euclidean distance matrix are provided as additional file s1 the multiple sequence alignment of coronaviral flaviviral picornaviral and hiv genomes was obtained by means of mafft 11 other alignments and neighbor joining nj skew distance trees were built in mega v7 12 phylogenetic histories were inferred by using the maximum-likelihood method based on the general time reversible model of nucleotide substitution in the viral genomes 12 a discrete gamma distribution 5 categories was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites the tree with the highest log likelihood is shown randomization of the rubella virus rna genome 10 consecutive cycles to ensure complete nucleotide randomization was performed by means of the bioweb server httpwwwcellbiolcomscriptsrandomizerdnaproteinsequencerandomizerphp all calculations were performed in excel we used the rubella virus with its g- and c-rich rna genome jn635295 to illustrate the skew plot analysis figure 1 skew profiles are shown of the nucleotide sequence before figure 1a and after 10 consecutive cycles of randomization figure 1b the profiles are nearly identical because skew profiles are determined solely by nucleotide composition and not by the nucleotide sequence the rubella virus rna genome size is 9761 nucleotides and hence the window size and step size are set to 98 1 of sequence length and 20 20 of window size respectively generating 489 overlapping windows from the 5- to the 3-end x-axis with the corresponding skew values cumulatively plotted on the y-axis the skew lines start by definition at the origin of the plot it should be noted that in skew language cg does not represent a cg base pair but a comparison of the c with the g nucleotide proportions we adopted the notation c versus g c vs g in the text and the figures the nucleotides c and g win over a steep positive slope and the u-nucleotide loses from c and g steep negative slope by approximately the same proportion c is slightly more prominent than g and the proportions of u and a are close to equality importantly the skew profiles are straight lines which indicates that the virus-specific nucleotide bias is quite constant along the sequence of the rna genome therefore skew values at the ultimate 3 end of the genome position 489 represent a reliable measure of the pairwise nucleotide compositional bias of the rubella virus genome for instance the skew endpoint values of c vs a 21624 and u vs c 21337 are very similar but with the opposite sign the same is true for g vs a 16979 and u vs g 16802 and the skew endpoint values for c vs g and u vs a are 5639 and 231 respectively for the rubella virus genome these values can be considered a characteristic signature of the nucleotide composition and presented as a vector in a six-dimensional euclidean space c vs g g vs a u vs g u vs a c vs a u vs c  5639 16979 16802 231 21624 21337 the skew lines n1  n2n1  n2 are shown of the rubella virus genome sequence figure 1a and the same sequence after 10 consecutive cycles of nucleotide randomization figure 1b overlapping windows are plotted on the x-axis against the corresponding skew values cumulatively on the y-axis the algorithm outlined above can be applied to sets of sequences provided that one carefully preserves the order of nucleotide comparisons as well as the normalization of window and step sizes to gain 500 cumulative skew values the resulting vectors can be formatted into a pairwise euclidean distance matrix and visualized by means of cluster analysis as a neighbor-joining tree it should be emphasized that the branch nodes of the skew value trees predict equality of the nucleotide skew values among the viral species involved in contrast branch nodes of evolutionary trees derived by means of nucleotide substitution models mark the expectation of sequence equalitythe common ancestorof the taxa involved hence only partial similarity between the two tree building methods can be expected here we apply the procedure to collections of arbitrarily chosen genomes of picornaviruses flaviviruses coronaviruses and hiv-1 subtypes first we investigated whether the euclidean skew algorithm is able to discern differences among the four families of viral genomes next the four viral families are individually subjected to the euclidean skew analysis indeed the neighbor-joining tree figure 2a shows a consistent clustering of the hiv-1 subtypes red the coronaviruses black and the flaviviral species blue the picornaviruses green are significantly less resolved notably hiv-1 genomes share a enrichment as the common feature of their nucleotide composition 13 coronavirus genomes typically tend to accumulate the u-nucleotide 14 and the flaviviridae displays enhanced purine proportions in the first codon positions unpublished results the genomes of picornavirus species do not display such a prominent compositional feature apparently the skew algorithm is able to discern viral families by giving credit to unique compositional features that are typical of a virus family viral genomes with a nucleotide composition that is more relaxed like picornavirus rna are resolved poorly by the skew algorithm a classically constructed phylogeny of the viruses shows a similar grouping figure 2b hiv red coronavirus black and flavivirus species blue are clustered in separated clades whereas representatives of picornavirus are found scattered among the flavi- and coronaviruses with respect to salivirus aichivirus foot-and-mouth disease virus and hepatitis a virus both trees show similar topological positions but in general this is not the case in addition construction of classical phylogenetic trees relies a great deal on the accurate alignment of the sequences involved which becomes less reliable as the evolutionary distance of the taxa increases for that reason we separately analyzed the four virus families virus genomes are mentioned by short names and genbank ids and are colored black coronaviruses blue flaviviruses green picornaviruses and red hivs the trees were constructed by means of neighbor-joining clustering nj figure 2a and by maximum likelihood phylogeny ml figure 2b the scale bars are in skew units figure 2a or estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site figure 2b coronavirus rna genomes show high u and low c proportions that are quite variable and in fact act like communicating vessels 14 indeed a bipartition can be observed in the cluster tree based on euclidean skew distances figure 3a the upper group containing the mers and sars in red isolates is characterized by relatively low u vs c skew values varying from 120 to 31 the lower group with the human 229e nl63 and oc43 coronaviruses displays u vs c skew values increasing from 140 to 201 apparently the opposite movement of the u and c proportions in coronaviral genomes is a distinctive feature and hence an important parameter in shaping coronaviral phylogenies is based on nucleotide substitution figure 3b we included two unclassified virus isolatesmarked in italicto investigate whether the method can contribute to an initial virus classification the unclassified bat-rousettus isolate is found near the vespertilio coronavirus and the unclassified bat-bm48-31 isolate is at the root position of in the upper clade coronavirus genomes are mentioned by short names and genbank ids clustering of mers and sars coronaviruses is indicated by coloring in red numbers in brackets indicate u versus c skew values two clades differing by u vs c skew values can be discerned in the skew-based tree the upper clade with u vs c proportions decreasing from 120 to 31 and the lower clade with u vs c proportions decreasing from 201 to 140 the two unclassified isolates are italicized the trees were constructed by means of neighbor-joining clustering nj figure 3a and by maximum likelihood phylogeny ml figure 3b the scale bars are in skew units figure 3a or estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site figure 3b the flaviviridae represent an extensive group of ssrna viruses with a diverse nucleotide composition yet the pairwise distance tree based on skew values figure 4a is in remarkable agreement with the topology obtained by means of evolutionary models figure 4b 9 dengue virus denv bovine viral diarrhea virus bvdv yellow fever virus yfv zika virus zikav west nile virus wnv species and the unclassified bamaga flavivirus are clustered into the clade of mosquito-borne flaviviruses the unclassified anopheles menghai and xishuangbanna flaviviruses map in between the mosquito-borne viruses and the tick-borne representative louping ill virus liv the insect-specific culex flavivirus cxfv and cell fusing agent virus cfav cluster together finally the skew algorithm distinguishes the hepaciviruses from the pegiviruses including wenling shark virus wlsv consistent with more classical phylogeny 10 flavivirus genomes are mentioned by short names and genbank ids representatives of the flaviviruses are colored red dengue virus and pestivirus green flavivirus blue tick-borne flavivirus light-blue insect-specific flavivirus yellow hepacivirus and magenta pegivirus the five unclassified flavivirus genomes are italicized the trees were constructed by means of neighbor-joining clustering nj figure 4a and by maximum likelihood phylogeny ml figure 4b the scale bars are in skew units figure 4a or estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site figure 4b the skew cluster tree of picornaviruses figure 5a also matches the tree topology based on nucleotide substitution figure 5b as an exception the rhinoviruses of humans and equines are close neighbors based on skew values that are separated more distantly in the standard evolutionary tree two of the three unclassified picornaviruses washington bat and bat crohivirus map in the cluster of avian emv and hepatitis a virus the unclassified african bat icavirus takes a position in between rosavirus 2 and two rhinoviruses picornavirus genomes are mentioned by short names and genbank ids the three unclassified picornavirus genomes are italicized the trees were constructed by means of neighbor-joining clustering nj figure 5a and by maximum likelihood phylogeny ml figure 5b the scale bars are in skew units figure 5a or estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site figure 5b the reference sequences of hiv-1 subtypes show much less compositional divergence than corona- flavi- and picornaviruses as indicated by the approximately 10x smaller size of the scale bar figure 6 in fact the nucleotide skew profiles are nearly identical to the average skew value with small standard deviation table 1 the well-known a-accumulation in hiv-1 genomes 13 is prominently demonstrated by the negative values for g vs a u vs a and c vs a table 1 avg 10130 11886 and 17162 respectively a-accumulation occurred mainly at the expense of c c vs g 7715 u vs c 5948 similar calculations for average skew values and standard deviations of coronavirus flavivirus and picornavirus genomes did not provide useful avg and stdev data table 1 hiv-1 subtype genomes are mentioned by subtype and genbank ids the trees were constructed by means of neighbor-joining clustering nj figure 6a and by maximum likelihood phylogeny ml figure 6b the scale bars are in skew units figure 6a or estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site figure 6b differences can be observed between the euclidean skew tree of hiv-1 subtypes and the hiv-1 topology based on regular nucleotide substitution models figure 6 for instance the evolutionary tree indicates a close relationship of f1 and f2 strains and between both hiv-1-crf isolates which is not observed in the skew-based tree the dominant a-pressure in hiv may drive the compositional signatures of different hiv sequences towards similar skew values by which the resolving power of the euclidean skew algorithm becomes insufficient for a proper discrimination among hiv-1 subtypes in addition different sequences may have similar skew profiles for example randomization of a sequence does not alter the skew profile of the nucleotides figure 1 finally unclassified hiv-1 subtypes were not found in the viralzone database pairwise euclidean distance analysis facilitates an easy initial interpretation of the relationships among viral sequences based on skew values as a nucleotide compositional signature the algorithm distinguishes related and unrelated sequences particularly in case of compositional features that are characteristic for a certain virus family eg a-accumulation in hiv the u-c balance in coronavirus genomes and the purine enrichment at the first codon position in flaviviral genomes within a family of viral genomes the topology based on euclidean skew distances is surprisingly similar but not identical to the topology based on regular evolutionary analysis coronavirus flavivirus and picornavirus this is remarkable because branch nodes in skew-based trees predict equal skew values of both sequences and in contrast branch nodes in evolutionary trees mark nucleotide sequence equality of the two taxa the resolving power of skew value analysis is diminished at high sequence similarity as shown for hiv-1 subtypes this is due to the prominent a-pressure in all hiv genomes 15 the key focus of this research was the euclidean analysis of nucleotide skew data among virus genomes in addition we demonstrated similarity of skew data-based cluster trees with classical maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees constructed via a general time reversible gtr model of nucleotide substitution during evolution confidence of ancestral nodes in classical trees is usually attained by means of bootstrap analysis which requires repetitive resampling of sites in the original sequence alignment each bootstrap replicate generates a tree and a consensus tree is constructed based on the collection of replicates each node in this consensus tree is decorated with the frequency number  that reflects the level of bootstrap support it is evident that a skew-based pairwise distance matrix cannot be used for bootstrap analysis simply due to the absence of a sequence alignment also resampling of sites in a sequence prior to skew analysis does not affect the skew data vector figure 1 future investigation may reveal whether the building of skew-based trees may serve as a valuable addition to many sequence-independent methods of evolutionary tree reconstruction euclidean skew analysis supports the study of nucleotide compositional features and facilitates the classification of unclassified viral sequences as nearest neighbors of classified ones compared with methods based on nucleotide substitution models euclidean skew analysis is very robust in that it tolerates sequence errors and shifts in reading frames  chronic infections can shape epidemic exposure pathogen co-occurrence networks in the serengeti lions nicholas fountain-jones m craig packer maude jacquot f blanchet guillaume karen terio meggan craft e  pathogens are embedded in a complex network of microparasites that can collectively or individually alter disease dynamics and outcomes chronic pathogens for example can either facilitate or compete with subsequent pathogens thereby exacerbating morbidity and mortality pathogen interactions are ubiquitous in nature but poorly understood particularly in wild populations we report here on ten years of serological and molecular data in african lions leveraging comprehensive demographic and behavioral data to utilize pathogen networks to test if chronic infections shape infection by acute pathogens we combine network and community ecology approaches to assess broad network structure and characterize associations between pathogens across spatial and temporal scales we found significant non-random structure in the lion-pathogen co-occurrence network and identified potential facilitative and competitive interactions between acute and chronic pathogens our results provide a novel insight for untangling the complex associations underlying pathogen co-occurrence networks  identifying and determining the nature of species interactions of multiple pathogens within hosts is increasingly considered critical to understanding infectious disease dynamics eg pedersen  fenton 2007 johnson et al 2015 seabloom et al 2015 fountain-jones et al 2018  individuals are often co-infected by a diverse infra-community of pathogens and interactions between pathogens can both alter infection dynamics cattadori et al 2008 susi et al 2015 and influence disease outcomes moss et al 2008 munson et al 2008 wejse et al 2015  pathogens that form chronic long-lasting infections are ubiquitous and are likely to overlap pathogens that produce short-lasting acute infections fenton 2008 randall et al 2013 rynkiewicz et al 2015 aivelo  norberg 2018  chronic pathogens can compete for the same resources as acute pathogens and can reduce the likelihood of infection randall et al 2013 budischak et al 2018 or conversely facilitate infection via immune suppression eg geldmacher  koup 2012  interactions between chronic pathogens such as between helminths and bacteria are relatively well understood eg ezenwa 2016  yet interactions between chronic and acute pathogens particularly between microparasite species are largely unknown as humans for example are on average exposed to ten chronic and acute virus species alone xu et al 2015  untangling the ecological interactions between microparasites represents a clear knowledge gap that has significant consequences for understanding pathogen dynamics munson et al 2008  discriminating between positive or negative interactions between pathogens in populations is complicated by the short time window that an acute pathogen is shedding and thus detectable with molecular methods and by potentially confounding host environments tompkins et al 2011  this is particularly the case for microparasites where pathogen detection often relies on serology and thus without resampling the same individual the precise timing of exposure cannot be estimated detection of chronic pathogens may be more straightforward as the infection is active for more extended periods but deducing pathogen interactions is difficult without extensive longitudinal data tompkins et al 2011 fenton et al 2014  identifying whether two pathogens interact due to host-habitat preferences the increasing likelihood of exposure with age or infra-community processes such as competition is methodologically challenging poulin 2007 johnson  buller 2011 fenton et al 2014 clark et al 2016  further competition between pathogens could result in increased mortality associated with a particular combination of pathogens su et al 2005  detecting interactions between pathogens is also likely to depend on taxonomic and spatial scales that are seldom considered stutz et al 2018  studies commonly aggregate pathogen data to genus level but interactions between pathogens can be subtype or genotype-specific eg wejse et al 2015 benesh  kalbe 2016 brook et al 2017  for example individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus subtype 1 hiv-1 are four times more likely to become coinfected with tuberculosis compared to individuals with hiv-2 wejse et al 2015  beyond subtype or genus genotype-specific associations have been demonstrated in snails infected by trematodes louhi et al 2015 and in rodents infected by bartonella bacteria brook et al 2017  infra-community dynamics are also likely to vary with spatiotemporal scale for example pathogen associations in amphibian communities differed substantially at the host scale compared to the pond scale but these effects can be reversed or undetected at other scales stutz et al 2018  in general interactions between free-living species are more apparent at scales although pathogen co-occurrence networks are valuable for quantifying broad structural patterns they do not account for environmental or host factors or differences in spatial or temporal scale joint species distribution models fill this gap by simultaneously assessing environmental influences and interspecific co-occurrences across multiple scales using hierarchical bayesian mixed models warton et al 2015 ovaskainen et al 2017  here we use both co-occurrence network and joint species distribution models to examine the structure of pathogen-pathogen networks and quantify pathogen associations whilst controlling for environmental and host factors we collate ten years of data on acute and chronic pathogens in 105 african lions panthera leo as well as extensive host and environmental data from the serengeti lion project slp packer et al 2005  the slp datasets provides a unique opportunity to understand pathogen co-occurrence networks in a wild population whilst controlling for group individual and environmental characteristics we use this data to ask the following interlinked questions to what degree is the co-occurrence network of pathogens in serengeti lions nested or segregated ii after accounting for environmental and host factors is the type of chronic infection an individual is infected by associated with subsequent exposure to an acute pathogen are there important chronic-chronic or acute-acute pathogen cooccurrence patterns we view co-occurrence at two levels of taxonomic resolution and across spatiotemporal scales we describe a step-analytical pathway that can assess broad network structure and quantify pathogen interactions across multiple scales that can generally be applied to infectious disease dynamics detecting pathogen co-occurrence patterns not only provides novel insights into pathogen infra-community dynamics but also helps aide surveillance efforts and generates testable hypotheses that can be answered in laboratory experiments pathogen data serological testing and quantitative pcr qpcr was performed to detect acute and chronic pathogens from blood samples taken from lions in the serengeti national park tanzania from 1984-1994 in total 394 individuals were sampled throughout this period but our analysis was restricted to the 105 individuals tested for the full suite of pathogens see table 1 for pathogen natural history and table s1 for the number of individuals tested per year included in the analyses nomadic individuals ie lions that were not resident in any pride were excluded due to the difficulty of assigning environmental variables see confounding variables below serological data for canine distemper virus cdv feline calicivirus parvovirus and coronavirus has been published previously packer et al 1999 but see table s2 for assay details with the exception of rift valley fever rvf to detect rvf exposure we conducted a plaque reduction virus neutralizing test prnt that quantified virus neutralizing antibodies from serum as per the scott et al 1986 protocol anthrax bacilus anthracis and feline herpes virus were excluded from analysis because all lions were seropositive packer et al 1999 lembo et al 2011  similarly feline leukemia virus felv was also excluded because al lions were seronegative hofmann-lehmann et al 1996  we used qpcr for identification of nucleotides for feline immunodeficiency virus fiv ple  and the protozoan pathogens in this study table 1  three distinct subtypes of fiv ple co-circulate in lions in the serengeti troyer et al 2005 troyer et al  2011 antunes et al 2008  and thus subtype specific qpcr was performed see troyer et al 2004 troyer et al  2005 for qpcr protocols the resultant 300 base pair sequences from the pol gene were aligned and assigned to 21 operational taxonomic unitsgenotypes based on a 95 molecular similarity threshold see fountain-jones et al 2017 for details lions also commonly get chronically infected by a rich protozoan fauna including babesia and hepatazoon genera we developed quantitative pcr protocols using density gel gradient electrophoresis to identify each protozoan species see munson et al 2008  we categorized each pathogen as chronic or acute based on the literature and as the biology of most of these pathogens in lions are poorly understood age-prevalence relationships pathogens which peak in prevalence at a young age  2 yo with little temporal fluctuation were considered to be chronic whereas an increasing age-prevalence relationship and high temporal variation were classified as more acute fig s1  feline coronavirus can have both acute and chronic forms and it is impossible to assess which form the individual was exposed to from serological data but based on age-prevalence relationships we categorized it as a chronic infection fig s1  as most individual lions were likely to be infected by chronic infections within the first two years after birth troyer et al 2011 fig  s1 we assume that acute exposure typically occurred whilst the individual was infected by the chronic pathogen we then partitioned the chronic pathogen data into two sets based on taxonomic resolution high and medium the high taxonomic resolution dataset encompassed fiv ple genotype and babesia species data whereas the medium resolution dataset aggregated fiv ple subtype information and babesia data to genus level summary co-occurrence network 1 0 we created a summary co-occurrence matrix nn griffiths et al 2014  that described the amount of co-occurrence of both chronic and acute pathogens within individuals by multiplying the incidence matrix ie contingency table that described the occurrence of pathogens across individuals by its transpose we then computed a measure   of network structure and modularity index based on node overlap and segregation strona  veech 2015  is scaled from -1 to 1 where -1 represents an entirely segregated network and 1 represents an entirely nested network the co-occurrence matrix was also used to evaluate preferential associations among pathogens utilizing a modularity-based greedy approach clauset et al 2004  measures of modularity aim to determine the adequacy of different classification schemes in representing clusters and divisions in datasets here the clusters represented the co-occurrence of pathogens in individual hosts estimates of modularity were calculated for each possible classification by comparing the expected fraction of co-occurrence of pathogens compared to the quantity if the co-occurrences happened randomly newman 2006  the classification with the highest modularity from all the generated classifications was selected this analysis was performed using the igraph library in r csrdi  nepusz 2006  the co-occurrence matrix was obtained from the incidence matrix using the graphincidence and the bipartiteprojection functions the classification analysis was performed using the fastgreedycommunity function and graphical output were produced using the tkplot function in igraph joint species distribution modeling 1 1 1 we fitted joint species distribution models jdsm for both high and medium taxonomic resolution datasets combining information on environmental and host covariates see confounding variables below for details to the occurrence data for each of the pathogens pathogens detected fewer than five times were excluded from this analysis we fitted all the jsdms with bayesian inference using hierarchical modelling of species communities hmsc blanchet et al 2018  for each analysis we modeled the response pathogen coexposure matrix using a probit model in each model we added individual pride-year ie which pride and year the individual was sampled in and year sampled as random effects we utilized the default priors of the framework described in full detail in ovaskainen et al 2017 and ran the hmsc model twice using 3 million mcmc samples the first 300 000 of which being burnin each run was carried out using a different seed visual inspection of mcmc traces were performed to assess convergence in addition we made sure that the effective sample size ess of each parameter was  200 as part of the slp most of the individuals in this study have been regularly observed since birth  we selected 13 predictor variables that we thought were likely to be important for pathogen exposure and thus could confound possible interaction patterns table 2  we included variables that captured individual variability eg age at sampling and pride characteristics including environmental variables eg average vegetation cover of the prides territory see table 2 for measurement details we attempted to calibrate each predictor set based on possible epidemic year eg calculating rainfall for the year the individual was co-infected by the acute pathogen as determined by packer et al 1999  1 2 however this removed a large number of males from the dataset as their natal pride were unknown and this reduced the power of our analyses not including anthrax and herpes to which all individuals had been exposed the serengeti lions were exposed to an average of 5 pathogens two acute and three chronic sd  1 with one individual had been infected by 9 of 10 pathogens based on medium resolution data fig s3  remarkably cubs between 1 and 2 yo had been already infected with an average of 4 pathogens sd  1 with one 15 yo cub positive for 5 all lions were qpcr positive for at least one protozoan species and 25 of them were infected by all four considered the high taxonomic resolution summary network indicated a significantly nested architecture   074 with relatively low modularity modularity index  0393 z  3307 p  0001 with three clusters fig 1a  the largest cluster green nodes included all of the protozoans acute pathogens and some fiv ple genotypes whilst the remaining two clusters consisted just of fiv ple genotypes fig 1a  while the high prevalence fiv ple genotypes clustered in the largest cluster the b2 b3 and c2 genotypes clustered separately  and the disconnected c7 was only detected in one pride during the 1980s the light red cluster is likely to result from the restricted distribution and temporal period in which these genotypes were identified eg the north western region of the slp in the 1990s the blue and green clusters in contrast included a variety of prides over the full sampling period with the exception of b2 and b6 which were only detected in the woodlands in the 1980s phylogenetically similar genotypes of fiv did not cluster 1 3 together fig s4  in contrast the medium resolution network was completely nested with no modularity   1 modularity index  0 z    p  0 and no significant clusters fig 1b  after accounting for environmental individual and pride factors the jsdm analysis identified strong associations between pathogens fig 2  that were not detected in the summary cooccurrence network the nature of these interactions however was dependent on the scale assessed at an individual and pride-year scale we found strong associations between a small subset of acute and chronic pathogens fiv ple b and h felis were negatively associated with rvf fig 2  and fiv ple b was also negatively associated with parvovirus  fig 2as5a  however this interaction could only be detected at medium taxonomic resolution in contrast at high taxonomic resolution we identified positive interactions between b gibsoni and rvf that were not detected at medium-resolution the strongest associations between chronic and acute pathogens were detected at the lowest spatial-temporal resolution landscape-year in the high taxonomic resolution model pathogens separated into two groups with each group having a very similar association profile fiv ple c1 had a higher prevalence fig s6  c1 had the same overall association profile as fiv ple c associations between acute pathogens were rare at the year-level we detected positive associations between cdv and parvovirus with both pathogens negatively associated with calicivirus  fig 2cs5c  in contrast associations between the chronic pathogens were common but the nature of the interaction also differed at each taxonomic scale for example in the medium resolution model we detected a positive association between h felis and fiv ple c that was not found in the high-resolution model indicating that fiv ple subtype but not genotype was important for this association fig 2bs5b  strikingly we found that fiv ple subtypes had contrasting association profiles at the individual level fiv ple b and c were negatively associated with each other and negatively and fiv ple c was positively associated with coronavirus whilst fiv ple b was negatively associated with coronavirus  fig 2as5a  see fig 3 for a summary of all of the associations detected across scales and figs s78 for model details here we demonstrate non-random pathogen interactions infecting wild african lions with both facilitative and competitive associations detected between chronic and acute pathogens across different spatiotemporal scales we found that whilst there was minimal structure in the summary co-occurrence network fig 1a  we uncovered structure after accounting for scale and controlling for potentially confounding environmental and host variables fig 2  the particular chronic pathogen an individual is infected by as a cub may have consequences for which acute pathogen the individual is infected with later in life fig 3  moreover we detected strong relationships between chronic pathogens across scales and these associations may have 1 5 consequences for lion health we emphasize that the approach used here can start to untangle pathogen infra-community relationships and identify potential chronic-acute interactions in wild populations these can then be compared with knowledge of pathogen pathogenesis and validated in-vitro in a laboratory setting whilst clinical or laboratory studies of co-infection in lions are rare the associations we found have clear precedence in similar pathogens co-infecting humans our results not only provide new insights on disease dynamics in the serengeti lions but also provide a valuable framework for exploring pathogen co-occurrence networks and infracommunity dynamics across taxonomic and spatial scales co-occurrence networks were highly nested with relatively low modularity particularly at a medium taxonomic resolution this contrasts with the more modular human parasite cooccurrence network griffiths et al 2014  however this is not surprising as the human networks included host resources and immune system components as nodes and we lacked data the predicted stability or otherwise of our lion co-occurrence network is uncertain theoretically if such a strongly nested network were mostly mutualistic ie pathogens facilitate other pathogens if the prevalence of one pathogen decreased significantly due to 1 6 vaccination for example the overall structure would not alter eg thebault  fontaine 2010 however this may not hold for networks consisting of both positive and negative associations as found here sauve et al 2014  conversely the relatively low segregation in the lion network could mean that a perturbation would be less likely to be restricted to a particular compartment griffiths et al 2014  we recommend further empirical and theoretical investigations on the consequences of nested or segregated networks on the stability of pathogen infra-communities after accounting for environment and host effects we found that the chronic pathogens were strongly associated with the acute pathogens across scales for example at an individual scale chronic infections negatively interacted with rvf coinfections between bunyaviruses like rvf and retroviruses are likely common in humans and wildlife though there are surprisingly few studies addressing the topic in contrast relationships between dengue virus a flavivirus and hiv are relatively well understood flaviviruses and hiv share similar immune receptors that can inhibit hiv replication and the molecular machinery used to do so maybe a viable way to control hiv infection eg xiang et al 2009  given the overall structural similarity of flaviviruses and bunyaviruses hernandez et al 2014  it is possible that a similar mechanism underlies the association in lions between rvf and fiv ple that we observed although we show that this association was subtype specific if this was true rvf may actually inhibit fiv ple b infection counter to our assumption that chronic pathogens in our system infected each individual first fig 3  relationships between acute and chronic pathogens were strongest at the year-landscape level leading to mortality of nearly 40 of the lion population in 1994 munson et al 2008  we found that all tick-borne hemoparasites showed potentially facilitative associations with cdv including b leo with insert despite its low prevalence in 19934 fig s9  parvovirus was also positively associated with cdv but this was likely due to similarities in epidemic cycles with a parvovirus epidemic in 1992 just before the 1994 cdv epidemic packer et al 1999  parvoviruses are also immune suppressive and so the timing of the parvovirus outbreak may also have contributed to the cdvbabesia-induced mortality the general negative relationship between fiv ple c and cdvbabesia supports the theory that individuals infected by subtype c were more likely to die in the consequent babesiacdv outbreak troyer et al 2011  thus this negative association may not be due to competition between pathogens but rather to mortality our approach detected strong interactions between the chronic pathogens for example there were opposing associations between the fiv ple subtypes and coronavirus fig 2  negative associations between retroviruses and coronaviruses are rarely reported yet there are plausible molecular pathways hiv-1 and human coronaviruses hcov share remarkably similar binding receptors chan et al 2006  and some mild hcov strains even considered a viable vaccine against hiv eriksson et al 2006  this may explain the negative association we detected for fiv ple b and coronavirus but does not explain the positive association between fiv ple c and coronavirus we detected across scales the mechanism driving fiv ple subtype specific relationships with coronaviruses are unclear and as coronaviruses infecting lions are also likely 1 8 to be genetically diverse examining the genetic structure of coronavirus may help untangle these associations further in contrast competitive interactions between hiv strains are well characterized with hiv-1 for example found to outcompete hiv-2 for blood resources arin et al 2005  for fiv ple  even though co-infection is relatively common troyer et al 2011 competition between subtypes could be important as there is anecdotal cell culture evidence that fiv ple b can propagate more rapidly than fiv ple c melody roelke unpublished data there were also contrasting associations between the protozoan species for example the distribution of b felis was not shaped by any other protozoan and in general had a narrow association profile fig2  unlike the other babesia species for the individuals co-infected by protozoans combinations involving b felis were also common whereas co-infections involving h felis and the other babesia species varied in prevalence and composition fig s9  even though b gibsoni and b felis show similar age prevalence profiles fig s1  the prevalence of b felis over time was relatively stable compared to the other protozoa fig s10  differences in the host range for individual babesia species and potential host differences in virulence may partially explain these patterns for example b felis has only ever been detected in felids whereas b gibsoni has a much broader host range including canids penzhorn 2006  more generalist pathogens may have greater pathogenicity as there can be reduced selective restraint on virulence particularly in dead end hosts woolhouse et al 2001  if more pathogenic species are more likely to form significant associations with other pathogens compared to less virulent pathogens is an open question in disease ecology importantly patterns like these would be missed without incorporating high-resolution pathogen data there are however limitations to this approach the inability to distinguish mortality from competitive interactions is one of them and careful interpretation of negative associations is necessary incorporating approaches such as structural equation models that explicitly include potential mechanisms that underly candidate pathogen interactions carver et al 2015 could be a valuable additional step in future pathogen network studies another weakness is the inability to estimate the timing of these infections more precisely for example the negative association between rvf and h felis could be due to differences in rainfall affecting vector abundance with higher rainfall years increase mosquito abundance thus increasing rvf prevalence fig s2  in contrast low rainfall years increase the risk of lions being exposed to ticks munson et al 2008 thus potentially increasing h felis prevalence as rainfall was calibrated to the age of sampling rather than the age of infection which could differ the jsdm approach could not capture this variation furthermore we cannot quantify the importance of these associations in shaping pathogen distribution across scales compared to processes such as host density also the number of samples we had did differ across years table s1  with most coming between 1985 and 1994 and this have influenced some patterns particularly between genotypes lastly incorporating immune function and host resources in both the summary network and jsdm analyses are likely to provide mechanistic insight into pathogen network structure griffiths et al 2014  however given the daunting complexity of pathogen infra-community dynamics our two-step approach can assess broad network structure and identify useful candidate interactions between pathogens thereby reducing some of this complexity the high frequency of co-occurrence and co-infection in lions -and the potential for specific associations to cause population decline -highlights the importance of understanding pathogen 0 2 0 associations the summary lion co-occurrence network is highly connected with both positive and negative associations between chronic and acute pathogens and altering the network could assist with disease control for example individuals vaccinated for both parvovirus and h felis could potentially be at lower risk of babesia and cdv infection conversely our networks show that there could be unintended consequences of controlling a pathogen as has been shown for deworming fenton 2013  for example it is possible that vaccination targeting coronavirus in this population could increase b gibsoni infections that may in turn lead to a higher risk of cdv exposure whilst these relationships are correlative rather than mechanistic it is clear from our study that relationships between microparasites are common and should be considered in disease management our findings indicate that the lions pathogen infra-community is complex but interactions between pathogens are important we identify useful candidate interactions between pathogens thereby reducing some of this complexity more broadly our work demonstrates how different network approaches can be combined to gain insights into the ecological factors underlying pathogen structures and interactions and how this can be applied to the study of pathogen communities of wildlife populations in addition to these biological insights the study highlights several critical areas for methodological improvement that can currently limit robust inference of pathogen interactions from time-series serological and qpcr data addressing these limitations is timely given the ongoing threat of wildlife populations decline creating an urgent need to integrate better molecular ecological and network

alizon s et al 2015  co-infection alters population dynamics of infectious disease nat commun 6 5975 thebault  we calculated this predictor two years prior to sampling to account for differences in individual status at a potential time of exposure or infection eg individuals that had just immigrated into a pride when sampled were considered nomads as exposure or infection was likely to have occurred previously  we averaged over two years to reduce the variability in pride counts as exposure was unlikely to have happened during the sampling year 3 2 fig 1  pathogen summary co-occurrence

elimination of sar-cov-2 through vaccination as inspired by elimination of multiple influenza viruses through natural pandemics or mass vaccination ji-ming chen ying-xue sun ji-wang chen  the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the novel virus sars-cov-2 has claimed many lives worldwide to combat the pandemic multiple types of vaccines are under development with unprecedented rapidity theoretically the future vaccination against covid-19 may fall into long-term costly guerrilla warfare between sars-cov-2 and humans elimination of sars-cov-2 through vaccination to avoid the potential long-term costly guerrilla warfare if  even if a safe and effective vaccine shall be marketed in months vaccination against covid-19 may fall into long-term guerrilla warfare between sars-cov-2 and humans first after the pandemic covid-19 could be as mild as human diseases caused by other human coronaviruses or as severe as the coronavirus diseases in swine chicken feline and murine which are all more burdensome than influenza 3 second sars-cov-2 could escape vaccination through its rapid mutation including site substitutions genomic recombination and open reading frame shift 4 third sars-cov-2 could move swiftly through the movement of infected people and hide in some people for weeks without symptoms 5 fourth the hidden sars-cov-2 could attack unpredictably susceptible humans who have not been infected or vaccinated or have no sustainable immunity induced by the infection or vaccination or have innate or acquired immunodeficiency vaccination could accelerate the mutation of viruses through natural selection and sars-cov-2 could diverge into distinct lineages through its rapid mutation both of which could escalate the guerrilla warfare between sars-cov-2 and humans accordingly the vaccine should be updated promptly to match the mutated virus and multiple vaccine strains or antigens should be used to match major diversified lineages of the virus the vaccination update of the vaccine and addition of vaccine strains or antigens could be all highly burdensome difficulty in vaccine development rapid mutation of coronaviruses long-term guerrilla warfare between viruses and humans and heavy disease burden have been demonstrated in animal coronavirus diseases 3 the above information suggests that elimination of sars-cov-2 through vaccination to avoid the potential long-term costly guerrilla warfare if possible is highly desired and worth extensive discussion and intensive consideration moreover this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved the elimination initiative is inspired by the interesting history that multiple influenza viruses have been eliminated through natural pandemics or mass vaccination as explained below during the past seven decades three human influenza viruses huivs disappeared coincidently with emergence of three influenza pandemics 7 first the h1n1 subtype huiv which circulated in humans for many years before 1957 disappeared during the pandemic of h2n2 subtype huivs emerging in 1957 second the above h2n2 subtype huiv which circulated for approximately ten years after 1957 disappeared during the pandemic of h3n2 subtype huiv emerging in 1968 third the h1n1 subtype huiv which circulated after its re-emergence in 1977 disappeared during the pandemic of swine-origin h1n1 subtype huiv emerging in disappearance of the above three huivs can be explained only by the broad and strong herd immunity induced by the relevant pandemic viruses in statistics and in biology 7 this means that the pandemics provided natural rapid global and highly effective vaccination which eliminated the three huivs having circulated in humans for years the pandemic viruses harbored multiple genes from the eliminated viruses or shared the same ha and na subtypes with the eliminated viruses table 1  8 they thus shared various t andor b cell epitopes with the eliminated viruses and so the immunity induced by the pandemic viruses exerted the elimination effect the above elimination events demonstrated that the pandemic viruses although disastrous induced broader and stronger herd immunity than commercial influenza vaccines which could reduce infections caused by limited clades of huivs within the same ha subtype the pandemic of swine-origin h1n1 huiv in 2009 did not eliminate the h3n2 subtype huiv which has circulated since 1968 possibly because these two viruses did not harbor any genomic segments table 1  although the pb1 gene of the pandemic virus was from h3n2 subtype huivs circulating approximately ten years before 2009 8 and they thus shared less t andor b cell epitopes in 1977 the h1n1 huiv this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved which circulated in the 1950s re-emerged worldwide possibly due to a laboratory incident and most infected people were under 23 who had not encountered the h1n1 huiv before 1977 9 therefore re-emergence of the h1n1 huiv induced lower herd immunity than the above pandemics and thus did not eliminate the above h3n2 huiv either deliberate vaccination has also eliminated an aiv 10  the mechanism of elimination of the three huivs and two aivs is that strong immunity was induced in almost all susceptible hosts in affected areas against the targeted virus through natural or deliberate vaccination in a relatively short time 14 and the established herd immunity blocked the circulation of a targeted virus completely these events indicate that elimination of covid-19 which is also a respiratory infectious disease caused by an rna virus is possible and should be based on rapid establishment of global herd immunity through mass vaccination theoretically the coming two years is the golden time for elimination of sars-cov-2 through vaccination because sars-cov-2 shall likely have not diversified into distinct lineages during this period and thus one vaccine strain or antigen could match all lineages of sars-cov-2 circulating worldwide 6 moreover many people shall have been infected in the coming months by sars-cov-2 which aids to establish strong herd immunity for the elimination elimination of covid-19 through vaccination should be a great project requiring tremendous national and international collaboration figure 1  and the elimination project is of the vital interests of all countries as it saves much money and many lives for all countries moreover most people in the world have known the risk of covid-19 and could actively aid or involve the elimination china government has pledged to donate two billion usd to the world to fight covid-19 and such donations could support strongly this elimination project we assessed preliminarily that the benefitcost ratio of the elimination could be over ten because the elimination this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved through vaccination required about three-fold efforts for common vaccination in a year and the elimination could remove over 30 years of heavy burden caused by  even if the disease has not been eliminated through tremendous efforts the elimination efforts should remain highly valuable because it could be beneficial for better control of the disease the relevant international cooperation mechanism should be established for the global elimination project all countries should collaborate with unprecedented solidarity to fully discuss this issue rationally design the route map and actively deploy resources to implement the project lessons and experiences of the past in vaccination against other viral infectious diseases should be well considered in the project design the vaccine for the elimination project should be carefully selected the vaccine should be safe effective inexpensive rapid in production easy for storage and convenient for vaccination but few vaccines meet all these requirements 2 table 2 shows presumed advantages and disadvantages of major types of vaccines with exceptions eg some live attenuated vaccines including those for poliomyelitis and mumps are safe for use 15 critically sometimes higher vaccine efficacy means lower safety risk due to lower morbidity for example vaccine b should be superior to vaccine a if vaccine a is of 100 safety and reduces symptomatic covid-19 cases by 60 from 50 to 20 of the vaccinated population and vaccine b reduces symptomatic cases caused by natural infection by 100 although 02 of the people inoculated with vaccine b become symptomatic covid-19 cases caused by the vaccine moreover almost all the few vaccine-associated cases can be cured like that 9984 of the cases in china beyond the province hubei who were treated timely successfully recovered 16 therefore unlike the vaccines for rabies and polio efficacy of covid-19 vaccines could be prioritized codon-modification could reduce the pathogenesis rapidly but whether the lav can be generated and propagate efficiently in cells is of concern because it employs many rare codons 2 considering that lavs are of multiple potential advantages and various successful applications more types of lavs should be developed for covid-19 the elimination history of the three huivs suggests that lpv can induce broad and strong immunity because the relevant pandemic influenza viruses could be considered as lpvs which eliminated the relevant huivs the lpv strategy has been applied successfully in the usa military recruits for nearly 40 years to control acute respiratory diseases caused by types 4 and 7 adenoviruses and reduced the morbidity by over 99 18 it avoids causing disease through oral administration of enteric-coated capsules containing the lpv to bypass the pathogenic site of the fragile lungs 19 beyond inducing broad and strong immunity lpvs are of no concern about pathogenic reversion and inhibit indirectly the mutation and diversification of the targeted virus through replacing various virus mutants circulating in vaccinated regions 20 although the safety of the lpv strategy is a big public concern the safety has been well guaranteed in the lpv of adenovirus used in the usa military recruits and can be further guaranteed with novel measures 20 detailed plans should be formulated to guide the global elimination project over half people worldwide should be vaccinated in a relatively short time to establish the strong herd immunity considering the rate of the vaccine production and risk factors of covid-19 elderly people and healthcare workers should be vaccinated first 21 the this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved mass vaccination is favorably conducted in warm or hot seasons when the prevalence of many infectious viruses including covid-19 is lower and human immunity is higher than in cold seasons 22 moreover epidemiological monitoring system should be well designed and established to identify potential problems associated with the global elimination project and scientific solutions to these problems should be prepared in advance if successful this global elimination project could pave the road for elimination of some other viral infectious diseases it shall also greatly enhance global solidarity which is the core fortune of mankind   development of a multiplex rt-qpcr for the detection of different clades of avian influenza in poultry tran le bac hye kim

avian influenza ai viruses are classified into two pathotypeslow pathogenic avian influenza lpai and hpaibased on the pathogenicity in chickens and molecular determinants of the multibasic cleavage site motif in the hemagglutinin ha protein 34 during the circulation of hpai virus subtypes h5nx and h7nx in poultry they proved to be highly pathogenic with mortality of up to 100 sporadically the h5n1 hpai viruses cross the species barrier into humans according to the who report 5 different subtypes of h5 hpai viruses pose a substantial threat to global health with high mortality rate and huge economic burden to poultry farms outbreaks of h5nx hpai viruses in poultry are increasing and numerous clades of h5nx hpai have been classified since the first detection of the gooseguangdong gsgd h5n1 hpai virus in china 6 however the gsgd viruses and other iavs have reassorted and diversified into 10 separate clades with more than 30 classified higher-order clades identified so far 7 in particular among the reassortment of novel h5nx hpai viruses 2321 and 2344 clades of h5 hpai viruses have become endemic in poultry populations in asian countries such as china vietnam and south korea 89 the novel h5nx viruses have reassorted with different na subtypes such as h5n2 h5n5 h5n6 and h5n8 in poultry and migratory birds 10 the interaction between poultry and migratory wild birds and the complex overlapping flyways contribute to their long distance virus transmission 11 the clade 2321 of h5n1 hpai virus was first identified in hong kong in 2004 since then other subclades including 2321a 2321b and 2321c have evolved 12 in addition there was an outbreak of the h5 clade 2344 virus around the east asian-australasian and american flyways in recent years 131415 furthermore these lineage viruses with different antigenic properties have been cocirculating thus rapid and highly accurate methods are necessary for the detection of h5 hpai viruses and clade identification molecular diagnostic methods are used as the first step in the identification and control of the iav outbreaks thus a number of molecular methods such as dna microarrays 16 loop-mediated isothermal amplification tests 17 and restriction fragment mass analysis 18 have been developed and applied for rapid ha subtyping of the iav field isolates 19 among these methods rt-qpcr has been implemented in most reference diagnostics laboratories for the detection and characterization of iavs these diagnostic techniques were developed and used for subtyping or sequencing of novel viruses however due to the continuous circulation of h5nx hpai and other virus clades in avian species it is very difficult to control viral transmission in poultry 3 to effectively control and rapidly diagnose suspected infection on poultry farms it is important to develop a rapid diagnostic assay for the simultaneous detection of different h5 hpai viruses 20 in this study we tested our one-step multiplex method using clinical poultry samples to simultaneously detect pan-hpai and two h5 clades thus our one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay can be used for the screening of virus-infected field samples a total of 15

sequences were compiled and edited using the bioedit program wwwmbioncsuedubioeditbioedithtml based on their sequences all h5 hpai-positive field viruses were classified as the h5 hpai clade using highly pathogenic h5n1 clade classification tool in the influenza research database to develop the one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay a specific primer set and the probes for pan-h5 hpai and two clades 2344 or 2321 were designed in order to enhance the simultaneous detection specificity of a target gene the h5 hpai ha gene sequences from different years and various clades of h5 hpai strains were downloaded from the genbank database primers and probes for the most conserved regions of the ha gene figure 1 were designed to optimize our one-step multiplex qpcr three ha gene plasmids containing the h5 hpai ha genes of two clades were amplified and used as a quantitative standard in our system each plasmid was serially diluted 5  108 to 5  100 copies per microliter and the sensitivity of our primerprobe set was determined using the singleplex and multiplex qpcr assays targeting pan-h5 hpai clade 2344 or 2321 the standard curves generated for these targets under both qpcr conditions showed linearity r2  09918 to 09997 figure 2 also we showed that the detection limit under both qpcr conditions was 5  101 copies per microliter table 1 the cut-off for the cycle threshold of rt-qpcr was set to 35 to assess analytical specificity of the one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay strains of different subtypes or clades of influenza a virus as well as other avian or human origin viruses infectious bronchitis virus newcastle disease virus coronavirus-229e strain and parainfluenza virus 1 were tested as we expected all h5 hpai and two clade viruses were successfully detected while the other influenza a virus subtypes and viruses of other origin were not amplified by our multiplex rt-qpcr table 2 in addition the h5 lpai subtype viruses were not detected using our specific h5 hpai primerprobe set interestingly although the h5n1 hpai subtypes of aenvironmentkoreaw1502006 clade 22 and aduckvietnamncvd-16482012 clade 2321 are the same our primerprobe set detected only clade 2321 these results show that our multiplex rt-qpcr assay is highly specific and exhibits no cross-reactivity for h5 hpai and the other clades to detect h5 hpai in fecal samples using our one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay we obtained a total of 4350 fecal samples from domestic chickens with signs of respiratory illness in vietnam and viral rna was isolated from these samples a total of 68 samples were confirmed influenza positive by m-gene-specific rt-qpcr among the iav-positive clinical samples 51 samples were h5 hpai-positive and each clade was successfully analyzed using our one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay table 3 and figure 3 next we confirmed the sequence of all h5 hpai-positive samples using the universal ha sequencing primers forward 5-gcattggytaycatgcaaaya-3 and reverse 5-ttgctrtggtgrtayccataca-3 and classified each clade using the influenza research database interestingly when we have compared with sequencing analysis and clade identification using each amplicon the primers and probes for the pan-h5 hpai-specific and two clade-specific multiplex rt-qpcr assays were well-matched figure 3d these results show that our one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay could be a promising technique for specific discrimination of multiple h5 hpai viruses in field samples from infected avian species  since h5n1 hpai viruses was first identified in 1996 diverse subtypes of h5 hpai were classified global and domestic spread of these virus caused huge losses to the poultry industry 18 novel h5nx hpai viruses appeared due to reassortment of the ha gene with different na genes according to the who report 22 h5nx hpai viruses have been classified into 13 clades based on their ha sequences recently new clade classifications appeared 111 71 2131 2133 2211 2211a 222 2221 2321 2341 2343 and 2344 owing to the emerging hpai virus subtypes h5n2 h5n3 h5n5 h5n6 and h5n8 18 among several new clades two clades of h5 hpai virus 2344 and 2321 have been recently prevalent and dominant in asia such as china 23 south korea 24 and vietnam 25 in particular 2344 clade of h5 virus has spread to china and neighboring countries such as south korea 24 vietnam 25 and laos 26 between 2013 and 2016 despite many efforts to control the spread of h5 hpai viruses 27 in poultry such as development of a vaccine and diagnostic systems 28 viruses evolved and infected wild birds and domestic poultry in particular to effectively monitor and control h5nx hpai virus transmission a number of diagnostic techniques including virus isolation and conventional rt-qpcr have been reported 29 virus isolation is the gold standard for influenza virus diagnosis but it is time-consuming expensive and not suitable for discrimination of multiple hpai viruses the conventional rt-qpcr assay is well-known and useful for molecular detection of influenza viruses such as influenza virus subtyping and positive detection using matrix gene detection 30 in particular this method detects the fluorescence signal of a positive sample in real time due to using of the target-specific probeprimers resulting in high sensitivity and specificity therefore the rt-qpcr assay could be widely used as molecular diagnostic technology in clinical fields to detect h5 hpai virus and difference of h5 hpai clade viruses in clinical samples a multiplex rt-qpcr assay has been developed using several pairs of primers and probes 293132 however some drawbacks are the reduced specificity and sensitivity of the target gene amplification due to the nonspecific interaction among primers and probes in the same reaction 32 in this study novel primers and probes were designed for the pan-h5 hpai detection and the classification of two clades of h5 hpai 2344 or 2331 in field samples our one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay was successfully employed to amplify viruses and iav-positive field samples using novel primersprobes for the simultaneous detection of pan-h5 hpai and two clades without cross-reactivity to enhance the specificity of target detection we designed a new single primer set and each probe for the conserved sequences of h5 hpai after testing the iav-positive clinical field samples 51 were h5 hpai positive and the cycle threshold values of these positive samples ranged from around 20 to 24 moreover all h5 hpai-positive samples were sequenced and the results were verified by genbank blast processing interestingly the limit of detection of pan-h5 hpai and clades in the singleplex and multiplex rt-qpcr assays was the same when our new single primer set and each probe combination was used our one-step multiplex rt-qpcr method ensures highly specific and sensitive simultaneous detection of pan-h5 hpai and two clades of h5 hpai our method development focused on pan-h5 hpai and two clades of h5 hpai virus 2321 and 2344 which have been dominant in asia and present in eurasia and africa this detection platform provides useful screening of clinical samples from

nair et al 2010 walker et al 2013 accurate and rapid identification of the etiological agent is important for patient management and control of respiratory disease outbreaks garbino et al 2004 the clinical presentation of respiratory infections caused by various viral pathogens can be very similar hence etiological diagnosis is important coiras et al 2004 also there may be a possibility of coinfections occurring in pediatric and immunecompromised individuals respiratory viral infections have traditionally been diagnosed in the laboratory by culture of respiratory specimens and direct fluorescent assay dfa ginocchio 2007 nucleic acid amplification tests naat have been developed for classical as well as newly emerging respiratory viruses and have been shown to be more sensitive and time efficient than dfa or culture however testing for all respiratory viral targets using individual pcrs is expensive and laborious a conventional multiplex rtpcr would be a very useful tool in resource limited settings therefore multiplex pcr methods were developed with the aim of detecting different viruses simultaneously coiras et al 2004 bellaupujol et al 2005 kim et al 2009 choudhary et al 2013a the introduction of multiplex real time rtpcr assays has increased the efficiency of routine molecular diagnosis of respiratory viruses and has been shown to be cost effective gunson et al 2005 mahony et al 2009 auburn et al 2011 jansen et al 2011 the use of specific labeled probes ensures easy interpretation when used in a multiplex format however multiplexing of realtime rtpcr may reduce the assay sensitivity and is limited due to availability of few commercially available fluorophores and instrumentation fox 2007 a multiplex pcr followed by detection of products by suspension

and hku1 one kit of xtag rvp fast assay contains reagents for 96 tests additionally external controls need to be included in each run and for a full plate more than one control is recommended reagents for the nucleic acid extraction step are purchased separately the cost of testing the 18 viruses discussed in the present study for one sample by mrtpcr rtrtpcr and rvp fast assay was us 27 us 45 and us 92 respectively and this includes only reagents cost excluding labor cost the overall duration of the xtag rvp fast assay was 5 to 6 hr for 16 samples including one positive and one negative control 90 min for rna extraction 15 to 20 min for pcr setup 150 min for rtpcr 15 to 20 min for hybridization setup 45 min for hybridization and 10 to 15 min for reading on luminex instrument the overall duration of the real time rtpcr assay was 8 to 9 hr for 16 samples including one positive and one negative control 90 min for rna extraction 60 to 70 min for pcr setup 6 hr to run the rtpcr thrice on one instrument the overall duration of the mrtpcr assay was 6 to 7 hr for 16 samples including one positive and one negative control 90 min for rna extraction 30 to 40 min for pcr setup 3 hr to run the rtpcr and 60 to 90 min for gel run traditional methods of detection and identification of respiratory viruses like cell culture and immunofluorescence are labor intensive slow and are dependent on specimen quality nucleic acid amplification tests naat have shown increased sensitivity and quicker turnaround time compared to nonamplification tests arens et al 2010 the high detection rates of naats are due to the inclusion of a larger number of viral targets with increased sensitivity allowing detection of low copy numbers of different viruses mahony et al 2007 pabbaraju et al 2011 finally accurate diagnosis will optimize antiviral treatment and implementation of infection control and public health measures the xtag respiratory virus panel assay is based on suspension microarray technology which enables the detection of a large number of targets in a single reactions krunic et al 2007 merante et al 2007 the rvp fast assay provides a considerable reduction in time and less steps of post pcr manipulation from the first version of the assay merante et al 2007 the xtag rvp assay has been shown to offer results comparable to or superior to those of culturedfa and nucleic acid tests for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections mahony et al 2007 pabbaraju et al 2008 jokela et al 2012 the xtag rvp assay has shown the best sensitivity to common viral targets when compared to the resplex ii and multicodeplx assays when compared with culture baladallasat et al 2011 the xtag rvp assay has been also used successfully for the detection of etiological agents in outbreaks of respiratory illness wong et al 2009 in this study the performance of the inhouse developed conventional multiplex rtpcr with monoplex real time rtpcr and luminex xtag rvp fast assay was assessed by the retrospective testing of 310 respiratory clinical samples originally submitted for the diagnosis of influenza ah1n1pdm09 virus the overall sensitivity was 969 879 and 683 for mrtpcr rtrtpcr and xtag rvp fast assay respectively since bocavirus and adenovirus were not tested by multiplex rtpcr and real time rtpcr hence excluded for sensitivity calculation for these tests in this study we found that the xtag rvp fast assay is less sensitive than mrtpcr and rtrtpcr the overall rvp fast assay sensitivity was 788 reported by gadsby et al 2010 775 for all the targets reported by pabbaraju et al 2011 872 reported by kim et al 2013 while 33 reported by raymaekers et al 2011 pabbaraju et al 2008 reported rvp assay sensitivity and specificity as 912 and 997 respectively when their inhouse naats were considered as a gold standard in another study rvp fast assay showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 91 when compared with culture while multicodeplx showed 89 and 87 and resplex ii showed 89 and 94 respectively baladallasat et al 2011 popowitch et al 2013 reported sensitivity and specificity for xtag rvp fast as 844 and 999 respectively in the present study a lower sensitivity of rvp fast assay was observed compared to that reported in other studies this may be due to the fact that in this study we have compared the rvp fast assay against well standardized and robust molecular assays using clinical samples whereas most of the other studies have compared the rvp fast assay against cultures dfa using isolates another reason may be the sequence variation in the primerprobe binding regions between viruses circulating in india and other parts of the world in a recent study by synlab in germany httpwwwluminexcorpcomprodgroupspublicdocumentslmnxcorpp104-escv-2012-synlab-rvppdf 30 comparisons were made between their homebrew light cycler assay rvp fast v2 and rvp fast v2 extended amplification the rvp fast v2 assay performed well with quality control for molecular diagnostic qcmd samples which had ct values lower than 30 however for samples with ct values higher than 30 a considerable drop in sensitivity was observed to remedy this pcr cycles were increased by 3 cycles extended amplification to increase sensitivity the protocol for xtag rvp fast assay was not modified in the present study since it is a ce marked kit considering the entire detection spectrum the present study detected 622 samples positive by mrtpcr 564 by rtrtpcr and 445 by xtag rvp fast assay similar findings have been reported in previous studies using the rvp fast assay gadsby et al 2010 babady et al 2012 or the original rvp assay mahony et al 2007 pabbaraju et al 2008 gharabaghi et al 2011 the 78 coinfections were detected by mrtpcr 45 by rtrtpcr and 108 by rvp fast assay as shown in table ii similar coinfections were reported by others for rvp assay mahony et al 2007 pabbaraju et al 2008 gadsby et al 2010 jokela et al 2012 the rvp fast assay mainly failed to detect influenza a b rsv a b and piv3 viruses concordance between mrtpcr and rtrtpcr for influenza ah1n1pdm09 influenza b rsv a and b was 100 influenza a samples missed by rvp fast assay had mfi median fluorescent intensity values ranging between 150 and 300 the cut off value to consider positive for influenza a target was 300 mfi it was observed that the discordant results of the rvp negative samples were associated with relatively high ct values mean ct in rtpcr 34 the limitation of xtag rvp fast assay was that it does not subtype influenza a into h1n1pdm09 and the kit was not upgraded since the emergence of h1n1pdm09 upgrading of the xtag rvp fast assay to accommodate the subtyping of influenza a into h1n1pdm09 virus might increase the diagnostic value of the kit the lower sensitivity of influenza b was also reported by pabbaraju et al 2011 and suggested sequence variation in the hemagglutinin gene of flu b in the primer binding region gharabaghi et al 2011 reported influenza b sensitivity 649 for rvp fast assay the sensitivity of rvp fast assay for rsva rsvb and piv3 was 133 473 and 444 respectively gharabaghi et al 2011 reported rsva sensitivity 855 and rsvb 983 similar reports were published by other groups gadsby et al 2010 rand et al 2011 kim et al 2013 popowitch et al 2013 low sensitivity of rsv in rvp assay attributed to the high ct value in real time rtpcr and may be due to the genetic variation of the virus pabbaraju et al 2008 also observed that their discordant rsvs were of low titer as well the lower sensitivity in rvp fast assay for piv3 was also reported gharabaghi et al 2011 babady et al 2012 hmpv rhinovirus and piv4 were detected with lower sensitivity by rtrtpcr when compared with mrtpcr rvp fast assay and mrtpcr have combined rhinovirus and enterovirus targets these viruses clubbed together as rhvev to perform sensitivity of the tests real time rtpcr sensitivity for rhinovirus was 662 mrtpcr and rvp fast assay 872 respectively the reduced sensitivity may be because both mrtpcr and rvp fast assay detect rhinovirus and enterovirus while rtrtpcr specifically detected only rhinovirus sensitivity of rhvev in rvp fast assay was reported 93 by popowitch et al 2013 896 by gadsby et al 2010 a total 48 rhinovirusenterovirus positive samples were sequenced out of which 42 875 were confirmed as rhinovirus and six 125 as enterovirus by sequencing similar findings were also reported by others pabbaraju et al 2008 gadsby et al 2010 a relatively lower number of specimens were positive for coronaviruses parainfluenza and metapneumovirus in our sample set two coronavirus oc43 positive samples missed by mrtpcr had ct values of 33 and 35 in the rtrtpcr a significant limitation in the present study was the absence of influenza a h3n2 to evaluate the kit performance for detection of it therefore a larger number of positive specimens are required in order to fully assess the sensitivity of the rvp fast assay for all targets in addition to sensitivity and specificity ease of use required time and cost are important factors to consider when choosing a multiplex pcr each assay evaluated in this study had advantages and disadvantages the cost of testing the 18 viruses discussed in the present study for one sample by mrtpcr rtrtpcr and rvpfast assay was us 27 us 45 and us 92 respectively which include only reagents and consumables the overall duration of the rvp fast assay was 5 to 6 hr for real time rtpcr was 8 to 9 hr and mrtpcr was 6 to 7 hr similar observation for workflow and cost were reported for rvp fast assay by rand et al 2011 and babady et al 2012 luminex xtag rvp fast assay has the advantage of strict quality control and manufacturing practices which minimizes errors during testing of the samples luminex xtag rvp assay is an open pcr system and post amplification products are manipulated hybridization increasing the risk of potential laboratory contamination kim et al 2013 mrtpcr has disadvantage because it requires the visual inspection of products in gel and have a potential for amplicon contamination real time rtpcr offers decreased contamination risk more technical skill is required to perform xtag rvp fast assay and rtrtpcr than mrtpcr limitation of the present study was that we have not tested prospective samples in summary the inhouse developed mrtpcr and rtrtpcr showed better sensitivity specificity and is more cost effective compared to the rvp fast assay results of this study indicate that implementation of the inhouse developed mrtpcr for testing of respiratory samples will improve our rate of diagnosis of respiratory tract infections and can be used in resource limited settings  directional and reoccurring sequence change in zoonotic rna virus genomes visualized by time-series word count yoshiko wada kennosuke wada yuki iwasaki shigehiko kanaya toshimichi ikemura   because of the recent major threat to public health in west africa more than 1000 genomes of zaire ebolavirus ebov strains isolated from humans from 2014 to 2015 have been sequenced and the sequences are available from the ncbi virus variation database24 httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgenomevirusesvariationebola to study molecular evolutionary changes in ebov genomes in the current epidemic we obtained 1020 strains for which the isolated dates are given although we focused on full-length genomes a minor portion was relatively short in length or many unidentified n bases were included partly because of the stringent sterilization treatment obligated by the local government3 because these will give odd values of mono- and oligonucleotide compositions we focused on 935 genomes longer than 185 kb after omitting n bases which were derived from 244 guinea 156 liberia and 535 sierra leone strains to conduct the present spatiotemporal analysis 15 strains isolated from several other geographic areas were omitted we first analyzed time-series change in mononucleotide composition for strains isolated in the three areas separately figure 1a plots four mononucleotide compositions  in each genome according to the isolated day which started on march 17 2014 because mutations occur primarily as random processes mononucleotide compositions for strains isolated even around the same day clearly differed from each other which resulted in evident compositional diversity despite this diversity which should also be due to sequencing uncertainty linear regression lines appear to show a time-dependent increasing or decreasing trend a possible increase for c and g and a possible decrease for a and u this is consistent with the excess u-to-c mutations found by two groups23 the present study focused on time-series changes but not on data variations caused largely by random mutations and sequencing uncertainty and therefore average characteristics of strains isolated in a similar period were analyzed summing up the sequences isolated in one month and calculating an averaged mononucleotide composition for each month fig 1b this could be done because the genome sequence data were distributed rather evenly by area and month the average number of strains per month was 222 412 and 173 for guinea blue sierra leone green and liberia brown respectively we omitted the data for a few months for which no more than 5 strains were available in the respective area figure 1b shows a more conspicuous increasing or decreasing trend than fig 1a and the time-series increasing or decreasing trend revealed by the regression line for the elapsed months was the same among the three areas for all nucleotides except for an ambiguous case of g for guinea in more detail positive and negative directions of the regression line were primarily common among the three areas although the slope angle appear to differ table 1 lists pearsons correlation coefficients calculated separately for the three areas the highest negative 094 or positive 092 correlation among mononucleotides was observed for a or c respectively in liberia which corresponded to a decrease of 102 as or an increase of 114 cs per genome at the final stage of the current outbreak notably the increasing or decreasing trend detected by these averaged data for one month fig 1b is common to the result without averaging fig 1a in these regression analyses the strains that were isolated in the three areas were independently analyzed a separate regression analysis that could examine the statistical significance of directional changes from the epidemic start for all three areas was conducted by including the data of strains isolated at or near the beginning of the current epidemic ie 2014 march strains in guinea in liberia and sierra leone data the results thus obtained by the latter analysis were consistent with those obtained by the former and the null hypothesis ie no correlation was rejected at statistically significant levels in most cases as described in figure legend in detail next we analyzed each dinucleotide composition in the genomes grouped for each month the results presented in fig 2a table 1 and supplementary fig 1a show that a common increasing or decreasing trend was observed among the three areas for more than half of the sixteen dinucleotides correlation coefficients higher than 08 or less than 08 are colored in table 1 for nine of the ten colored dinucleotides the coefficient in the other two areas primarily shows the common directional trend these high correlation coefficients should reflect the evolutionary dependence of the genome sequences a decrease in uu and au and an increase in cc fig 2a are predictable even as a cumulative effect of their constituent mononucleotides fig 1b but an increase in ac cu gu and ug is not predictable as a simple cumulative effect and may indicate the characteristics of the contiguous sequence itself we thus calculated the ratio of the observed dinucleotide occurrence to that expected from the mononucleotide composition obsexp and found a decrease for uu and gc and an increase for gu ug ac and ua which was common among the three areas fig 2b and supplementary fig 1a the slope direction of the regression line was common among the three areas but the slope angle appeared to differ among the areas for a wide range of dinucleotides as well as for tri- and tetranucleotides data not shown a spatiotemporal word count can be conducted without specific assumptions or prior knowledge and visualizes viral evolutionary changes in an easily understandable way two distinct models can explain the common increasing or decreasing trend among the three areas which was observed for a wide range of mono- and oligonucleotides model 1 throughout the current ebov epidemic virus movement between the three areas was extensive therefore the time-dependent trend of directional changes in oligonucleotide composition was common among the areas model 2 even without the extensive mixing of viruses common directional changes can occur for example viruses inevitably depend on many host factors for their growth but human cells may not provide an ideal growth environment for invading viruses therefore common directional changes occur after invasions from nonhumans for supporting more efficient growth in human cells in this connection park et al3 reported there was no clear evidence for import or export of ebov across national borders after its initial introduction furthermore although an increasing or decreasing trend for a wide range of mono- and oligonucleotides is common among the three areas their actual composition  and the slope angle of the directional change often differ among the areas this observation is consistent with model 2 and the report by park et al3 but not with model 1 as discussed below from various aspects when considering the cellular environment differences between natural hosts bats and humans not only the low-molecular substances eg nucleotide pool but also the macromolecules eg proteins involved in viral growth must be considered additionally antiviral mechanisms78910 should differ between humans and natural hosts host macromolecules involved in viral growth either supporting or inhibiting should primarily recognize oligonucleotides such as several nucleotides or longer rather than mononucleotides hence we analyzed time-series changes in pentanucleotide 5-mer occurrences we first calculated correlation coefficients for all 1024 45 5-mers and sorted them by the averaged correlation coefficients for the three areas figure 3a and supplementary fig 1b show time-series patterns of 5-mers with evidently high or low correlation coefficients 384 or 50 of 1024 types 5-mers showed a common decreasing or increasing trend among the areas respectively examination of the ratio of the observed occurrences to those expected from the mononucleotide composition obsexp showed that directional changes of many 5-mers cannot be explained by a cumulative effect of mononucleotide changes data not shown as found for various dinucleotides when further examining the 5-mers showing the common directional change in more detail their actual occurrence level and slope of the regression line often differed among the areas fig 3a and supplementary fig 1b and the difference often became clearer compared to that for mono- and dinucleotides this cannot be explained by the aforementioned model 1 if the time-series directional change in mono- and oligonucleotide composition found for ebov is actually due to the necessity of supporting efficient growth in human cells model 2 such directional changes should be observed for other zoonotic rna viruses we next analyzed mers coronaviruses isolated in the recent epidemic starting in april 2012 in the middle east2526 the ebov outbreak analyzed above was initiated by a single virus strain being introduced from a nonhuman animal this virus was then transmitted among humans during the outbreak in contrast mers viruses were repeatedly transmitted from nonhumans mainly camels in this epidemic25 although its original natural host is thought to be bats26 because direct nonhuman hosts for different human isolates differ among isolates information on camel-derived strains in the current epidemic is important from the ncbi virus variation database24 we found 91 and 16 strains from humans and camels respectively with known isolated dates the total number of mers virus genomes is approximately one tenth of ebov genomes but their sequence length even after omitting n bases is mostly similar to its genome size ca 30 kb only one sequence that was evidently short 293 kb was omitted from this analysis we grouped sequences in each month and analyzed the averaged mono- and oligonucleotides from 2 to 5-mers for each month and host clear time-dependent increasing or decreasing trends were observed for a wide range of mono- and dinucleotides fig 4ab but the increasing or decreasing trend found for actual mono- and oligonucleotides clearly differed from ebov eg c and g decrease and u increases in mers viruses ebov is a negative-sense single-stranded rna virus and the sequences registered in the database and analyzed here were complementary to viral genome sequences but mers virus is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus and therefore genome sequences were analyzed this difference however cannot explain differences in directional changes in mono- and oligonucleotide composition of ebov and mers viruses figure 3b presents four 5-mers with a high increasing or decreasing trend eg during this 38-month epidemic approximately six uuuuus or four ccacus have been gained or lost per genome respectively the time-dependent gain of u5 fig 3b clearly differs from its loss for ebov fig 3a although the regression lines blue lines in figs 3b and 4 were calculated only for human strains occurrence data for camel strains brown were primarily positioned around the regression line thus fitting the previous report that mers viruses were repeatedly transmitted between camels and humans in the present epidemic25 because time-series directional changes in mono- and oligonucleotide compositions were observed for both ebov and mers viruses the directional change should occur for other zoonotic rna viruses we next analyzed influenza viruses for which a large number of sequences are available from the influenza research database27 for different human a subtypes epidemics of which have started independently at long intervals such as several decades importantly the aforementioned model 2 in which the common directional change between different viral populations is expected without extensive virus mixing is testable more rigorously than for the ebov outbreak which started from a single invasion in guinea and expanded to other countries furthermore we may examine the following important issue if a common directional change is observed what types of changes likely reoccur in future epidemics caused by invasions from natural reservoir hosts in addition to human a subtypes genome sequences of human b type which can currently infect humans but not birds and of various avian a subtypes were available the genomes of influenza a and b are composed of eight segments and we first selected ca 25000 strains with a full set of eight sequences categorized the full genome sequences according to host and serological type and grouped them in each year the sequence length cut-off was not included because the genome is composed of eight segments of various lengths and a simple satisfactory criterion for length cut-off could not be set alternatively because 20 times more sequences are available than for ebov we selected years with at least ten strains of one category to reduce the artefactual effects derived from sequencing uncertainty then to analyze time-series changes we selected human or avian a subtypes with more than five years fulfilling the above threshold ten strains per year the human b type also fitted these criteria in the case of h1n109161718 starting from 2009 and abbreviated ph1n1 in the database a sufficient number of sequences fulfilling the above threshold was available even per month and therefore ph1n1 sequences in each month were analyzed importantly this allowed the study of changes occurring within one outbreak in detail collectively we focused on thirteen subtypes three human and nine avian a subtypes and a human b type and first analyzed time-series changes in mononucleotide compositions three human subtypes of influenza a virus human h1n1 h3n2 and ph1n1 changed their a c and g with common increasing or decreasing trends among the three subtypes fig 5a despite different epidemics having started by independent invasions from nonhumans the gc increase in human a subtypes was previously reported by rabadan et al10 figure 5a shows that the a c and g move time-dependently apart from those of avian a subtypes sky blue and toward those of the human b type violet because the b type can currently infect humans but not birds this type has possibly adapted better to growth in human cells than a subtypes the directional change of human a subtypes apart from avian a subtypes and toward the human b type may visualize their evolutionary journey from each start of human-to-human transmission in the case of u human h1n1 blue and h3n2 brown have already reached the bs level and only ph1n1 green shows an increasing trend toward b a large number of ph1n1 strains isolated from 2009 to 2014 could provide detailed information on changes occurring within and after one outbreak because the averaged mononucleotide compositions for each month were analyzed in fact a horizontally long panel examining three human a subtypes fig 5b revealed that a monotonically increased from 2009 to 2012 but it abruptly lost half of the increase in 2013 arrowed followed by a possible partial recursion increase in 2014 c and g supplementary fig 2a also showed a monotonic decrease from 2009 to 2012 followed by an abrupt backset we next analyzed the di- to tetranucleotide compositions concerning correlation coefficients for the elapsed years in the case of h1n1 and h3n2 and for the elapsed months in the case of ph1n1 three subtypes show a common increasing or decreasing trend for thirteen of sixteen dinucleotides the top four cases for the absolute value of averaged correlation coefficients for the three subtypes were examined in fig 6a as observed for mononucleotides all three subtypes appeared to move from avian a subtypes toward the human b type a decrease in cg dinucleotides in au motifs during human-to-human transmission was previously reported11 detailed inspection of ph1n1 fig 6b showed a monotonic increase of aa from 2009 to 2012 was followed by an abrupt backset in 2013 arrowed here we discuss the backset occurring after one outbreak may relate to the differential slopes of directional changes observed for different subtypes figs 5 and 6 ph1n1 strains which are primarily derived from one outbreak show an evidently steeper slope than h1n1 and h3n2 strains derived from multiple outbreaks indicating a higher rate of ph1n1genome sequence changes the first discussion was whether ph1n1 had an evidently higher mutation rate than h1n1 and h3n2 we propose here that without introducing the higher mutation rate of ph1n1 its seemingly higher rate of genome sequence changes can be explained by the model that conforms to the abrupt backset that occurred after an outbreak when considering a viral infection spread the ratio of persons with or without proper resistance to the viral infection eg antibodies that are highly effective against the respective strain becomes important therefore the blooming strains and their close relatives in a certain outbreak especially in a pandemic may not be a very suitable strain for restarting the next outbreak because antibodies highly effective against the blooming strains are held by a large portion of humans less blooming strains that are less adapted to humans may become good starting strains for the next outbreak resulting in a backset after one outbreak as observed in figs 5b and 6b and supplementary fig 2 hence the evolutionary change focusing on strains belonging to a single outbreak looks higher than those belonging to multiple outbreaks giving a steeper slope to illustrate this interpretation we added hypothetical data of h3n2 strains belonging to one outbreak as a series of small light-brown dots representing the dinucleotide compositions hypothesized for individual months whose slope angle simply mimics that of ph1n1 although other various mechanisms must be included to explain the backset after one outbreak we propose that the steep slope of ph1n1 can be explained without introducing the higher mutation rate of ph1n1 a wide range of tri- and tetranucleotides also showed decreasing or increasing trends common among the three subtypes data not shown the common increase or decrease of mono- and oligonucleotides should reflect the convergent-type evolution occurring in independently evolving viruses which have invaded independently from nonhumans we predict that the time-dependent changes required for efficient growth in human cells will repeat with a significant probability after future invasions from natural reservoir hosts and that this view is most likely applicable to a wide range of zoonotic rna viruses next a time-series analysis was performed on long oligonucleotide occurrences long oligonucleotides are key elements of diagnostic rt-pcr primers2028 and nucleic-acid therapeutics eg sirnas19212223 when designing diagnostic and therapeutic oligonucleotides with long effectiveness for highly mutable viruses we have to understand fundamental features of time-series directional changes of long oligonucleotides and to predict changes that will reoccur with a high probability the sizes of pcr primers and therapeutic oligonucleotides range primarily from 15 to 30 nucleotides19212223 thus we analyzed 20-mer occurrences in genomes of three human influenza a subtypes which independently invaded from nonhumans of a total of 420 ca 11 trillion types ca 14 million types of 20-mers were found in these genomes importantly a time-series word count can analyze such big data without difficulty after calculating correlation coefficients for each 20-mer for each subtype we first selected all 20-mers having an evidently high or low correlation coefficient 08 or 08 in common for the three subtypes all five 20-mers thus selected had negative correlation coefficients and were found to be mutually overlapped ie these were components of one 24-mer figure 7a presents time-series occurrences for one 20-mer acagcagagugcuguggaug other four 20-mers gave practically the same decreasing pattern at the beginning stage of three independent epidemics most strains had one copy of the 20-mer but during the course of human-to-human transmission the copy number decreased in the viral population and were almost completely lost at the final stage in all three subtypes ie the strains having this 20-mer sequence progressively reduced their share in viral populations regardless of differences in subtypes we think that this common decrease reflects a certain inconvenience for efficient growth in human cells and will reoccur with a high probability after a future invasion we next discuss this common decrease in connection with sirna designs because of the social importance of influenza viruses varieties of sirnas have been designed as promising nucleic-acid therapeutics actually virsirnadb29 which have complied the experimentally validated sirna sequences contains 96 sirnas for influenza a viruses and their length ranges from 19 to 21 when we searched viral sirna sequences that were highly homologous to the 20-mers with an evident common increasing or decreasing trend with a blast search against virsirnadb we found that four 19-mer influenza a sirnas virsi1635 1640 1645 and 1650 which had the same sequence cagcagagugcuguggaug but were experimentally validated in different cell lines showed a complete match to the 19-mer sequence harbored by the aforementioned five 20-mers which are components of one 24-mer aggaacagcagagugcuguggaug although these five 20-mers gave practically the same decreasing pattern to that listed in fig 7a the compensatorily increased 20-mer responding to their decrease differed slightly in changed positions among the subtypes figure 7bc present patterns of the compensatorily increased 20-mers which had nonsynonymous and synonymous changes from the original 20-mer respectively for details see the legend this indicates that the sequence ranging over a certain length is possibly inconvenient for efficient growth in human cells ranges and that changes within the range can resolve the possible inconvenience since both synonymous and nonsynonymous changes were observed the possible inconvenience should not relate to protein sequence the information about the time-dependent directional change and the changed base should become important for designing sirnas with long effectiveness finding time-series directional changes in long oligonucleotide occurrences for a large number of influenza a genomes can provide a new refinement strategy for designing therapeutic oligonucleotides and diagnostic rt-pcr primers with long effectiveness three influenza a subtypes may not be sufficient to judge the reoccurrence of the change and therefore our group has started to analyze the time-series changes in experimentally validated sirna sequences by focusing on both human and avian strains an important issue is clarification of biological mechanisms responsible for directional changes in oligonucleotide occurrences after host changes if the mechanism is clarified reoccurrence in the future should become much clearly defined systematic analyses on a wide range of oligonucleotides with various lengths for the genomes of human and avian strains may give useful information about the possible mechanisms judging from the directional changes observed in ebov and ph1n1 outbreaks genome sequences from strains isolated within several months after a new invasion appear to give reliable information about the directional change if a large number of viral sequences becomes available an averaging even per week for strains that are isolated in properly assigned geographic areas may clarify time-dependent directional changes undoubtedly past sequences from the same or closely related viral genomes become important for comparison in the present study we focused on zoonotic rna viruses whose reservoir hosts are vertebrates but it is undoubtedly important to analyze other rna viruses spread by bugs eg ticks and mosquitos which have caused serious emerging infectious diseases such as dengue fever and zika virus disease3031 results obtained with time-series word count are easily understandable even for those unfamiliar with evolutionary biology when social importance of time-series word count of oligonucleotides becomes clear experts in various fields will participate actively huge numbers of genome sequences including those from disease-causing microbial strains have accumulated rapidly because of revolutionary development in sequencing technologies and of social importance in this era of big data accumulation participation of experts in big data analysis becomes increasingly important for interdisciplinary efforts against big threats presented by infectious microorganisms genome sequences of human zaire ebolavirus ebov and mers coronavirus strains were downloaded from the ncbi virus variation database24 httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgenomevirusesvariation on dec 20 and dec 31 2015 respectively because the number of mers virus sequences is small compared with the other two viruses analyzed a time-series analysis was conducted for the months having at least three strains and when the number of strains for a certain month was less than 3 these were combined with those of the nearest neighboring month that had the lower number of strains than the other neighbor from the ncbi influenza virus resource27 httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgenomesflu a total of ca 200000 segment sequences derived from ca 25000 influenza a and b virus strains were obtained on sep 1 2015 we calculated mono- and oligonucleotide occurrences in eight genome segments of influenza virus strains and summed up the occurrences for each strain to prevent possible misassignment from a large number of ph1n1 strains relatively small numbers of human classical h1n1 strains isolated from 2009 were omitted from the present analysis influenza virus is a negative-sense single-stranded rna virus and therefore the sequences analyzed are complementary to viral genome sequences computer codes are

pyrc ben berkhout lia van der hoek marc van ranst   coronaviruses are large enveloped positive stranded rna-viruses 1 the viral rna genome is 2732 kb in size capped polyadenylated and encapsidated in a helical nucleocapsid the envelope is studded with long petal-shaped spikes giving the virus particle a characteristic crown-like appearance three distinct groups of coronaviruses have been described based on serological affinity and genome sequence coronaviruses can infect humans and a variety of domestic animals and can cause highly prevalent diseases such as respiratory enteric cardiovascular and neurologic disorders 23 until recently only three human coronaviruses were thoroughly studied human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 group 2 and human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e group 1 were identified in the 1960s they are responsible for 1030 of all common colds and infections occur mainly during winter and early spring 4-7 a third novel human coronavirus sars-cov was identified as the causal agent during the 20022003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 8-10 phylogenetic analysis showed that the sars-cov does not closely resemble any of the three previously known groups of coronaviruses and therefore a tentative fourth group of coronaviruses was suggested 1112 however an early split-off of the sars-cov from the coronavirus group 2 lineage has also been suggested 1314 a new human coronavirus associated with respiratory illness hcov-nl63 was recently identified by a research team in the netherlands 15 the virus was isolated in january 2003 from a nasopharyngeal aspirate of a 7-month-old child suffering from bronchiolitis conjunctivitis and fever screening of specimens from patients with respiratory symptoms identified seven additional hcov-nl63 infected individuals both children and adults between december 2002 and february 2003 the complete viral genome sequence was determined the characteristic genome organisation of coronaviruses can be observed

nucleocapsid n the hemagglutinin-esterase he gene characteristic for group 2 coronaviruses is not present in hcov-nl63 sequence analysis demonstrated that hcov-nl63 shares 65 sequence identity with hcov-229e phylogenetic analysis confirmed that hcov-nl63 is a new group 1 coronavirus most closely related to hcov-229e and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv 15 shortly after van der hoek and colleagues published their discovery of the new human coronavirus hcov-nl63 a second research group described the characterization of essentially the same virus 16 the virus was isolated from a nose swab sample collected from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the netherlands in april 1988 real-time rt-pcr assays were designed for screening of respiratory tract samples four additional hcov-nl63 positive samples from children aged 3 months to 10 years were detected between november 2000 and january 2001 hcov-nl63 can be considered as a new important cause of respiratory illnesses and two different subtypes might be currently cocirculating in the human population 15 in this study we wanted to explore the incidence of hcov-nl63 infection in children diagnosed with respiratory tract infections in belgium we studied 309 isolates from 279 patients with severe respiratory symptoms collected from january 2003 until march 2004 at the university hospital in leuven belgium these isolates originated from bronchoalveolar lavages pharyngeal swabs nasopharyngeal aspirates and sputum samples routine diagnostic testing was performed for respiratory syncytial virus rsv influenza virus parainfluenza virus and adenovirus no prior amplification by cell culture was performed the results of diagnostic tests for rsv were negative for 244 isolates while 65 isolates were positive for rsv patients ranged in age from 1 month to 16 years with a mean age of 2 years the temporal distribution of the isolates corresponded to the yearly rsv epidemic period 236 samples were collected from january to june 2003 and 73 samples were recovered during the first trimester of 2004 figure 1a rna was extracted from the collected specimens by using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit

analysis were performed essentially as described above annealing conditions during the rt-pcr assay were modified the annealing temperature was set at 55c a pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay is a usefull tool to test for all coronaviruses in a clinical sample besides quick screening for several pathogens in one assay it supplies the possibility to identify previously unknown coronaviruses the consensus rt-pcr assay as described by stephensen et al designed to amplify all known coronaviruses is not able to detect hcov-nl63 because of several mismatches with the primer sequences 1517 we modified these consensus primers based on an alignment of the hcov-nl63 prototype sequence and 13 other coronavirus sequences figure 2 to determine whether the newly designed pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay efficiently amplifies a broad range of coronaviruses the rt-pcr assay was tested on cell culture supernatant of the four known human coronaviruses and three animal coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-oc43 hcov-229e sars-cov feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev and murine hepatitis virus mhv amplification of the expected 251 bp region was observed for all tested coronaviruses figure 3 the sensitivity of the pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay was assessed by testing tenfold dilutions of hcov-nl63 and hcov-oc43 rna while 50 copies of hcov-oc43 rna copies per l nasopharyngeal aspirate could be detected the sensitivity for hcov-nl63 was a bit lower ie 5  103 rna copies per l nasopharyngeal aspirate the pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay was used for screening of specimens from hospitalized patients with respiratory symptoms collected between january 2003 and march 2004 samples from which a 251 bp fragment could be amplified were further identified by sequencing using the pancoronavirus primers we studied 309 specimens with a temporal distribution that corresponded with the yearly rsv epidemic period figure 1a a total of 244 samples were found negative for rsv by diagnostic testing the 279 patients in this study comprised of 211 patients aged 2 years 756 68 aged 216 years 244 we detected hcov-nl63 in 7 samples 23 one positive sample was collected at the end of january 2003 and coinfection with rsv type b was present five of the positive samples were collected within a ten-day period at the end of february 2003 and one positive sample was collected at the end of february 2004 which showed coinfection with adenovirus and parainfluenza virus figure 1b table 1 the seven positive samples were obtained from one patient aged 1 month four patients of 1 year one patient of 2 years and one patient of 16 years the patient files showed that all subjects suffered from respiratory tract illness and some had underlying disease table 1 the seven hcov-nl63 positive respiratory samples were confirmed by alternative rt-pcr assays amplification of a fragment of the nucleocapside gene and orf1b was carried out sequence analysis of the n gene fragments and the orf1b fragments showed 98100 similarity to the prototype hcov-nl63 sequences available in the genbank database ay567487 ay518894 a third one-step rt-pcr was carried out for each positive sample to amplify part of the orf1a gene sequence analysis of the orf1a pcr-products revealed 99 sequence identity with both hcov-nl63 prototype sequences available in genbank a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed based on an alignment of the orf1a nucleotide sequences from the hcov-nl63 positive samples and the available hcov-nl63 sequences in genbank hcov-229e was used as an outgroup the dendrogram shows that all hcov-nl63 sequences cluster together but two subclusters can be observed figure 4 inspection of the two full genome hcov-nl63 sequences available in genbank demonstrates that especially the aminoterminal region of the spike protein can be very divergent therefore we decided to amplify this region to investigate the variability of these region in our patients an rt-nested pcr assay was used to amplify part of the s gene these partial spike sequences showed 98 similarity with the hcov-nl63 prototype strains an alignment of the s gene sequences from the belgian samples partial spike sequences from the positive samples identified in the netherlands data not shown and the prototype hcov-nl63 sequences was used to constitute a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree the neighbor-joining tree was evaluated by 500 bootstrap pseudoreplicates two clusters can again be observed figure 5 screening of our sample collection for the presence of hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e was also performed we detected hcov-oc43 in 7 of 309 samples 23 and hcov-229e in one sample 03 the seven hcov-oc43 positive samples were collected during the winter and early spring of 2003 and 2004 the sample in which we detected hcov-229e was collected in april 2003 the positive samples were confirmed by rt-pcr using specific hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e primer pairs that amplify part of the m gene 18 the hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e partial membrane sequences of the contemporary belgian strains showed 9799 similarity with the hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e prototype sequences in genbank rsv influenza viruses adenoviruses and parainfluenzaviruses are probably the most important viral agents of severe respiratory diseases however a substantial part of respiratory tract infections can not be attributed to any known pathogen underlying conditions and immunosuppression largely determine the impact of respiratory viruses on individuals 19 the common cold viruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e have also been associated with more severe lower respiratory tract conditions in infants and immunocompromised patients 20-23 the clinical symptoms associated with hcov-nl63 infections still need to be determined but there are some indications that hcov-nl63 can cause severe respiratory illnesses in children and immunocompromised adults 1516 we detected hcov-nl63 using a pancoronavirus rt-pcr in patients suffering from relatively severe respiratory diseases necessitating hospitalization these positive samples were collected from children aged 1 month to 16 years two patients suffered from severe underlying disease one patient suffered from smith-lemli-opitz syndrome a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to a primary enzymatic defect in the cholesterol metabolism a second patient was diagnosed with vater a syndrome characterized by the sporadic association of specific birth defects or abnormalities such as vertebrae and vascular anomalies anal atresia trachea and esophagus problems and renal anomalities all hcov-nl63 infected patients established a complete recovery from their respiratory symptoms one-step rt-pcr assays were used to detect and confirm these positive samples results from epidemiological surveys conducted in the 1970s have led to the conclusion that human coronaviruses are distributed worldwide and circulate during seasonal outbreaks 22 our results indicate that hcov-nl63 is the causal agent in a significant portion of respiratory diseases of unknown etiology we detected hcov-nl63 in respiratory samples collected in february 2003 with a frequency of 71 and during february 2004 with a frequency of 25 these results seem to support the tendency of human coronaviruses to circulate mainly during the winter season 724 however in this study sampling was only performed from january to may during the yearly rsv epidemic period while no samples from the summer and autumn months were screened the first publication on hcov-nl63 showed that the virus circulated in amsterdam during the winter months of 20022003 15 more recently another set of amsterdam samples was screened obtained during the winter of 20012002 and 20032004 hcov-nl63 was found in one trachea sample obtained in february 2002 and in two oropharyngeal aspirates from december 2003 and january 2004 respectively data not shown combined with the data that we present here from belgium these findings confirm that hcov-nl63 reappears each winter season similar to the previously known respiratory viruses recently research teams from australia japan and canada have submitted partial hcov-nl63 sequences to the genbank database ay600442-ay600446 ay662694-ay662698 ay675541-ay675553 this indicates that this newly discovered human coronavirus has a worldwide distribution sequence analysis of the highly conserved nucleocapsid region showed that the belgian isolates are similar to the two prototype hcov-nl63 complete genome sequences in genbank isolated in the netherlands in 1988 and 2003 furthermore phylogenetic analysis of part of the orf 1a region of our patients showed the same subclusters of hcov-nl63 that were described previously 15 figure 4 this finding supports the suggestion that several hcov-nl63 subtypes with distinct molecular markers are cocirculating also in belgium a large insert in the 5 part of the s gene of hcov-nl63 compared with hcov-229e has been described 1516 both hcov-nl63 complete genome sequences show only 89 sequence identity in this spike insert region which implies that there are at least two different hcov-nl63 subtypes sequence analysis of this spike insert region revealed that our samples show similarity to both prototype hcov-nl63 subtypes which was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis the partial s gene sequences cluster together with the two prototype hcov-nl63 sequences in two different groups figure 5 this confirms that the hcov-nl63 subtypes first isolated in 1988 and 2003 are cocirculating when analysing the dendrograms based on orf1a and s gene sequences a discordance in the clustering pattern of some hcov-nl63 isolates eg hcov-nl and nl-p223 can be observed suggesting a possible recombination event further research of complete genome sequences of these isolates is required drawing conclusions based on phylogenetic analysis of one single gene therefore requires caution as the true phylogeny can only be demonstrated by analysing complete genome sequences screening of our sample collection for the presence of hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e revealed seven hcov-oc43 positive samples and only one hcov-229e positive sample all positive samples were isolated during winter and early spring which is concordant with the results of previous epidemiological studies hcov-oc43 infected samples were mainly identified during february 2003 and february 2004 figure 1b these data show that the epidemic seasons of hcov-oc43 and hcov-nl63 coincide the positive samples were collected from children aged 1 to 12 years whom all suffered from respiratory symptoms the very low detection rate of hcov-229e compared with the frequent detection of hcov-nl63 might imply that hcov-nl63 closely related to hcov-229e is currently more important as a causal agent of respiratory diseases at the moment there are no data concerning cross-neutralization between hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 in theory such cross-neutralization might be possible since both viruses are relatively closely related species belonging to coronavirus group 1 antigenic cross-reactivity has already been demonstrated between sars-cov and group 1 coronaviruses tgev fipv and ccov 25 the development of a pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay using a primer set that matches all known coronaviruses might be useful for the identification of new coronaviruses this pancoronavirus rt-pcr-assay can also be used as a diagnostic tool to detect any of the four currently known human coronaviruses in clinical samples human coronavirus nl63 is a new important respiratory pathogen that can cause severe respiratory infections in children sequence analysis of the hcov-nl63 isolates detected in our study demonstrates that our belgian isolates can be classified into two subtypes corresponding to the two prototype hcov-nl63 sequences isolated in the netherlands in 1988 and 2003 our findings indicate that these two subtypes may currently be cocirculating the authors declare that they have no competing interests em conceived of the study and

reverse transcription pcr assay for simultaneous detection of sixteen human respiratory virus typessubtypes jin li shunxiang qi chen zhang xiumei hu hongwei shen mengjie yang ji wang miao wang wenbo xu xuejun ma   viral respiratory tract infections are a common cause of hospitalization and mortality in infants and young children influenza a influenza b parainfluenza human rhinovirus adenovirus respiratory syncytial virus metapneumovirus and coronavirus are recognized as viral agents associated with respiratory tract infections 13 therefore there is a need for a rapid and sensitive differential diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens to prevent nosocomial infections and to minimize unnecessary antibiotic usage 46  existing standard nonmolecular diagnostic methods such as viral culture and immunofluorescence dfa are time-consuming labor intensive or have low sensitivity 7 8 accordingly molecular techniques are increasingly accepted for diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections in the last few years multiplex rt-pcr assays have been developed to detect respiratory viruses 9 and some have been commercialized such as xtag rvp from luminex 10 11 multicode plx rvp from eragen biosciences 12 and resplex ii from qiagen 13  in our previous study a multiplex pcr based on the genomelab gene expression profiler gexp analyzer had been shown to be effective for the detection of pandemic influenza a h1n1 virus 14 nine serotypes of enteroviruses associated with hand foot and mouth disease 15 and sixteen different respiratory virus typessubtypes in a single tube 16 however these methods are not likely to be widely adopted in provincial centers for disease control and prevention due to the limited availability of gexp equipment therefore in this study a two-tube multiplex reverse transcription pcr assay twotube assay to detect sixteen respiratory viruses based on the amplicon size differences using automated electrophoresis system is described one tube is used for the simultaneous detection of nine respiratory viruses including influenza a virus flua influenza b virus flub seasonal influenza a virus subtypes h1n1 sh1n1 parainfluenza virus type 1 piv1 human rhinovirus hrv coronavirus subtypes oc43 cov oc43 coronavirus subtypes 229e cov 229e coronavirus subtypes hku1 cov hku1 and adenovirus adv another tube is used for the simultaneous detection of seven respiratory viruses including parainfluenza virus type 2 piv2 parainfluenza virus type 3 piv3 respiratory syncytial virus a rsva respiratory syncytial virus b rsvb coronavirus subtypes nl63 cov nl63 human metapneumovirus hmpv and human bocavirus hbov as the two-tube assay uses the qiaxcel automated electrophoresis system which is accessible in most of provincial centers for disease control and prevention in china this two-tube assay may have greater potential for the routine surveillance of respiratory virus infection in china and to improve the capacity for emergency management a total of 247 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected in the childrens hospital of beijing china during june 2008 and march 2010 from hospitalized children under two years of age presenting acute lower

shandong and inner mongolia the specimens were collected within 5 to 7 days after symptoms onset patients with bacterial infections were excluded all aspects of the study were performed in accordance with national ethics regulations and approved by the institutional review boards of the center for disease control and prevention of china childrens parents were apprised of the studys purpose and of their right to keep information confidential written consent was obtained from childrens parents total rnadna was extracted from 200 l of clinical sample using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit qiagen hilden germany the extracts were eluted into 50 l of dnase- and rnase-free water and stored at 80c nine pairs of chimeric primers 17 were added to tube 1 to detect nine respiratory viruses and eight pairs of chimeric primers were added to tube 2 to detect seven respiratory viruses one pair of internal control primer and one pair of universal primers were added to both tubes the sequence from human genome rnase p gene was used as an internal control primer for the specimens 16 the primers sequences the target genes the amplicon sizes and primer working concentrations are listed in table 1 one-step rt-pcr kit qiagen hilden germany was used for the amplification a total of 25 l pcr mixture containing 2 l of extracted rna and varied primer concentrations table 1 was subjected to the following conditions 50c for 30 min 95c for 15 min followed by 10 cycles of 95c for 30 s 55c for 30 s and 72c 30 s 10 cycles of 95c for 30 s 65c for 30 s 72c for 30 s 25 cycles of 95c for 30 s 48c for 30 s and 72c for 30 s and a final incubation of 72c for 3 min 15 and the reactions were analyzed on the qiaxcel automatic electrophoresis using qiaxcel dna high-resolution kit the specificity of the two-tube assay on all viral targets was tested individually in the two multiplex reactions under the experimental condition as described previously cell-cultured virus stocks contained in nattrol respiratory validation panels 2 natrvp-2 zeptometrix buffalo new york usa were used as the positive controls of flua flub sh1n1 piv1-3 hrv adv rsva rsvb hmpv cov 229e and cov oc43 to validate the specificity specimens genotyped previously 18 19 were used as positive controls of hbov hku1 and cov nl63  to determine the analytical sensitivity of the assay serial dilutions of viral rna transcripts of all rna viruses and serial dilutions of the plasmids containing the adv and hbov target sequence were analyzed by the two-tube assay the pcr products were cloned into a pgem-t vector which was used to transform dh10b cells the plasmid dna was extracted with an ezna plasmid mini kit i omega ga usa the rna copy number was calculated after measuring the concentration of the rna transcribed in vitro using a t7 large-scale rna production system promega wisconsin usa for the dna viruses adv and hbov the in vitro transcription was omitted the sensitivity of the two-tube assay was examined by using premixed quantitative viral rna transcripts or plasmids the personnel responsible for reading these and other assays were experienced staff with basic training in microbiology

the bio-plex 200 system bio-rad ca usa and the median fluorescence intensity mfi was determined  the additional targets detected only by the two-tube assay were confirmed by independent pcr and sequencing the sequencing was performed using t7 and sp6 sequence primers on ab solidtm 40 system applied biosystems usa and compared with the sequences in genbank for pathogen identification by using the blast algorithm the additional targets detected only by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay were resolved using remaining extracts with the seeplex rv15 ace detection kit seegene seoul korea 21 which contained a b and c sets of primers for detection of 15 respiratory viruses according to the manufacturers instructions all statistical analyses were performed using statistical package for social sciences spss software version 130 for windows the 
2-test and fishers exact test were conducted to measure the detection agreement of two-tube assay with the luminex xtag rvp fast assay and confirmed results the expected size of each virus typesubtype-specific amplicon was observed and separated clearly from the other viral targets on qiaxcel automatic electrophoresis for all of the positive controls no mispriming primer dimer or other amplification in the negative controls was observed in either tube figure 1 the qiaxcel dna high resolution kit is capable of resolving amplicons with as little as 5 bp size difference the smallest size difference in this test was 10 bp for the viral targets that used clinical specimens as positive controls hbov cov hku1 and cov nl63 a single pcr product was detected in addition to the internal control peak 126 bp  the sensitivity of the assay was evaluated for each virus typesubtype individually using serial tenfold dilutions ranging from 10 to 105 copies of cloned pcr products in both of the two tubes the limit of detection for hrv piv2 piv3 rsva hbov and adv was 20 copies per reaction and 200 copies per reaction for the other 10 virus typesubtypes assayed in this study  the sensitivity of two-tube assay when all the viral targets were present was also tested the detection sensitivity in tube 1 with 9 pre-mixed viral targets was 2000 copies per reaction and 200 copies per reaction in tube 2 with 7 premixed templates figure 2 all the comparative detections were double-blind tests performed by trained staff in our laboratory all of the 247 specimens assayed with the luminex xtag rvp fast assay were retested by the two-tube assay the two assays detected presence of at least one of the 16 assayed viruses in 194 specimens and the two assays both detected virus in 181 specimens the two-tube assay detected virus in 8 specimens that were negative in the luminex xtag rvp fast assay 2 adv 3 rsvb 2 hrv and 1 piv3 and 5 specimens had a positive detection of hrv only by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay the luminex xtag rvp fast assay identified 111 specimens to be coinfections 83 of them 7477 were in complete agreement between both assays and detection of 13 viruses in 12 specimens was missed by the two-tube assay additional 14 viruses in 14 coinfected specimens were detected only by the two-tube assay and 2 coinfection specimens no 28 and no 118 gave inconsistent results between the two assays table 3 as shown in table 2 there were 40 viral infections identified only by the two-tube assay and 21 viral infections found only by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay the infection events not detected by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay included piv3 n  2 hrv n  15 hmpv n  1 adv n  11 rsva n  1 and rsvb n  10 thirty-two of these undetected targets were found in coinfections and the remaining 8 targets 2 adv 3 rsvb 2 hrv and 1 piv3 were single-target positive specimens by the two-tube assay the two-tube assay failed to detect the following viral infections n  21 sh1n1 n  2 hrv n  13 adv n  1 and hbov n  5 sixteen of the 21 specimens were coinfections and the remaining 5 targets were positive only for hrv specimens because the hrv primers used in the luminex xtag rvp fast assay were able to amplify both hrv and enterovirus the specimens positive for hrv detected only by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay could be enteroviruses the sensitivity

a reference are shown in table 2 all of the 40 additional targets detected only by the two-tube assay were confirmed by sequencing as true positives for those specimens with discordant results by the two-tube and rvp assays the seeplex rv15 ace detection kit was used to resolve the discrepancy table 3  the confirmed results were defined as the results detected by at least two of the three pcr assays 22 23 or the results of sequencing the sensitivity specificity negative prediction value npv positive prediction value ppv the accordance rate and the kappa value of each virus for the two-tube assay when compared to the confirmed results as a reference are shown in table 4 in this study a novel two-tube assay based on the qiaxcel capillary electrophoresis to replace gexp has been evaluated for the potential application in routine laboratory testing of respiratory viruses in china under optimized working condition the two-tube assay revealed good specificity without nonspecific amplification using size detection system though conventional validation of specificity is usually done by probe detection hybridization nested pcr and sequencing the two-tube assay achieved a sensitivity of 20200 copies per reaction when assayed individually for each virus typesubtype and 2000 copies when 9 viral targets were present in tube 1 and 200 copies when 7 viral templates were present in tube 2 these results suggest the utility of the two-tube assay for the detection of multiple respiratory virus infections for laboratories not equipped to perform liquid chip-based multiplex assays the 247 specimens from hospitalized children showed a high prevalence of infection and co-infection with the common respiratory viral pathogens hrv was found most frequently followed by rsvb the major discrepancies between the two-tube assay introduced in this study and the luminex xtag rvp fast assay were found for the detection of hrv adv hbov rsvb and sh1n1 kappa    0770 0773 0907 0913 and 0929 resp table 2 all of the hrv positive samples including 15 detected only by two-tube assay were confirmed by sequencing to be positive for hrv a the 13 hrv-positive specimens detected only by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay could be enteroviruses because of the luminex rvp fast assay detecting enterovirus the hev component of the hevhrv after resolved by the seeplex rv15 ace detection kit three of them were truly discordant for adv seven specimens identified as positive only by the two-tube assay were shown via sequencing to be adv c and 4 were adv b1 only one adv-positive specimen was missed by two-tube assay for hbov five specimens detected as positive only by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay were also negative by the seeplex assay the other 14 positive samples detected only by two-tube assay 10 rsvb 2 piv3 1 rsva and 1 hmpv were confirmed by sequencing as true positives for sh1n1 all of the flua positives were sequenced and 16 of 20 were sh1n1 the two-tube assay failed to detect 2 of the 16 sh1n1 positives the detection results of coronaviruses cov hku1 cov nl63 cov 229e and cov oc43 influenza flua flub piv1 and piv2 were completely consistent between the two assays in summary no false positives were found by the two-tube assay and a total of 6 false negatives occurred hrv n  3 sh1n1 n  2 and adv n  1 the two-tube assay was more sensitive than the luminex xtag rvp fast assay for the detection of hrv a rsvb adv b1 and adv c the overall detection rate of the two-tube assay for each virus was comparable to that of the luminex xtag rvp fast assay kappa    075 demonstrating the high sensitivity and specificity of the two-tube assay in the analysis of clinical samples the two-tube assay as confirmed by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay revealed that almost 80 of the respiratory specimens tested were positive for at least one viral infection and viral coinfections were frequent the overall co-infection rates of the two-tube assay and the luminex xtag rvp fast assay were 4858 120247 and 4494 111247 respectively compared with other similar reports 9 2426 the extremely higher co-infection rate found by both assays might be due to the difference in the tested population and possible nosocomial infections in the hospital  the routine use of extensive testing by methods such as the two-tube assay should make large studies of the clinical relevance of single and multiple respiratory virus infections more feasible the clinical relevance of the outcome of multiplex pcr tests for respiratory viruses is not yet fully determined in one study of children with rsv infection higher fever longer hospital stays and more frequent use of antibiotics were associated with multiple infections 27 for some agents such as influenza a and b virus a positive test may provide the basis for antiviral treatment 28 it has been suggested that a rapid etiologic diagnosis of viral rti could reduce unnecessary prescription of antibiotics but this remains to be shown 28 two distinct advantages of the two-tube assay are the short assay time and the low cost the assay requires 5-6 hours to complete 100 samples including a half hour to prepare pcr mixture the whole rt-pcr 3 hours and the detection on the qiaxcel automatic electrophoresis 12 tests15 minutes while using other liquid chip-based assays might take an entire workday 29 the cost for two-tube assay is 10test including the rt-pcr kit and the consumables of detection versus at least 120test 29 using other liquid chip-based assays 29 in conclusion the two-tube assay developed in this study using automatic capillary electrophoresis is a rapid cost-effective method with high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of respiratory virus infection and it is demonstrated to have

 time to first result from sample preparation to detection of rt-pcresi-ms was 8 h 1 h of rna extraction 4 h of rt-pcr and 3 h of processing in esi-ms the estimated throughput of rt-pcresi-ms was 300 samples with 2 technicians and 24 working hours which represented 1080 pcr reactions this study was a hospital-based retrospective pilot proof-of-concept study designed to demonstrate the capacity and to determine the performance of the novel rt-pcresi-ms platform on mock-up samples and previously frozen clinical samples compared to clinical virology assays our study showed that this novel assay was rapid and able to detect and subtype multiple respiratory pathogens in the hospital with 879 accuracy compared to conventional clinical virology assays our study also indicated that pathogens not detectable by traditional clinical virology methods could be successfully detected by the rt-pcresi-ms platform the rt-pcresi-ms platform has several advantages including rapid turnaround time and a more detailed pathogen characterization ie relative semiquantification typing and subtyping of species versus conventional culture methods the current common diagnostic methods in our clinical virology laboratory are culture-based which may take days to yield results and are labor-intensive and expensive anzueto and niederman 2003 although some rapid antigen tests offer faster detection times their individual lower sensitivity and specificity limit their clinical utility as a sole methodology ginocchio 2007 the rt-pcresi-ms platform has the capability to detect multiple pathogens efficiently and with high sensitivity as well as the ability to determine the quantity of pathogens which would be potential biomarkers of infection course or severity however further prospective validation study will be needed to determine clinical performance of this assay while determining the performance of novel assays similar problems have appeared for the discordant analysis of results between the new assays and reference standard tests some researchers confirmed result of the novel assays discordant to the conventional culture or rapid antigen test by another multiplex rt-pcr assay liolios et al 2001 pabbaraju et al 2008 it remains controversial regarding how to examine a potentially more accurate novel assay versus the current alloyed standard doring et al 2008 proposed that clinical evidence of infections should be included in the validation of the novel nucleic acid test however our study design did not permit detailed clinical data collection we recognize several limitations of our design first the operation of rt-pcresi-ms was performed almost a year after the initial tests done in clinical virology utilizing excess npa obtained from clinical virology resulted in some specimens not being processed until more than a year after collecting them from patients although the effect of length of storage of npa has been shown to be minimal within 2 months ward et al 2004 the impact of longer periods of storage remains unknown ward et al 2004 demonstrated that multiple freezingthawing cycles did not significantly alter the concentrations measured before freezing the influenza samples while frisbie et al 2004 indicated influenza rna could degrade in the 70 c freezer and may result in some loss of sensitivity the second limitation is that we could not send every specimen for secondary analyses because of insufficient volume of some samples this is an inherent limitation of the retrospective design used here however because almost half of the discordant results was verified by another pcr-based method 12 out of 25 it might have little impact on the estimate future study is merited to perform parallel comparison on every sample by another reference test eg another pcr-based method to better characterize the performance of the platform third we could not test the performance of rt-pcresi-ms on every subtype of clinically relevant respiratory viruses because of the design of the study for those viral subtypes not demonstrated in this pilot study ie parainfluenza types 2 and 4 adenovirus types a and df further study will be required to determine the performance of this novel platform lastly we only performed 5 repeats in the lod experiment in which we utilized the 100 detection 55 criteria to determine the lod but not the 95 detection rule that generally applied in lod studies although the fewer repeats in our study may have limitation in precision of the lods the 100 detection still should be considered a conservative estimate in this pilot study that could provide some evidence for further studies in conclusion we demonstrated that the innovative rt-pcresi-ms technology could rapidly and accurately detect and subtype most viruses identified by conventional virologic methods detection of conventional viruses missed by clinical virology and unconventional viruses required additional confirmatory testing to further determine the performance characteristics the rt-pcresi-ms method is a promising diagnostic platform for the rapid identification of conventional and unconventional viruses and

infectious disease dynamics eg pedersen  fenton 2007 graham 2008 telfer et al 2010 johnson et al 2015 gorsich et al 2018 individuals are often coinfected by a diverse infracommunity of pathogens and interactions between pathogens can both alter infection patterns cattadori et al 2008 lass et al 2013 susi et al 2015 and influence disease outcomes moss et al 2008 munson et al 2008 knowles 2011 wejse et al 2015 pathogens infecting individuals in the first years of life may impact infection by subsequent pathogens fenton 2008 randall et al 2013 rynkiewicz et al 2015 aivelo  norberg 2018 budischak et al 2018 for example endemic pathogens that compete for the same resources as epidemic pathogens and can reduce the likelihood of infection randall et al 2013 or conversely facilitate infection via immune suppression eg geldmacher  koup 2012 the sequence in which pathogens infect an individual or priority effects have been experimentally shown to be important in shaping coinfection dynamics in a variety of systems eg hoverman et al 2013 halliday et al 2017 yet are rarely demonstrated in nonexperimental contexts how priority effects and pathogen traits eg transmission mode affect the nature and frequency of associations between endemic and epidemic pathogens ultimately shaping pathogen infracommunities is a knowledge gap that has significant consequences for understanding patterns of infection munson et al 2008 telfer et al 2010 ezenwa  jolles 2015 halliday et al 2017 quantifying associations between pathogens from observational data and inferring interactions from these patterns however is a methodological challenge fenton et al 2014 discriminating between positive ie two pathogens are more likely to occur together or negative associations ie two pathogens are less likely to occur together between pathogens in populations is complicated by the short time window that a pathogen is shedding and thus detectable with molecular methods and by potentially confounding host immune environments tompkins et al 2011 this is particularly the case for microparasites where pathogen detection often relies on serology and thus without resampling the same individual the precise timing of exposure cannot be estimated detection of pathogens that form chronic infections may be more straightforward as the infection is active for longer periods but deducing pathogen associations is difficult without extensive longitudinal data fenton et al 2014 hellard et al 2015 identifying whether two pathogens are associated due to hosthabitat preferences the increasing likelihood of exposure with age or are a product of a negative eg competition or positive eg facilitation interactions is methodologically challenging poulin 2007 johnson  buller 2011 fenton et al 2014 hellard et al 2015 clark et al 2016 identifying associations that could represent candidate interactions based on observational data can not only provide a basis for experiments to test potential interactions but also provide novel insights into pathogen infracommunity dynamics detecting associations between pathogens is also likely to depend on taxonomic and spatial scales that are seldom considered arajo  rozenfeld 2014 stutz et al 2018 studies commonly aggregate pathogen data to genus level but associations between pathogens can be subtype or genotypespecific eg wejse et al 2015 benesh  kalbe 2016 brook et al 2017 for example individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus subtype 1 hiv1 are four times more likely to become coinfected with tuberculosis compared to individuals with hiv2 wejse et al 2015 beyond subtype or genus genotypespecific associations have been demonstrated in snails infected by trematodes louhi et al 2015 and in rodents infected by bartonella bacteria brook et al 2017 infracommunity dynamics are also likely to vary with spatiotemporal scale in general associations between freeliving species are more apparent at scales where interactions occur compared to broader spatiotemporal scales eltonian noise hypothesis peterson et al 2011 arajo  rozenfeld 2014 but it remains unclear if this is true for pathogens nonetheless for crosssectional datasets important patterns may be missed unless multiple spatiotemporal scales are considered ovaskainen et al 2017 to overcome these challenges analytical approaches that can quantify associations between pathogens whilst controlling for potential confounding factors are required to assess the role of associations in shaping pathogen infracommunities recent applications of network theory to parasite community ecology provide an opportunity to move beyond the pairwise associations between two pathogens clark et al 2016 aivelo  norberg 2018 stutz et al 2018 network measures have frequently been used to study food webs but are increasingly applied to pathogen infracommunities where nodes are pathogens and edges represent pathogen cooccurrences within the host vaumourin et al 2015 networks are modular if pathogens cooccur more frequently in particular groups nested if pathogens frequently share interaction partners across the network or segregated if the inverse is true strona  veech 2015 ulrich et al 2017 if for example networks are segregated targeted control of one keystone pathogen may lead to coextinction of other pathogens in a module pedersen  fenton 2007 sterberg et al 2013 if a network is nested perturbations to the pathogen infracommunity may spread throughout the network griffiths et al 2014 although pathogen cooccurrence networks are valuable for quantifying broad structural patterns they do not account for environmental or host factors pathogen traits or differences in spatial or temporal scale joint species distribution models jsdms fill this gap by simultaneously assessing environmental influences and interspecific cooccurrences across multiple scales using hierarchical bayesian mixed models warton et al 2015 ovaskainen et al 2017 here we use both cooccurrence networks and jsdms to examine the structure of pathogenpathogen networks and quantify pathogen associations while controlling for environmentalhost factors and scales we include information on pathogen traits such as transmission mode to assess what role they played in the distribution of each pathogen we collate 10 years of crosssectional data on endemic and epidemic pathogens in 105 african lions panthera leo as well as extensive host and environmental data from the serengeti lion project slp packer et al 2005 the slp datasets provide a unique opportunity to understand pathogen cooccurrence networks in a wild population while controlling for group individual and environmental characteristics we use this data to ask the following interlinked questions at two levels of taxonomic resolution
to what degree is the pathogens cooccurrence network of serengeti lions nested or segregatedafter accounting for environmentalhost factors and spatiotemporal scale is the type of endemic pathogen an individual is infected by early in life associated with exposure to epidemic pathogens later in lifeare there significant endemicendemic or epidemicepidemic pathogen cooccurrences
 because we could not directly determine the order of infection events from crosssectional data in isolation we used ageprevalence relationships in combination with the natural history of each pathogen to estimate probable timing of events we describe an analytical pathway that can assess broad network structure and quantify pathogen associations across multiple scales that can generally be applied to understand infectious disease dynamics the cooccurrence network detects clusters of pathogen sharing amongst individuals and screens for disconnected nodes pathogens that rarely cooccur with others while the jsdm approach was used to quantify pathogenpathogen associations to assess the plausibility of these putative interactions we compare our findings to similar mammalian pathogens in experimental studies detecting pathogen cooccurrences not only provides novel insights into pathogen infracommunity dynamics but also helps aide surveillance efforts in the field and generate testable hypotheses that can be answered in laboratory experiments serological testing and quantitative pcr qpcr were performed to detect endemic and epidemic pathogens from blood samples taken from lions in the serengeti national park tanzania from 1984 to 1994 in total 394 individuals were sampled throughout this period but our analysis was restricted to the 105 individuals tested for the full suite of 10 pathogens table 1 pathogen natural history table s1 number of individuals tested per year included in the analyses nomadic individuals ie lions that were not resident in any pride were excluded due to the difficulty of assigning environmental variables see

and hepatazoon genera we developed quantitative pcr protocols using density gel gradient electrophores is to identify each protozoan species see munson et al 2008 we categorised each pathogen as likely endemic or epidemic in the lion population endemic pathogens were considered to be constantly circulating and often infecting the young while epidemic pathogens sweep through the population every few years infecting all age classes packer et al 1999 penzhorn 2006 troyer et al 2011 many of the pathogens have been previously classified as endemic or epidemic packer et al 1999 we supported our classification with ageprevalence plots fig s1 and we plotted yearly prevalence fig s2 for the pathogens not previously classified pathogens with a high prevalence at a young age  2 years old with little fluctuation across all years and age classes were considered to be likely endemic whereas an increasing ageprevalence relationship and high temporal variation were classified as more likely to be epidemic in this population feline coronavirus can have epidemic and endemic cycles and it is challenging to assess which form the individual was infected with from serological data but based on ageprevalence relationships we categorised coronavirus as an endemic infection fig s1 furthermore we used patterns of ageprevalence to infer the potential timing of infections as most individual lions were likely to be infected by the pathogens we considered endemic within the first 2 years after birth troyer et al 2011 fig s1 we assume that endemic exposure typically occurred prior to exposure by an epidemic pathogen we partitioned the endemic pathogen data into two sets based on taxonomic resolution high and medium the high taxonomic resolution dataset encompassed fivple genotype and babesia species data whereas the medium resolution dataset aggregated fivple subtype information and babesia data to genus level we examined pathogen cooccurrence patterns to evaluate preferential associations among pathogens we constructed cooccurrence networks for each taxonomic resolution as well as for pathogens tested for using qpcr and by serology in cases combining both lines of diagnostic evidence led to altered network structure to do so we first built an m  n matrix that described presencesabsences ie occurrences of both endemic and epidemic pathogens across individual lions where m was the number of individual lions and n the number of pathogens by multiplying it by its transpose we then created a summary n  n cooccurrence matrix that described for each pair of pathogens the number of observed cooccurrences across all individual lions pathogens detected infrequently in this lion population were included in this analysis to help screen for pathogens disconnected in the network the cooccurrence matrix was used to evaluate which pathogens were carried by the same individuals utilizing a modularitybased greedy approach clauset et al 2004 measures of modularity aim to determine the adequacy of different classification schemes in representing clusters and divisions in datasets here the clusters represented the cooccurrence of pathogens in individual hosts estimates of modularity were calculated for each possible classification by comparing the expected fraction of pathogen cooccurrence to random cooccurrences newman 2006 the classification with the highest modularity from all the generated classifications was selected we then computed a measure of network structure  and modularity index based on node overlap and

confounding variables below as fixed effects individual sampled prideyear ie which pride and year the individual was sampled in and yearlandscape ie what year was the individual sampled in the serengeti sampled were added as random effects as pathogen traits may shape the distribution of each pathogen eg similar environmental and host variables may shape tickborne pathogens we included traits such as pathogen type see table 1 in each analysis we utilised the default priors described in full detail in ovaskainen et al 2017 and ran the hmsc model twice using 3 million mcmc samples the first 300 000 of which being burnin each run was carried out using a different seed visual inspection of mcmc traces and the gelmanrubin diagnostic calculated to assess convergence in addition we made sure that the effective sample size ess of each parameter was  200 as part of the slp most of the individuals in this study have been regularly observed since birth mosser  packer 2009 we selected 13 predictor variables that we thought were likely to be important for pathogen exposure and thus could confound possible associations patterns table 2 we included variables that captured individual variability eg age at sampling and pride characteristics including environmental variables eg average vegetation cover of the prides territory see table 2 for measurement details the high taxonomic resolution summary network indicated a significantly nested architecture   074 with relatively low modularity modularity index  0393 z  3307 p  0001 with three clusters fig 1a the largest cluster green nodes included all of the protozoans epidemic pathogens and some fivple genotypes whereas the remaining two clusters consisted of fivple genotypes fig 1a when we modelled networks based on diagnostic test the general pattern did not substantially change with the exception that rvf clustered separately from the other viruses detected using serology in both network formulations phylogenetically similar genotypes of fiv did not cluster together fountainjones et al 2017 see fig s5 in contrast the medium resolution network was completely nested with no modularity   1 modularity index  0 z   p  0 and no significant clusters fig 1b after accounting for environmental individual and pride factors and scale the jsdm analysis identified strong associations between pathogens fig 2 that were not detected in the summary cooccurrence network including individual prideyear and landscapeyear scales in our cooccurrence models was important as our ability to detect associations varied at an individual and prideyear level we detected strong associations between a small subset of epidemic and endemic pathogens fivple b and hepatozoon felis were negatively associated with rvf fig 2 and fivple b was also negatively associated with parvovirus fig 2a and fig s6a however these associations could only be detected at medium taxonomic resolution in contrast at high taxonomic resolution we identified positive associations between b gibsoni and rvf that were not detected at mediumresolution the strongest associations between endemic and epidemic pathogens were detected at the lowest spatialtemporal resolution landscapeyear in the high taxonomic resolution model pathogens separated into two groups with each group having a very similar association profile one group was characterised by positive associations between the babesia species fivple c2 cdv and parvovirus the other group was characterised by positive associations between two fivple genotypes c1  b2 coronavirus h felis and calicivirus figs 2c and fig s6c there were strong negative associations between pathogens in each separate group eg cdv and fivple c1 generally the same associations held in the medium taxonomic resolution models fig 2c and fig s6c but there were exceptions for example fivple c1 and c2 had opposing association profiles but as fivple c1 had a higher prevalence fig s7 c1 had the same overall association profile as fivple c associations between epidemic pathogens were rare at the yearlevel we detected positive associations between cdv and parvovirus with both pathogens negatively associated with calicivirus fig 2c and fig s6c in contrast associations between the endemic pathogens were common but the nature of the associations also differed at each taxonomic scale for example in the medium resolution model we detected a positive association between h felis and fivple c not found in the highresolution model indicating that fivple subtype but not genotype was important for this association fig 2b and fig s6b strikingly we found that fivple subtypes had contrasting association profiles at the individual level fivple b and c were negatively associated with each other and fivple c was positively associated with coronavirus whereas fivple b was negatively associated with coronavirus fig 2a and fig s6a both high and medium taxonomic resolution jsdms had reasonable explanatory power tjur r
2  0381  0330 respectively in both models the landscape and host factors that explained the distribution of each pathogen were not predicted well by pathogen traits fig s8 see fig 3 for a summary of all of the associations detected across scales from our crosssectional data and figs s9s10 for model details here we demonstrate nonrandom associations in the pathogens infecting wild african lions with both negative and positive associations detected between endemic and epidemic pathogens while there was minimal structure in the cooccurrence network fig 1a we uncovered structure after accounting for scale and controlling for potentially confounding environmental and host variables fig 2 using ageprevalence relationships we could assess the likely order of infection using crosssectional data we found that the particular endemic pathogen an individual is infected by as a cub may have consequences for which novel epidemic pathogen the individual is infected with later in life fig 3 we emphasise that the approach used here can start to untangle pathogen infracommunity relationships and identify potential endemicepidemic associations in wild populations these can then be compared with knowledge of pathogen pathogenesis and validated invitro in a laboratory setting while clinical or laboratory studies of coinfection in lions are rare for good reason the associations we found have clear precedence in similar pathogens coinfecting humans and represent plausible interactions our results not only provide new insights on pathogen community structure in the serengeti lions but also provide a valuable framework for exploring pathogen cooccurrence networks and infracommunity dynamics cooccurrence networks were highly nested with relatively low modularity particularly at a medium taxonomic resolution nonetheless rvf did cluster separately from the other pathogens tested via serology which potentially indicates that rvf unlike the other epidemic viruses has a distinct epidemic cycle with most of the interacting partners being more chronic pathogens this is supported by the rvf association profile detected in our jsdm analysis and is intuitive given that rvf is the only mosquitoborne pathogen that we sampled even though we sampled pathogens considered important for lion health we lacked data on other potentially pathogenic bacteria helminths and fungi that the lions were exposed to or potentially infected by furthermore symbiont interactions can also be important in shaping pathogen dynamics eg halliday et al 2017 and could be considered in pathogen infracommunity studies these additional taxa may lead to further segregation in the network as larger and more diverse networks typically show increased modularity and segregation thebault  fontaine 2010 sauve et al 2014 expanding sampling to construct a more complete microbe and macroparasite network would also capture a broader array of potentially facilitative and competitive associations ezenwa 2016 aivelo  norberg 2018 after accounting for environment host and scale we found that the endemic pathogens were strongly associated with the epidemic pathogens and based on mammalian laboratorybased experiments suggest that these patterns represent plausible interactions between pathogens for example we detected negative associations between endemic pathogens fivple b and h felis and rvf after accounting for differences between individuals coinfections between bunyaviruses like rvf and retroviruses are likely common in humans and wildlife though there are surprisingly few studies addressing the topic in contrast relationships between dengue virus a flavivirus and hiv are relatively well understood flaviviruses and hiv share similar immune receptors that can inhibit hiv replication and the molecular machinery used to do so may be a viable way to control hiv infection eg xiang et al 2009 given the overall structural similarity of flaviviruses and bunyaviruses hernandez et al2014 it is possible that a similar mechanism underlies the association in lions between rvf and fivple that we observed although we show that this association was subtype specific if this was true rvf might inhibit fivple b infection  counter to our assumption that endemic pathogens in our system infected each individual first fig 3 the greatest number of associations between epidemic and endemic pathogens were detected when we included differences across years yearlandscape scale in our analysis these associations could represent plausible facilitative or competitive interactions cdv and babesia are wellknown to interact with high levels of babesia infection magnifying the impacts of consequent tcell depletion caused by cdv infection leading to mortality of nearly 40 of the lion population in 1994 munson et al 2008 we found that all tickborne haemoparasites showed positive associations with cdv including b leo with insert despite its low prevalence in 19931994 fig s9 parvovirus was also positively associated with cdv but this was likely due to similarities in timings of epidemics with a parvovirus epidemic in 1992 just before the 1994 cdv epidemic packer et al 1999 parvoviruses are also immune suppressive and so the timing of the parvovirus outbreak may also have contributed to the cdvbabesiainduced mortality the general negative relationship between fivple c and cdvbabesia supports the theory that individuals infected by subtype c were more likely to die in the consequent babesiacdv outbreak troyer et al 2011 thus this negative association may not be due to competition between pathogens but rather to mortality our approach detected strong associations between the endemic pathogens also for example there were opposing associations between the fivple subtypes and coronavirus fig 2 negative associations between retroviruses and coronaviruses are rarely reported yet there are plausible molecular pathways hiv1 and human coronaviruses hcov share remarkably similar binding receptors chan et al 2006 and some mild hcov strains are even considered a viable vaccine against hiv eriksson et al 2006 this may explain the negative association we detected for fivple b and coronavirus but does not explain the positive association between fivple c and coronavirus we detected across scales the mechanism driving fivple subtype specific relationships with coronaviruses remain unclear and as coronaviruses infecting lions are also likely to be genetically diverse examining the genetic structure of coronavirus may help untangle these associations further in contrast competitive associations between hiv strains are well characterised with hiv1 found to outcompete hiv2 for blood resources arin et al 2005 for fivple even though coinfection is relatively common troyer et al 2011 competition between subtypes could be important as there is anecdotal cell culture evidence that fivple b can propagate more rapidly than fivple c m roelke unpublished data there were also contrasting associations between the protozoan species for example the distribution of b felis was not shaped by any other protozoan and in general had a narrow association profile fig 2 unlike the other babesia species for the individuals coinfected by protozoans associations involving b felis were also common whereas coinfections involving h felis and the other babesia species varied in prevalence and composition fig s9 even though b gibsoni and b felis show similar age prevalence profiles fig s1 the prevalence of b felis over time was relatively stable compared to the other protozoa fig s10 differences in the host range for individual babesia species and potential host differences in virulence may partially explain these patterns for example b felis has only ever been detected in felids whereas b gibsoni has a much broader host range including canids penzhorn 2006 generalist pathogens may have greater pathogenicity as there can be reduced selective restraint on virulence particularly in dead end hosts woolhouse et al 2001 if more pathogenic species are more likely to interact with other pathogens compared to less virulent pathogens is an open question in disease ecology importantly patterns like these would be missed without incorporating highresolution pathogen data there are however limitations to this approach the inability to distinguish mortality or correlated exposure ie an individual is infected by multiple pathogens in the same transmission event from negative or positive associations is one of them and careful interpretation of associations is necessary incorporating approaches such as structural equation models that explicitly include potential mechanisms that underlie candidate pathogen associations carver et al 2015 could be a valuable additional step in future pathogen network studies another weakness is the inability to estimate the timing of these infections more precisely for example the negative association between rvf and h felis could be due to temporal differences when ticks and mosquitoes emerge after rains years with higher rainfall increase mosquito abundance thus increasing rvf prevalence fig s2 whereas ticks emerge en masse when rains follow a dry period potentially increasing h felis prevalence munson et al 2008 as rainfall was calibrated to the year of sampling rather than the age of infection which could differ the jsdm approach could not capture this variation studies using longitudinal data to quantify associations using a similar framework to ours eg telfer et al 2010 henrichs et al 2016 will be beneficial as they are likely to provide more robust estimates of the order of infection in wild populations furthermore we cannot quantify the importance of these associations in shaping pathogen distribution across scales compared to processes such as host density lastly incorporating immune function and host resources in both the summary network and jsdm analyses are likely to provide mechanistic insight into pathogen network structure griffiths et al 2014 higher resolution pathogen traits such as duration of infection are likely to provide further mechanistic insight into how and why pathogens cooccur as they do in freeliving communities ulrich et al 2017 however given the daunting complexity of pathogen infracommunity dynamics our twostep approach can assess broad network structure and identify useful candidate interactions between pathogens thereby reducing some of this complexity the high frequency of cooccurrence and coinfection in lions  and the potential for specific associations to cause population decline  highlights the importance of understanding pathogen associations the lion pathogen cooccurrence network was highly connected with both positive and negative associations between endemic and epidemic pathogens our findings indicate that the lion pathogen infracommunity is influenced by a number of ecological factors and associations between pathogens we identify useful associations between pathogens thereby reducing some of this complexity more broadly our work demonstrates how different network approaches can be combined to gain insights into the ecological factors underlying pathogen associations and how this can be applied to the study of pathogen communities in wildlife populations in addition to these biological insights the study highlights several critical areas for methodological improvement that can currently limit robust inference of pathogen associations from crosssectional serological and qpcr data addressing these limitations is timely given the ongoing threat of wildlife population decline creating a need to integrate better molecular ecological and

encroachment on the territories of giant panda diseases are probably the greatest threats although effective measures have been carried out to protect giant panda in breeding and reproduction prevention and control of infectious diseases especially virus diseases it is still an arduous and pressing task recently canine distemper virus canine coronavirus canine adenovirus minute virus parainfluenza virus have been detected in giant panda tennant et al 1993 he et al 2000 gao et al 2003 qiao et al 2004 in china xia and he had separated canine distemper virus and coronavirus from liver of giant panda respectively therefore it is very important to study the immune system of giant panda especially immune function genes so we have cloned the genes coding for the ifn- and expressed them in eukaryotic cells and tested their biological activities which could be attributable to enhance the survival ability of giant panda

water and the blots were dried with paper towels and stored away from light at room temperature supernatants collected from transfected 293 cells were treated at ph 2 for 24 h at 4 c or for 1 h at 65 c respectively antiviral activities were compared between treated and untreated samples the antiviral activity of amifn- was determined in vitro by utilizing a standard vsv assay as previously described with minor changes vogel et al 1991 wonderling et al 2002 the antiviral activity of amifn- was assayed in a cytopathic effect reduction assay using mdbk cells challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus vsv in 96-well microtiter plates briefly mdbk cells were seeded into 96-well plate in a concentration of 5  104 cellsml after 24 h serial dilutions containing ifn- supernatants were added to 96-well plates and each sample had three replicates after cells were incubated for 24 h the supernatants were removed and the cells were infected with vsv at 4  104 plaque forming unit pfuml after 24 h cells were washed three times with pbs and stained with methyl violet solution the cells were then washed with deionized water and allowed to dry the methyl violet was eluted with 100 ml of methanol and absorbance was measured at 570 nm on a microplate reader 3550 bio-rad usa the activity of giant panda interferon- was shown as the reciprocal of the dilution leading to 50 cytopathic effect the supernatants of pcdna31  and purified human ifn-2b zhongshan china were as negative control and positive control respectively these activities were normalized to the activity calculated for amifn-6 in the same experiment and corrected for the quantification of the amount of ifn measured in the supernatants the antiproliferative activity of amifn- was determined as previously described van pesch et al 2004 with minor changes b16 melanoma and k562 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1000 cellswell respectively after 24 h serial dilutions of the ifn-containing supernatants 100 l were added to the cells after incubation for 72 h the cell density were quantified by using the wst-1 cell proliferation reagent biorot nanjing china briefly 10 l of wst-1 10 mgml were added per well and incubated for 2 h at 37 c absorbance was read at 450 nm the activity of amifn- was shown as the reciprocal of the dilution leading to 50 inhibition of cell proliferation the supernatants of pcdna31  and purified human ifn-2b zhongshan china were as negative control and positive control respectively for each independent experiment the assay was performed three times activity is expressed relative to that of ifn-6 and corrected for the quantification of the amount of ifn measured in the supernatants the genbank accession numbers for amifn- nucleotide sequences are as follows dq392967 amifn-1 dq392968 amifn-2 dq392970 amifn-3 dq392969 amifn-4 dq392972 amifn-5 dq392971 amifn-6 dq392974 amifn-7 dq392973 amifn-8 dq392975 amifn-9 dq392976 amifn-10 dq392977 amifn-11 dq392978 amifn-12 and dq392978 amifn- pseudogene the genes encoding amifn- subtypes were cloned by pcr from giant panda dna the primers for amifn- were designed based on the conserved regions of carnivora ifn- genes pcr products were cloned into a ta cloning vector and the cloned fragments were sequenced dna sequence analyses indicated that there were 12 subtypes of amifn- genes and one ifn- pseudogene termed amifn-1amifn-12 and amifn- pseudogene respectively the amifn- pseudogene had changes in nucleotides at 23 and 74 which leads to a stop codon at amino acid position 24 comparison of the amfn- subtype sequences demonstrated that homologies of nucleotides and amino acids approximate were 9499 and 9099 respectively fig 1
and table 1
 all deduced amifn- sequences contained an n-terminal secretory signal sequence from residue 123 and a putative n-glycosylation site at position 102104 the predicted length of the mature polypeptides contained either 165 amifn-1amifn-11 or 166 amifn-12 amino acid residues amifn-12 contained one more amino acid residue at position 54 lys the predicted molecular mass of the protein with signal peptide was 20 kda each of the deduced mature sequences contained six cysteine residues the cysteine residues at positions 1 29 99 and 137 were very similar to the highly conserved cysteines in other mammalian ifn- proteins at positions 1 29 99 and 139 roberts et al 1997 suggesting a common tertiary structure five proline residues were conserved among all of the giant panda ifn- sequences at the positions of 4 25 39 111 and 142 which correspond to the conserved positions of 4 26 39 110 and 139 in other mammalian ifn- protein roberts et al 1997 comparison of the amifn- gene sequences to feline ifn- sequences demonstrated homologies of approximately 72 respectively comparison of the amino acid sequences of all giant panda subtypes with huifn-2 j00207 and huifn-1 m11003 showed approximate homologies of 5659 and 5860 respectively fig 2
 homologies of the dog ifn-6 np001007129 and mouse ifn-7 np032360 amino acid sequences compared with the giant panda subtypes were approximately 6771 and 4953 respectively to better determine the evolutionary position of amifn- a phylogenetic tree was constructed all amifn- genes clustered in the same group fig 3
 amifn- clustered with interferon from other mammalian such as cat and dog interferon originating an in-group with respect to other mammalian species the coding sequence of each amifn- was sub-cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector pcdna31  the recombinant plasmids and pcdna31 vector were used to transfect into hek293 cells supernatants obtained from amifn- transiently transfected 293 cells were concentrated 10-fold using acetone recombinant protein was visualized on sds-page by silver staining western blotting analysis of the supernatants using monoclonal antibody against huifn- indicated that all 12 subtypes of amifn- genes were expressed and secreted fig 4
 the relative amounts of the different ifn subtypes in the supernatants were quantified by phosphorimager after sds-page the antiviral activities of these supernatants were determined against vsv the measured antiviral activities were then corrected for the amount of ifn to calculate the relative antiviral activities of the various ifn subtypes no measurable activity could be detected in the supernatants from cells transfected with the vector alone all ifn- subtypes displayed antiviral activities but different ones had various antiviral activities fig 5
 for example amifn-3 amifn-4 and amifn-8 showed the highest antiviral potencies four-fold activity levels compared to amifn-6 whereas amifn-2 amifn-5 amifn-7 and amifn-11 displayed lower activity than amifn-6 we tested the stability of 12 subtypes of amifn- at ph 2 and 65 c respectively therefore the supernatants containing ifn- were treated at ph 2 or 65 c and then used in the antiviral assay in parallel with untreated supernatants the results showed that all amifn- were stable at ph 2 for 24 h or 65 c for 1 h because no loss in antiviral activity was detected in treated and untreated samples data not shown to determine whether some of the amifn- subtypes evolved to acquire distinct biological functions the relative antiproliferative activities of the different amifn- subtypes were also determined by assaying the growth inhibition of b16 murine melanoma cells and k562 cells results presented in fig 6 fig 7
show the antiproliferative potencies of the different subtypes to b16 murine melanoma cells fig 6 amifn-3 amifn-4 and amifn-8 showed the highest antiproliferative potencies 32-fold activity higher than amifn-6 whereas amifn-5 amifn-7 and amifn-10 showed 16-fold activity higher than amifn-6 amifn-9 and amifn-11 displayed the same activity as amifn-6 to k562 cells fig 7 amifn-3 amifn-7 and amifn-10 showed the highest antiproliferative potencies 32-fold activity higher than amifn-6 whereas amifn-4 amifn-5 and amifn-8 showed 16-fold activity higher than amifn-6 amifn-11 displayed the same activity as amifn-6 in this report we describe the cloning of genes encoding 12 giant panda type i ifn proteins to confirm that sequences existed in the giant panda were not generated during either the pcr amplification or sequencing process or both two independent pcrs and sequencing were conducted these clones were sequenced bidirectionally at least twice and the consistent results from more than two positive clones were regarded as one subtype all amifn- genes are intronless similar to other mammalian type i ifn subtypes wonderling et al 2002 nagai et al 2004 nakamura et al 1992 the differences among 12 giant panda ifn- protein sequences are based on a small number of amino acid changes the differences observed among the amifn- products are the length of the proteins which has been reported for other species such as the mouse pig and horse but not for human ifn- which has the same size in different subtypes this size variation where described has been related to deletions or insertions in the nucleotide sequence multiple ifn- genes have been detected in many species velan et al 1985 harrison et al 2004 henco et al 1985 goeddel et al 1981 chaplin et al 1996 it was found that giant panda ifn- has 12 subtypes the woodchuck ifn- proteins are encoded by a multigenic family composed of at least 10 subtypes berraondo et al 2002 the reason for this redundancy remains unknown type i ifns compete for common binding sites on human cells meager 1998 and are believed to share a common receptor kunzi and rowe 2001 however it seems that the different ifn- subtypes although sharing some activities have different functional profiles within the ifn- subfamily genes are clustered by species suggesting the possibility that ifn- genes have been duplicated independently in the case of ifn- there is evidence that the ifn subfamily may have diversified adaptively in mammals existence of so many ifn- subtypes raises the question regarding whether there are biological differences among these proteins although ifn- subtype proteins from the same species are extremely homologous differences in biological potency are often observed ortaldo et al 1984 mouchel-vielh et al 1992 foster et al 1996 yeow et al 1998 baldwin et al 2004 different subtypes of huifn- reveal various antiviral activities huifn-8 was reportedly the most potent while huifn-1 provided the least amount of antiviral activity foster et al 1996 several authors have reported that muifn-4 was 510 times more active than muifn-1 van heuvel et al 1986 van heuvel et al 1988 to compare the properties of the different amifn- subtypes the recombinant plasmids expressing the various ifn- subtypes were transiently transfected in 293 cells in parallel with the vector pcdna31 supernatants from transfected 293 cells were collected and analyzed we demonstrated antiviral and antiproliferative activities of all amifn- subtypes and observed that different subtypes had different activities as reported for human ifn- subtypes the differences in activities might be concerned with differences in receptor binding affinities aguet et al 1984 meister et al 1986 piehler and schreiber 1999 yamaoka et al 1999 maybe subtle modification in the protein structure accounts for the variation in biological activities as the activity of mouse ifn- van pesch et al 2004 our results showed a good correlation between the antiviral and antiproliferative potencies of the ifn subtypes in conclusion this is the first report of the cloning and characterization of the giant panda ifn- family with facilitates the way for systematic studies of the biological and therapeutic effects of this cytokine amifn- is likely to be efficient against both chronic viral infections and neoplastic diseases that affect the giant panda population it will be significant importance for further studies to protect this endangered species  evaluation of the activity of influenza and influenza-like

 canine coronavirus is one of the major pathogenic agents of gastroenteritis and diarrhea in dogs the main purpose of the study was to identify the frequency of ccov infections in dogs with diarrhea and to characterize the strains that circulate in greece by means of molecular techniques ccov was detected in 651 of the dogs presenting diarrhea the frequency of ccov detection was higher than the frequency reported in other countries including italy turkey england japan and portugal bandai et al 1999 decaro et al 2010 yesilbag et al 2004 highlighting the significance of the pathogen as a contributing agent to the manifestation of diarrhea in dogs in addition positive samples were identified in all regions sampled suggesting that the virus is frequently detected and it circulates among canine population in greece according to the results of the present study ccov was more frequently detected in dogs housed in groups than in singly housed animals one possible explanation of the difference is the close contact of the animals the fecal-oral transmission of the disease and the long-term viral shedding as it has been suggested dogs may be contagious for a period varying from 2 weeks to several months keenan et al 1976 pratelli et al 2001a pratelli et al 2001b highly contaminating their environment likewise similar differences between singly and group housed dogs have been identified in previous studies by means of serological assays naylor et al 2001 rimmelzwaan et al 1991 dogs of all breeds and ages appear to be susceptible to ccov infection appel 1987 carmichael and binn 1981 in the present study ccov was more frequently detected in dogs younger than 3 months old than in dogs of at least 3 months of age puppies usually become susceptible after the decline of the maternally derived antibodies which last for a period of 45 weeks appel 1987 in contrast older animals appear to be less susceptible due to acquired immunity occurring as a result of prior exposure to the pathogen in the present study the oldest animal tested positive was a 12 year old dog the results indicate that ccov is more widespread in puppies though older animals can also be presented with a coronaviral infection concerning the detection and characterization of ccov both rt-pcr and real time rt-pcr were used it was shown that there were strains either detected 4206 or characterized 8134 ccov-i 7134 ccov-ii only by real time rt-pcr as it was expected since these assays have higher sensitivity compared to the rt-pcr assays decaro et al 2004 decaro et al 2005 however in the present study some of the strains were either detected 2206 or characterized 2134 ccov-i 7134 ccov-ii only by rt-pcr assays which may be explained by the fact that the assays amplify different parts of the genome since coronavirus mutation rates are considered to be high due to the infidelity of rna-dependent rna polymerase woo et al 2009 false-negative results are expected when either primers or probes lack the ability to anneal it is obvious that the results may be more reliable by using both assays since no assay has been demonstrated to represent the gold standard for the identification and characterization of ccov regarding genotypesubtype identification it was shown that ccov-i was more frequently detected than classical ccov-iia or ccov-iib viruses however in most of the positive samples 4701 more than one strain was detected in addition in the present study triple ccov infections ccov-iiiaiib representing almost 5 of the mixed infections were detected for the first time since so far only double infections have been identified in all possible combinations decaro et al 2009 decaro et al 2010 erles and brownlie 2009 mixed ccov infections are usual although their significance is not completely understood pratelli et al 2004 preliminary studies have indicated that they may be related to more severe symptoms decaro et al 2005 but the inability to cultivate ccov-i so far impedes the elucidation of its pathogenesis and its role in mixed infections in the present study the 5 end of the s gene was chosen for sequence and phylogenetic analysis of ccov strains since mutations that are related to antigenicity virulence and viral tropism are often observed in this region lai and holmes 2001 sanchez et al 1999 regarding ccov-i the greek strains showed low genetic similarity to each other and to the prototype ccov-i strains most of the ccov-i greek strains shared the highest similarity with 2303 prototype strain while only two with elmo02 revealing that 2303-like strains are more frequently detected in greece in addition the two different ccov-i strains detected in the same pet shop outbreak at0209igr and at0509igr indicate that different strains of the same genotypesubtype can be involved in an outbreak regarding ccov-iia the greek strains showed high genetic similarity to each other and to the prototype cb05 with the exception of one strain ed9908iiagr ccov-iia strains shared much higher identity to each other and to the prototype strains than ccov-i strains recently it was suggested that ccov-i represents a possible parental biotype of ccov-iia lorusso et al 2008 if this is the case the genome of ccov-iia is being subjected to the evolutionary pressure of the host immune system for a shorter period of time with respect to the ccov-i genome this fact makes tempting to assume that the higher homogeneity of the ccov-iia strains genome may be attributed to the shorter circulation time with respect to strains of type i sequence analysis of more ccov-i strains coming from different geographic regions may help acquire more information regarding their variability since so far only few ccov-i strains have been analyzed of significant interest is the ed9908iiagr strain that appears to be divergent indicating the plasticity of the 5-end of the ccov s gene the receptor-binding domain of coronaviruses is localized within the n-terminus of the s protein and it has been shown that amino acid changes in the region are associated with changes in the tropism and virulence of the virus lai and holmes 2001 sanchez et al 1999 similar divergent strains have been identified in the past in australia and in the united kingdom and they have been associated with severe gastroenteritis outbreaks naylor et al 2002 sanchez-morgado et al 2004 isolation and experimental infection could give information regarding ed9908iiagr mutations and their possible relation to viral pathogenicity regarding ccov-iib it was shown that the newly emerged strains circulate in greece with higher frequency than previously reported decaro et al 2010 sequence and phylogenetic analysis of ccov-iib strains revealed for the first time that the greek viruses belong to the newly emerged tgev-like strains and not to the old ucd1 tgev-like strain in addition the greek strains shared high similarity to each other and were genetically related to strains from hungary and romania and distant from uk strains the relation among strains could be explained based on the trends in commercial trade practices since greece as italy decaro et al 2010 imports dogs mainly from countries of eastern europe from the results of this study it can be concluded that ccov infection is widespread in greece especially in young puppies and dogs housed in groups presenting with diarrhea mixed infections prevail among ccov infections with the triple ccov-iiiaiib infections being reported for the first time sequence analysis of different strains revealed high variability among ccov-i strains at the 5 end of the s gene in addition the identification of a divergent strain is reported the circulation of ccov-i highly variable and tgev-like emerging strains as well as the detection of divergent strains raise significant concerns over the spread of the strains in dogs to date vaccination against ccov is considered a controversial issue depending heavily upon the population at risk further research on the pathogenicity could inform on the possible need for wider cross-reactive prophylactic vaccines  multicenter evaluation of the eplex respiratory pathogen panel for the detection of viral and bacterial respiratory tract pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs n babady esther matthew england r kristen jurcic smith l taojun he dona

global burden of respiratory tract illnesses with up to 4 million deaths worldwide in 2013 1 several pathogens including viruses and bacteria can cause respiratory tract infections as clinical presentations often overlap identification of the underlying pathogen based solely on clinical criteria is challenging 2 even though most respiratory tract infections are self-limited in immunocompetent hosts many are treated as shown in a recent study highlighting the increase in unnecessary antibiotic use in this group 3 in other patient groups including immunocompromised patients elderly patients and critically ill patients complications from respiratory tract infections often occur with poor outcomes including increased morbidity and mortality 46 thus the ability to rapidly and accurately diagnose respiratory tract infections is critical for optimal patient care additionally rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential for the timely administration of antiviral therapy when available and the institution of contact and droplet precautions to prevent health care-associated transmission 7 8 several instruments and multiplexed molecular panels are currently approved by the us food and drug administration fda for the rapid and sensitive detection of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal swab nps specimens these methods differ based on several criteria including the degree of multiplexing 4 to 22 targets complexity of the method moderate to high throughput low to high and turnaround time tat 1 h to 8 h 9 in general performance characteristics of these multiplex panels are significantly better than those of conventional methods including viral culture and antigen tests and have replaced these methods in many laboratories on the other hand the increased cost of multiplexed molecular panels compared to the cost of conventional methods has raised questions on their costbenefit ratio particularly as many viral targets on these panels have no specific treatments however given their utility in the rapid diagnosis of infections especially in immunocompromised patients infection control and prevention practices and antibiotic stewardship the interest in multiplexed pcrs remains high the genmark respiratory pathogen rp panel is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex test that recently received us fda clearance for use on genmarks new eplex instrument the eplex rp panel detects 21 of the most common respiratory pathogens in nps specimens viral targets identified are adenovirus coronavirus 229e hku1 nl63 and oc43

piv3 piv4 respiratory syncytial virus subtype a rsv-a and rsv-b bacterial targets identified are chlamydia pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae 10 the eplex rp panel is a sample-to-answer multiplex assay that runs on a single-use cartridge that automates all aspects of nucleic acid testing including extraction amplification and detection it combines electrowetting microfluidics and genmarks esensor technology which is based on the principles of competitive dna hybridization and electrochemical detection as previously described for the genmark xt-8 respiratory viral panel 11 in this multicenter clinical trial study the performance characteristics of the investigational-use-only iuo eplex rp panel were evaluated by using nps specimens collected at 13 sites across the united states and canada reproducibility was evaluated at 3 sites in addition to assay performance other characteristics including assay workflow and turnaround time were evaluated the study population included patients of all ages and both genders presenting with signs andor symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection at 13 clinical sites located in the united states and canada residual nps specimens were prospectively collected from march 2013 through august 2014 from 5 sites and frozen at 80c for future testing and were prospectively collected from september through october 2016 from 4 sites and tested fresh to supplement the results of the prospective collection nps samples positive for low-prevalence pathogens were retrospectively collected and frozen frozen samples were thawed pipetted

targets with comparator methods are provided in tables 2 to 4 separately for retrospectively collected samples and prospectively collected samples and with all samples combined additional data for fresh and frozen prospectively collected samples are presented in table s3 in the supplemental material the overall percent agreement between the eplex rp and biofire rp results was 95 for all targets tested the ppa ranged from 851 95 ci 802 to 889 for coronaviruses to 951 95 ci 890 to 979 for influenza a 2009 h1n1 virus with npas of 995 95 ci 991 to 997 and 998 95 ci 995 to 999 respectively table 4 for 6 samples eplex rp was negative for the influenza a virus target but positive for either the 2009 h1 n  5 or h3 n  1 subtype and 9 samples were positive for the influenza a virus target without a subtype being identified of note influenza a h1 virus was not detected and very few chlamydia pneumoniae n  4 isolates were detected during the study period for these targets at least 50 specimens with the pathogen spiked into negative nps specimens were contrived all were detected by eplex rp data not shown discordance resolution results table 5 demonstrate that while eplex rp had a high level of agreement with the biofire rp and detected the same targets in nearly all samples each assay detected targets that the other did not in table 5 samples with targets that were detected by eplex rp but not detected by biofire rp fp are counted as true-positive samples if the target was detected by discordance testing tpd samples with targets not detected by eplex rp but detected by the biofire rp fn are counted as true-negative samples if the target was not detected by discordance testing tnd given the number of discordant samples between the two panels for coronavirus detection additional repeat testing by both the biofire rp and eplex rp was performed as part of the discordance analysis this additional testing demonstrated evidence of decreased sample stability over time or variability in aliquots tested thus for coronaviruses a fn sample was counted as a true-positive sample if the target was detected by repeat testing by eplex rp tpd a total of 26 samples were not tested by pcr assays for a variety of reasons including an insufficient volume for repeat testing which included 8 samples with fn results 1 for coronavirus 1 for hmpv 4 for hrvev and 2 for influenza

technologistsoperators or sites data not shown the time to identification from receipt to result was determined to be 1 h 45 min and 57 s with hands-on times hots per sample of 1 min and 35 s in this multicenter clinical study the performance characteristics of the new eplex respiratory pathogen panel on the genmark eplex instrument were estimated by measuring agreement with the results of the biofire rp a commercially available multiplex respiratory panel the eplex rp panel was recently fda cleared and expands the available options for laboratories interested in the rapid diagnosis of respiratory tract infections using broadly multiplexed molecular assay on nps specimens similar to the biofire rp eplex rp offers a large panel of both viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in a simple sample-to-answer format with minimal hands-on time and a rapid turnaround time to results as with all molecular diagnostic test methods both the biofire rp and eplex rp have the potential to generate false-positive and false-negative results as confirmed in this study by additional testing with target-specific pcrs with bidirectional sequencing the unavailability of an established gold standard prevents a true measure of correctness requiring the use of agreement measures with a nonreference standard instead to establish the performance characteristics of a new test 13 thus data presented in this study reflect only the agreement between the results of the two platforms in spite of these limitations the overall performance of eplex rp was comparable to that of the biofire rp with an overall percent agreement true-positive and true-negative results of 95 for all available targets tested in line with our results a recent study by nijhuis and colleagues evaluating the performance of the eplex research-use-only ruo rp panel compared to laboratory-developed assays found an overall agreement of 974 with discordant results occurring primarily for samples with low pathogen loads as estimated by using cycle threshold ct values ie high ct value 35 10 the highest numbers of discordant results were observed for adenovirus coronavirus and rhinovirusenterovirus targets this finding may be explained by the large diversity of genotypes present within each of these groups of pathogens or the prevalence of these pathogens in the population tested for adenovirus the performance of diagnostic tests is particularly important for young children and immunocompromised hosts however the detection of adenovirus can be challenging in this study eplex rp detected more adenoviruses than did the biofire rp a recent report on the performance of biofire rp v17 for the detection of adenovirus highlighted the decreased sensitivity of the assay for samples with low viral loads or those positive for species a d and f 14 although the eplex rp panel detects 4 genotypes of coronaviruses hku1 oc43 229e and nl63 results are reported without the genotyping information there are currently no treatments for coronaviruses and the utility of the genotyping information may lie in its value for epidemiological studies reports of severe coronavirus infections have been reported for immunocompromised hosts but there has not been any indication that severity is associated with a particular genotype 15 similar to the biofire rp eplex rp detects a wide range of rhinovirus and enteroviruses genotypes but given their high degree of genetic similarity it does not reliably differentiate between these two species based on discordance analysis performed by pcr and bidirectional sequencing most samples were positive for rhinovirus a trend that is expected given that rhinoviruses are the most common cause of the common cold 16 the overall agreement for influenza viruses was high as the prospective collection periods for this clinical study occurred during the 2013 and 2016 respiratory seasons there was an expected lack of clinical specimens positive for influenza a h1 virus 17 most of the influenza virus infections during that time period were due to the 2009 h1 and h3 viruses hence the evaluation of the influenza virus a h1 target was performed entirely by using contrived nps samples similar to the biofire rp results instances of samples positive for influenza a virus without subtypes or positive for an influenza a virus subtype only were identified such results may be caused by low virus titers or a novel influenza virus subtype and thus require additional testing only a limited number of samples were positive for chlamydia pneumoniae and the evaluation was conducted primarily with contrived samples the performance for c pneumoniae was similar to that reported in the biofire rp clinical study which was also conducted by using primarily contrived samples 12 both chlamydia pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae are associated with atypical community-acquired pneumonia cap with no seasonality and nonspecific symptoms 18 therefore the inclusion of both bacteria in large multiplex panels has the potential to significantly improve the diagnosis of cap a notable difference between the eplex rp panel and the biofire rp is the absence of bordetella pertussis-bordetella parapertussis targets among the bacterial targets it is noteworthy that unlike other bacterial targets on the panel infection with bordetella
pertussis-b parapertussis has a relatively specific epidemiology with higher incidences typically being reported for children less than 2 months old and more recently for unvaccinated populations or vaccinated patients with waning immunity 19 thus exclusion from a highly multiplexed respiratory panel may be warranted in addition the utilization of the single-copy pertussis toxin promoter target ptxp in some multiplex panels has been shown to be less sensitive for the detection of b pertussis than pcr tests targeted to the multicopy is481 insertion sequence 20 as a result when b pertussis infection is suspected an fda-cleared b pertussis molecular test may be more appropriate similar to other broadly multiplexed respiratory panels the eplex rp panel allows the detection of coinfections in this study coinfections were identified in 55 of samples with human rhinovirusenterovirus being the most common virus detected in coinfected specimens the importance of detecting coinfections was highlighted in a recent study showing that viral-bacterial coinfection during severe cap in adults resulted in a more complicated disease course and was associated with complications 21 in other studies human rhinoviruses were frequently detected in association with bacterial pathogens in a hematopoietic stem cell transplant population suggesting that this commonly detected virus may be a significant cause of severe pneumonia in immunocompromised patients 22 23 the initial rate of invalid results with eplex rp was 48 with repeat testing resulting in a final rate of invalid results of 02 this value falls in the range of rates of invalid results reported for other multiplexed respiratory panels including nanosphere verigene rv 97 xtag rvp 1 to 2 and the biofire rp 1 to 3 2427 the eplex instrument consists of a stand-alone system with no additional accessories eg computer and a touch screen making it a great option for space-constrained laboratories the eplex instrument is available in configurations ranging from one to four towers with each tower containing six random-access testing bays this supports single-shift 8 h testing volumes ranging from 24 samples to 96 samples with a tat of less than 2 h and an hot of less than 2 min providing a flexible capacity for laboratories of all sizes additional features available on the system include the ability to generate customized reports eg statistical and trending reports and the potential for a bidirectional interface with laboratory information systems in conclusion the eplex rp panel provides a rapid sensitive broadly multiplexed sample-to-results option with minimal hands-on time the assay performance was equivalent to that of the biofire filmarray rp for all targets this new fully integrated instrument is easily expandable and offers a great option for the implementation of a multiplex assay in larger-volume laboratories  infections caused by influenza viruses among children in poland

2018 the most effective way to prevent the infections among children is seasonal flu vaccination administered every season committee on infectious diseases 2017 according to the advisory committee on immunization practices in the usa a trivalent vaccine is recommended from the age of 6 months for the 201718 epidemic season grohskopf et al 2017 unfortunately the highest percentage of hospitalizations and deaths is recorded in infants 6 months of age zawocka et al 2016 to protect newborns who are at high risk of complications after influenza infection a cocoon vaccination strategy is recommended people from the immediate infant environment such as parents grandparents or siblings are vaccinated against influenza which protects the child against the illness in a secondary manner nitsch-osuch 2017 the quadrivalent vaccines which have been already developed are recommended from the age of 3 years due to the lack of available research in younger children this study seeks to define the prevalence of influenza infection in the population of children up to the age of 14 years and of the type of prevailing influenza virus causing infection among children during the 201718 epidemic season in poland the study group included children up to 14 years of age with an additional division into three successive age groups of 04 59 and 1014 years old the material for the study were nasal and throat swabs taken during the 201718 epidemic season and analyzed in 16 voivodship sanitary and epidemiological stations and in the department of influenza research national influenza center in the national institute of public health  national institute of hygiene niph-nih in warsaw poland during the epidemic season 1286 samples were tested for influenza and reported in the sentinel and non-sentinel influenza surveillance system the ribonucleic acid rna was isolated from the nasal and pharyngeal swabs a maxwell 16 viral total nucleic acid purification kit was used promega corporation madison wi according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer from 200 l of clinical samples suspended in 1 ml of physiological saline 50 l of rna resuspended in rnase-free water was obtained molecular tests were performed to confirm the presence of influenza a and b viruses and to determine the viral subtypes the light cycler 20 system was used roche diagnostics rotkreuz switzerland the primers and probes were obtained from the international reagent resource irr run by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the reaction was carried out according to the manufacturers instructions rna was subjected to reverse transcription at 50 c for 30 min the obtained dna was subjected to the initiating denaturation process 1 cycle at 95 c for 2 min followed by 45 cycles of amplification denaturation at 95 c for 15 s annealing at 55 c for 10 s and elongation at 72 c for 20 s positive control was the viral rna obtained from the strains used for the

human parainfluenza 1 2 3 and 4 viruses human rhinovirus abc human enterovirus and human bocavirus 1234 the rv15 onestep ace detection kit seeplex seoul south korea was used for these reactions according to the manufacturers instructions after the reaction the product was separated on a 2 agarose gel using electrophoresis discrete data were presented as counts and proportions differences between the proportions of infected people were compared with a t-test a value of zero was assumed for the noninfected person and a value of one for the infected one and the arithmetic mean was used to calculate the percentage of the infected persons a p-value 001 defined statistically significant differences the prevalence of influenza in the age groups was determined with 95 confidence intervals 95ci in the 201718 epidemic season there were 1286 samples tested from children up to 14 years of age we noticed the co-dominance of influenza a and b viruses in the whole of childrens population 539 and 461 respectively among the influenza a viruses subtype ah1n1pdm09 was confirmed in 185 of all positive samples and it prevailed over subtype ah3n2 fig 1
 in the childrens population stratified into the age groups of 04 59 and 1014 years influenza a virus dominated in 04 year olds accounting for 288 the infections caused by influenza b virus were noticed in 144 in this group a different situation was noticed in the age groups of 59 and 1014 years where influenza b virus dominate accounting for 341 and 315 of infections respectively in all three age groups the unsubtyped infections of influenza a dominated accounting for 178 172 and 107 of infections respectively whereas subtype ah3n2was present in the lowest proportions 04 12 and 07 respectively fig 2
 the results were also analyzed taking into account only the type of influenza virus and the patients age there were a significantly lower percentage of children infected with influenza a virus in the age group 1014 years than in the groups 04 and 59 years p  0001 and p  001 respectively the difference in the number of influenza a virus infections between the age groups 04 and 59 years was insignificant p  021 in addition there was a significantly higher percentage of children infected with influenza b virus in the age groups 59 and 1014 years than in the group 04 years p  0001 the difference in the number of influenza b virus infections between the age groups 59 and 1014 was insignificant p  028 a comparative analysis of the 201718 and 201617 epidemic seasons was also performed for the age group 04 years in the former season there was a clear dominance of influenza a 111 infections and subtype ah3n2 74 infections in contradistinction in the latter season co-dominance of influenza a and b viruses 209 and 104 infections respectively was recorded there was a clear difference in the dominant subtype of the influenza a virus in the former season it was subtype ah3n2 while in the latter season it was ah1n1pdm09 in the 201617 season there were only two infections of influenza b virus and none of ah1n1pdm09 virus infection fig 3
 the influenza-like infections were reported in the 04 and 59 age groups and accounted for 812 and 188 respectively fig 4 among children aged 1014 years no influenza-like virus was reported influenza-like viruses were dominated by rsv 30 infections the highest number of infections with this virus was recorded in the age group 04 years in this group there also were four piv-3 infections and single infections with other influenza-like viruses
 in the 201718 epidemic season influenza a and b viruses co-dominated in the population of children under the age of 14 years with a margin of influenza b over a these results are akin to those noticed in other european countries eg denmark or spain flu news europe 2018 among the influenza a viruses infections with subtype ah1n1pdm09 dominated over ah3n2 this season had entirely different characteristics from the preceding 201617 season in poland when no ah1n1pdm09 infections had been reported among children cielak et al 2018 an interesting tendency appeared in the analysis of the prevailing viral contagion by childrens age in the older children of 59 and 1014 years there was a significantly higher incidence of influenza b infection than in the youngest children of 04 years that is in line with the past results from other european research centers in one of them results from 12 european countries have been analyzed with reference to the 201213 season and the dominance of influenza b virus is reported in children aged 514 years beaut et al 2015 in another study the relation between influenza virus type and subtypes and the age of children was determined that analysis covers 29 countries around the world in the years 19992014 it has been confirmed that infections with influenza b virus most often occur in the 517 age bracket caini et al 2018 the present report demonstrates the lowest percentage of influenza a in the oldest children aged 1014 further infection with subtype ah3n2constituted the lowest percentage of influenza a in each age group this last trend seems to have been in line with the notion put forward by adlhoch et al 2018 suggesting that subtype ah3n2 may be the most common in older persons particularly aged over 65 rather than in children this report also demonstrates that unsubtyped influenza a was the most prevalent across all the age groups of children this finding however may contain a spurious component due to possibly ineffective subtyping of influenza virus or occasional lack of subtyping it at all despite these limitations we believe we have demonstrated in this report that there is a relation between the childs age and the type of influenza virus causing infection in the 201718 epidemic season the youngest children under 4 years were the most vulnerable to both influenza and influenza-like infections the former caused mostly by influenza a and the latter by rsv in contradistinction influenza b dominated in the oldest children aged 1014 and rsv infections were not present in this age group however characteristics of influenza viruses are highly changeable season to season these data may thus not exactly apply to each and every epidemic season  comparison of three rapid influenza diagnostic tests with digital readout systems and one conventional rapid influenza diagnostic test sook ryu won in suh bum semin ryu kyu shin sung hyonsuk kim juwon kim young uh kap yoon jun jonghan lee   seasonal influenza infection can be a burden on public health authorities rapid diagnosis is an important initial step in the appropriate management of influenza disease traditionally viral cultures serological tests rapid antigen tests and molecular methods have been used to diagnose influenza infection1 rapid influenza diagnostic tests ridts have been used widely in the clinical setting because they can be handled readily and at relatively low cost although they have low and variable detection sensitivities thus a negative ridt result does not confirm a status free of influenza virus infection the clinical sensitivities of these tests have been reported to range from 20 to 90 according to sample collection method storage and transport specimen type swab and transport media used and degree of adherence to manufacturers recommendations for test procedures1 the performance of ridts is also dependent on the prevalence of the influenza viruses circulating in the population2 3 furthermore clinicians should be cautious about using ridts in certain patient populations and with respect to how the results should be interpreted3 4 5 thus further validation of ridts should be provided before routine clinical use in this study we compared three ridts with digital readout systems and one conventional ridt with respect to the detection sensitivity and relative limit of detection according to influenza subtype buddi nanoentek is a newly developed digital readout system to diagnose influenza virus the method is based on immunochromatography and a digital readout system briefly an antibody colloidal gold probe was applied on the conjugate pad and influenza antibody was immobilized to a nitrocellulose membrane as the capture reagent to prepare the ridt strip test equal volumes of specimen in utm 75 l and reagent buffer 75 l were mixed thoroughly and five drops 100 l of mixed sample was loaded into the test device in 15 minutes the buddi device reads the intensity of the reaction band if the band intensity is higher than a cutoff level buddi reports a positive result of influenza infection this test required less than 30 minutes to accomplish the qualitative detection of influenza antigen the results of the buddi system can be transferred to a central laboratory or the centers for disease control cdc via an appropriate wireless network the sofia influenza ab fluorescence immunoassay quidel is a rapid diagnostic kit that uses immunofluorescence technology to enhance its sensitivity it detects the nucleoprotein of the influenza virus and can discriminate strain a from b in nasal swabs aspirates and nasopharyngeal swab specimens this test uses a lateral flow design with locationdependent lines and zones the sofia analyzer scans the test strip and displays the results after using methodspecific algorithms this assay can be completed within 15 minutes and results are reported as positive or negative for influenza virus a or b without providing the numerical value assigned for each specimen briefly equal volumes of specimen in utm 250 l and reagent buffer prepared by reconstituting lyophilized buffer with detergent and reducing agent 250 l were mixed in a reaction tube a final volume of 120 l of sample was placed in a sofia reaction cassette using a premeasured pipette incubated for 15 minutes and analyzed using the sofia fluorescent reader the results also can be interfaced directly using a local area network lan to a laboratory information system bd veritor system flu ab assay bd diagnostics is a rapid qualitative chromatographic immunoassay for the detection of influenza a and b viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with a timetoresult of 10 minutes the system comprises a unique reagent tube containing mucolytic agents and a detergent solution a test device and a digital reader when nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens are processed with the reagent tube and added to the test device influenza a or b viral antigens bind to antiinfluenza antibodies conjugated to detector particles in the test strip the antigenconjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is captured by antibodies against influenza a influenza b and a control antibody on three separate membranes6 for this study 75 l of specimen in utm was mixed with an equal volume of lysis buffer 75 l three drops 80 l of the mixed sample were placed into a veritor test device cassette and allowed 10 minutes for incubation then the cassette was placed into the colorimetric reader for analysis the sd bioline influenza ag abah1n12009 standard diagnostics is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of influenza virus types a and type b using embedded mouse monoclonal antiinfluenza a and antiinfluenza b antibodies on the test strip7 briefly 75 l of nasopharyngeal specimen in utm was mixed with the same volume of reagent solution the test strip was inserted into a tube containing the total volume of 150 l of the reaction mixture test results were examined visually and interpreted after 1015 minutes viral rnas were extracted from 530 l of the nasopharyngeal specimen using the seeprep12 viral na kit seegene and the seeprep12 viral na instrument seegene this is an automated nucleic acid na extraction system for downstream detection for extracting and purifying nas using a magnetic bead method an internal control 10 l was added to each specimen before the extraction step to confirm the entire process from na extraction

manufacturers instructions briefly 5 l of rna was added to 20 l onestep rtpcr master mix solution containing 5 fluab om 5 anyplex rtpcr buffer anyplex rtpcr enzyme mix and rnasefree water positive and negative controls were included in each run the cfx96 realtime thermocycler biorad hercules ca usa was used for amplification and detection of the signal conditions were as follows initial incubation at 50c for 20 minutes and 95c for 15 minutes followed by 45 cycles of 95c for 30 seconds and 55c for 60 seconds a comparison study was performed to compare the influenza subtype detection capacity among four different ridt assays using 20 different influenza antigen reagents from the national institute for biological standards and control nibsc first the stock solution of each subtype reagent was diluted in the recommended buffer to 512 ngml then the 512 ngml nibcs influenza a subtypes were diluted serially to 128 64 16 8 4 2 and 1 ngml the 512 ngml nibcs influenza b subtypes were diluted serially to 128 64 16 and 8 ngml the diluted subtype reagents were measured to determine and compare the detection limit of each ridt the nonspecific positive results of four kinds of ridts with other respiratory viruses excluding influenza viruses were identified all of 29 respiratory swab specimens were confirmed by realtime pcr seegene rv16 realtime pcr seegene seoul korea using manufacturers recommended realtime pcr protocol the rv16 realtime pcr has been updated from previous reports9 10 11 12 those swab specimens had five adenovirus adv one parainfluenza virus 1 piv 1 one parainfluenza

ridts were compared according to sample volume assay time discrimination of influenza a and b recommended specimen types and test principles we briefly describe the specifications of each ridt in table 1 also the 218 enrolled samples were classified as 73 cases of influenza a 60 of influenza b and 85 negatives table 2 for influenza a buddi sofia veritor and bioline showed 877 945 877 and 726 detection sensitivity and 100 977 965 and 100 detection specificity respectively the positive predictive value ppv and negative predictive value npv were 100 972 955 100 and 904 954 901 81 respectively for influenza b buddi sofia veritor and bioline showed 817 917 817 and 783 detection sensitivity and 100 953 100 and 100 detection specificity respectively the positive predictive value ppv and negative predictive value npv were 100 932 100 100 and 885 942 885 867 respectively table 3 in children birth to 17 for influenza a buddi sofia veritor and bioline showed 921 974 947 and 763 detection sensitivity and 100 100 974 and 100 detection specificity respectively for influenza b buddi sofia veritor and bioline showed 843 941 863 and 824 detection sensitivity and 100 949 100 and 100 detection specificity respectively table 4 in adults over 17 for influenza a buddi sofia veritor and bioline showed 829 914 800 and 686 detection sensitivity and 100 957 957 and 100 detection specificity respectively for influenza b buddi sofia veritor and bioline showed 667 778 556 and 556 detection sensitivity and 100 957 100 and 100 detection specificity respectively table 4 serially diluted nibsc solutions showed some differences in lowlevel detection power between the ridts overall the digitalized influenza detection tests had a higher detection power than those of the conventional ridt also buddi showed high detection sensitivity for the atexas3691 abeijing26295 and asydney597 influenza subtypes sofia showed high detection sensitivity for atexas3691 asingapore157 avietnam11942004 and acambodiaro4050502007 veritor showed high detection sensitivity for asydney597 anew york552004 avietnam11942004 and acambodiaro4050502007 specific subtypes of influenza a such as aequinenewmarket193 h3n8 could not be detected by the sofia or bioline in 512 ngml nibsc stock solution for the influenza b subtype sofia had better detection sensitivity than the other ridts table 5 we identified that four ridts did not show crossreactivity results in 29 specimens which had other respiratory viruses excluding influenza viruses influenza can be a major public health burden both influenza a and influenza b have caused over 200 000 hospitalizations and 30 00050 000 deaths13 14 15 16 17 diagnosis of influenza infections include viral isolation in cell culture immunofluorescence assays nucleic acid amplification tests immunochromatographybased rapid diagnostic tests etc18
 the rapid diagnosis of influenza may help in managing patients and lowering overall treatment costs the available rapid diagnostic assays are relatively simple to perform and can produce results within less than 30 minutes but they suffer from inaccuracy with widely varying diagnostic sensitivities and specificities3 19 indeed ridts may have inconsistent accuracy with reported sensitivities ranging from 10 to 803 5 20 21 whereas specificity usually exceeds 90 in this study we evaluated a new ridt buddi for the first time buddi is underpinned by an immunochromatographic method with a digital readout system the reaction band of buddi is digitalized according to reaction intensity final results of buddi can be transferred through a network to another place to help rapid diagnosis the sensitivities were higher in the digital readout systems than in the conventional ridt as we expected sofia showed the highest sensitivity for influenza a and b detection buddi showed the same sensitivity as veritor the cause of the difference may be related to the immunofluorescence technology of sofia which enhances its sensitivity in this study we identified 66 influenza h1n1 subtype among 73 influenza a type persons 904 through realtime pcr it is important to understand the detection power of ridt according to the influenza subtypes because influenza shows seasonal variations specific influenza subtypes should be considered in upgrade of ridts we also compared the four ridts according to the nibsc subtype of influenza to evaluate the detection power of each test there were some differences in detection power according to nibsc subtype buddi showed high detection sensitivity for atexas3691 abeijing26295 and asydney597 sofia showed high detection sensitivity for atexas3691 asingapore157 avietnam11942004 and acambodiaro4050502007 veritor showed high detection sensitivity for asydney597 anew york552004 avietnam11942004 and acambodiaro4050502007 however specific subtypes such as abeijing3292 bioline and aequinenewmarket193 sofia and bioline bmalaysia25062004 buddi veritor and bioline bphuket30732013 buddi veritor and bioline bbrisbane602008 buddi veritor and bioline could not be detected at the level of the 512 ngml nibsc stock solution these differences could be caused by different coverage levels of monoclonal antibodies to specific influenza subtypes ridts should be updated to target prevalent influenza subtypes and to identify many influenza subtypes to increase detection sensitivity this study had some limitations first we did not include large number of samples and various influenza subtypes second the mean age of the enrolled individuals was relatively young at 10322 years for a random selection within a specific period cruz et al2 reported that the performance of ridts have been known to be better in children compared with adults approximately 13 higher maybe due to higher viral loads and longer viral shedding in children compared with adults we also identified the higher sensitivity of four ridts in children group than those of adults in our study third test results were compared only with those of realtime pcr which could have false positives and negatives also only nasopharyngeal swab specimens were included without considering specimen variations however for the first time this study presented the detection sensitivity of a newly developed digital readout system buddi the buddi had the same detection sensitivity as a previously launched ridt veritor and higher sensitivity than a conventional ridt however buddi showed less sensitivity than sofia also buddi could detect more than other ridts in terms of specific influenza biotypes such as influenza a atexas3691 abeijing26295 and asydney597 in conclusion ridts with digital readout systems showed higher detection sensitivity than a conventional rapid test the fluorescence technique of sofia gave it the highest detection sensitivity but there were differences in lowlevel detection power according to influenza subtype further welldesigned prospective studies are needed for additional assessment of the value of updated ridts according to specific influenza subtypes  from the national institutes of health hepatitis workshops of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases   the collaborative research program of the n ational institute of allergy and infectious diseases is sponsoring a series of workshops on hepatitis as part of its overall hepatitis program which has as its goal the development of methods for the prevention of hepatitis a and b three recent workshops in this series include 1 antigenic subtypes of australia antigen december 17 1971  2 hepatitis animal model systems january 14 1972 and 3 hepatitis and immune complexes january 26-27 1972 antigenic subtypes the first of these three workshops focused on a discussion of the antigenic subtypes of hepatitis b hepatitis b antigen haa hb agl or australia antigen was first detected in the serum of an australian aborigine later it was recognized that this antigen is associated with hepatitis b it is now known that sera from patients with hepatitis b may manifest several immunologic specificities as demonstrated by the double-diffusion precipitin reacdon at this meeting the participants agreed that an antigenic determinant known as a was common to all hepatitis b antigens thus far studied and may be regarded as the group-specific antigen either the d or the y determinant but not both is usually associated with the groupspecific antigen a the d subtype possessing both a and d determinants accounts for 40-50 of cases while y subtype possessing both a and y determinants also accounts for 40 -50 of cases in less than 1 of blood samples tested only the a antigen is detected this might be because the subtype antigens are too weak for detection are blocked are destroyed or are not made or it might be because a new unidentified subtype is present further research is needed to resolve the existence and character of other antigenic determinants some of the evidence pre- 1 the abbreviation hb ag for hepatitis b antigen has been accepted by the committee on viral hepatitis of the division of medical sciences national academy of sciences-national research council however pending editorial decision the journal retains the old abbreviation haa 112 sented suggests that the y determinant is more likely to occur in acute self-limited hepatitis than is the d determinant as a corollary d is more likely to be found in chronic hepatitis and in the chronic asymptomatic carrier this association between chronicity and the d subtypes suggests that persistent antigenemia relates at least in part to the infecting agent rather than being solely determined by response of the host it was reported that the 22-nm monomer forms of the ay and ad subtypes are composed of at least six polypeptides with varying amino-acid compositions the participants of this workshop discussed nomenclature of subtypes and agreed that until further information becomes available the terms a d and y should continue to be used in describing antigenic determinants of hepatitis b animal models the workshop on hepatitis animal-model systems discussed methods of propagating the agents of hepatitis a and b past attempts to propagate hepatitis agents in tissue culture have been either unsuccessful or unsubstantiated recently carver and seto 1 have exposed human wi-38 cells to human serum containing haa these cells are then rendered refractory to infection by newcastle disease virus according to hemadsorption tests this technique may represent one of the more promising approaches to growing the agent of hepatitis b in tissue culture the use of nonhuman primates as animal models for hepatitis was discussed and analyzed as to its practicality participants in this workshop reported some success in infecting the chimpanzee and the rhesus monkey with hepatitis b it was reported that general susceptibility of primates to hepatitis b as recognized by development of antibody to the hepatitis b antigen appears to parallel the phylogenetic scale with those primates closest to man being the most susceptible studies on infection of primates with hepatitis a indicate that the marmoset can serve as a potential animal model for this type of hepatitis it appears at this time that certain nonhuman primates eg chimpanzees gibbons orangutans cannot serve as practical laboratory models for research on hepatitis since these animals are a limited resource very expensive and diffi-cult to handle and care for the establishment of breeding colonies for such primates as saguinus mystax and macaca mulatta would be a great help in protecting the natural reservoir of these animals and in providing a source of good animals for research as a consequence of the limited usefulness of certain nonhuman primates chimpanzees gibbons etc in research on hepatitis emphasis should be placed on development of tissue-culture techniques for growth of hepatitis agents and on development of potential materials for vaccines immune complexes the purposes of the workshop on immune complexes were to review current knowledge on immune complexes to discuss the role that such antigen-antibody complexes might play on the pathogenesis of hepatitis b infection and to attempt to formulate a hypothesis on the effects that the administration of gamma globulin with high titers of antibody to haa would have on the formation of hepatitis immune complex circulating antigen-antibody complexes are detected by a variety of procedures including 1  use of isolated rheumatoid factors which precipitate aggregates of gamma globulin and immune complexes but not free gamma globulin 2 use of clq an isolated component of complement to precipitate immune complexes 3 precipitation of immune complexes at low temperatures and 4 use of the ultracentrifuge to separate complexes from free antigen and antibody other techniques that might be used with various degrees of success to detect hepatitis immune complexes include electrophoresis complement fixation immunofluorescence platelet aggregation and electron microscopy in the future radioimmunoassay might be applied to the detection of hepatitis immune complexes immune complexes may cause the following reactions 1  activation of complement 2  degranulation of mast cells with release of such substances as histamine and 3 release of platelet polymorphonuclear and lysosomal contents the pathophysiologic consequences of these reactions could include contraction of smooth muscle increased vascular permeability destruction of tissue and proliferation of endothelial cells it was pointed out that the large immune complexes greater than 198 are most harmful since they are not phagocytized and are deposited 113 in tissue causing the above-mentioned damage to that tissue the immune-complex syndrome might be summarized as follows 1 formation of circulating antigen-antibody complexes which cause 2 the release of vasoactive amines followed by 3 increased vascular permeability leading to 4 deposit of the complexes along filtering vascular membranes which causes 5 either nonpolymorphonuclear-mediated vascular injury or polymorphonuclear-mediated vascular injury through activation of complement deposition of immune complexes in the tissue might be due to deposition of circulating complexes or to deposit of antibody on cells in which viral replication takes place current evidence supports the hypothesis that when the hepatitis b agent invades the body two types of reactions are initiated 1 the agent invades the liver cells replicates and antigen is released 2 the hepatitis b agent stimulates the lymphoid system to produce antibodies because of the presence of both the hepatitis-b antigen and antibody immune complexes are formed which may either circulate or remain in local tissue sites electron microscopic studies of liver biopsies from persons positive for the hepatitis b antigen indicate a variety of hepatic involvements immunohistochemical study of liver biopsies using fluorescein-conjugated human antiserum to haa or by indirect immunofluorescence with guineapig antiserum to haa demonstrates various patterns of distribution of this virus-associated antigen the antigen is usually observed in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in a focal distribution within the liver it is less commonly found diffusely in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes granular deposition of the antigen in nonhepatocytes including kupffer cells sinusoidal endothelial cells and infiltrating mononuclear cells is also seen particularly in latter stages or during persistent infection evidence that immunoglobulin and complement components are deposited together in the last group suggests intrahepatic localization of immune complexes of antibody to haa an electron microscopic study of three cases of hepatitis representing the carrier state chronic active hepatitis and fulminant hepatitis showed the following antigenic patterns respectively 1 persistent antigen and no evidence of anti-body or complexes 2 excess of antigen and presence of antigen-antibody complex 3 excess of antibody and persistence of anaphylactogenic immune complexes when there is free antigen the patient is healthy but with the development of antibody hepatic function becomes abnormal using the electron microscope various investigators have seen dane particles 42 nm which are composed of an outer core and an inner spherical 27-nm diameter component the outer core appears to be antigenically related to haa and the inner core bears some morphologic resemblance to the rhinovirus the dane particle can be disrupted with tween 80 treatment into these two components but the inner component may be unstable antibody to haa and antibody to the inner core of the dane particle might be associated with hepatitis b although the role of these two antibodies in immune-complex formation or in protective immunity to hepatitis b infection is yet to be determined cell-mediated immune responses may also be involved in the conferral of immunity to hepatitis b cyclic adenosine 35 monophosphate and prostaglandins might also play a role in controlling the immune response to hepatitis b based on different forms of evidence the participants at the workshop agreed that hepatitis b disease may be complicated in certain cases by the formation of immune complexes when these immune complexes lodge in the tissue they initiate the typical immune-complex syndrome already outlined it has been shown by various investigators that administration of certain gammaglobulin preparations can help prevent hepatitis b infection it is not known whether the antibody to haa or some other antibody such as antibody to the inner core of the dane particle is the protective antibody the effect of administration of gamma globulin with high titers of antiserum to haa on immune-complex formation is not yet known particular caution should be exercised in administering gamma globulin to persons positive for hepatitis-b antigen research during the past few years has shown that members of the newly defined coronavirus group have many properties in common although coronaviruses cause illness in man chickens swine mice and rats approaches to basic and comparative virology are seldom separable on the basis of species on january 31 1972 the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid sponsored an international workshop to review the relevance and relationship of the presently known coronaviruses to identify

qian jingwen ai jing wu shenglei yu peng cui yan gao jialin jin xinhua weng wenhong zhang   after the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in order to track similarly highly contagious and severe lower respiratory illness with pneumonia symptoms the chinese government has paid great attention to unexplained pneumonia up a phrase coined by the chinese human unexplained pneumonia surveillance network chupsn and published in 2004 up refers to pneumonia which could be lifethreatening characterized by rapid progression a normal white blood cell count range and poor response to antibiotics1 although the common pathogens causing up are viruses or atypical pathogens their overlapping clinical manifestations can impede the ability of clinicians to directly diagnose the causative pathogens which may lead to unnecessary antimicrobial usage thus rapid and precise diagnosis of the causative agents is critical for the prompt management of up to date culturebased and other traditional methods have been used to help the clinical approach to diagnose up however these methods have certain disadvantages for example rapid antigen testing has only a 40100 sensitivity for adult influenza and is dependent on the use of specific scientific techniques whereas culturing viruses can take up to 10 days2 in recent years there has been an increase in the use of nucleic acid amplification test naatbased methods for the detection of viral pathogens due to their excellent diagnostic ability in identifying a broad spectrum of pathogens3 filmarray multiplex pcr biofire diagnostics inc a biomrieux company is a naat method that can be used to detect multiple pathogens in a single test in may 2011 the filmarray respiratory panel farp was fda cleared for the detection of 17 respiratory viral pathogens including influenza a h12009 h3 h1 and not subtypedb respiratory syncytial virus rsv human metapneumovirus adenovirus coronavirus hku1 oc43 nl63 and 229e human rhinovirusenterovirus parainfluenza including subtype 1 2 3 and 4 and three bacteria bordetella pertussis chlamydophila pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae the turnaround time using this panel is approximately 1 hour thus this technique can ease the rapid and accurate identification of the pathogens causing up4
 with the increasing implementation of the farp in clinical microbiology laboratories further studies are required to determine the clinical diagnostic ability of the method and its influence on patient outcomes and antimicrobial usage accordingly in this study we aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of farp on up patient treatment compared with conventional methods to this end we prospectively enrolled patients diagnosed with up and analyzed the pathogen detection ability of the farp moreover we evaluated the clinical impact of farp on patients based on a comparison of the clinical outcomes and medical records of the patient cohort enrolled during the period from october 2016 to march 2018 with the data of a cohort retrospectively collected for the period between october 2014 and march 2016 we aimed to evaluate the effect of using the filmarray in terms of the quantification of antimicrobial use use of antiviral drugs and deescalation or adjustment of antibiotic treatment the prospective cohort was enrolled in shanghai china between october 2016 and march 2018 including two consecutive winter seasons eligible patients were recruited based on a modified definition of up by chupsn as follows a fever 38c b pneumonia radiographic results c normal or slightly decreased number of total white blood cells in the early stage of the disease d duration of illness of 14 days e poor response to initial antibiotic treatment and f a minimum age of 18 years old samples from all enrolled patients were submitted to farp analyses and were accordingly referred to as the farp group we recorded the demographic characteristics of patients and their relevant clinical data patients in the farp group who were not lost to followup and had complete data were referred to as the intervention group a historical control cohort was retrospectively recruited using the same inclusion criteria among patients who were hospitalized between october 2014 and march 2016 during which time the farp was not available similar to the farp group relevant data of the patients within the control cohort were recorded within 24 hours of patient admission respiratory tract specimens were collected including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf among those patients who gave consent to undergo bronchoscopy sputum if expectoration was evident and nasopharyngeal swab nps if no bronchoscopy was performed or no expectoration sample was collected notably lower respiratory tract specimens were given higher priority balf  sputum  nps during the study as soon as possible after sampling the specimens were transferred to the laboratory of infectious diseases research institute huashan hospital shanghai professional pulmonary physicians oversaw balf sampling while the collection of nps and sputum was performed by clinical physicians per the clinical standard operating procedure notably those samples of nps and balf for which the viscosity was low required no further sample preparation before filmarray panel testing whereas viscous samples such as sputum were pretreated using the previously described dunk and swirl method5 the remaining specimens were stored in a 80c freezer for further use in this study we used version 17 of the farp it is an automated multiplex pcr detection platform designed to detect 20 common pathogens causing respiratory infection and has a single specimen turnaround time of 2 hours tests using the panel were performed following the manufacturers instructions for specimens that the farp reported as

kits influenza ab influenza ah1n12009 avian influenza ah7n9 and avian influenza ah5n1 viral rna detection kits from fluorescence pcr were used in accordance with the respective manufacturers instructions for the detection of viral rna nucleic acids were extracted from 200l aliquots of each clinical specimen using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit individual realtime pcr assays were performed

for detection for all sets of primers and probes notemplate controls were included in each reaction plate specimens that reached the threshold before 35 cycles were considered positive for both patient groups traditional standardofcare laboratory diagnostic tests for respiratory infections were performed according to the requests of physicians including smears cultures and serological tests the serological test in our study was the pneumoslide igm vircell commercial kit based on indirect immunofluorescence in this study clinical data including antimicrobial use and adjustment or deescalation of antimicrobial therapy were compared between the farp group and retrospective control group turnaround time was defined as the length of time from sample collection to receiving the farp results antimicrobial use was quantified as the defined daily dose ddd number calculated as  drug total dosage gdrug ddd index6 adjustment of antimicrobial therapy was defined as a change in antimicrobial regimen immediately after receiving the farp results the mannwhitney u test was used for the comparison of quantitative data spss 200 ibm was used for data analyses we used graphpad 60 for drawing graphs the ethics committee of the huashan hospital shanghai approved the study ky2013251 july 2 2013 all participants gave their written informed consent a total of 112 eligible adult patients were prospectively included in the farp group from october 2016 to march 2018 and samples from all patients were evaluated using the farp among these 50 patients 446 50112 were hospitalized and for whom we had complete clinical data the remaining 62 patients 554 were lost to followup for outpatients or because of being transferred to other hospitals as the control group 70 eligible adult patients were retrospectively enrolled between october 2014 and march 2016 figure 1 the baseline characteristics of both patient groups are shown in table 1 among the 112 respiratory samples assessed using the farp 86 768 were positive and 26 232 were negative the detected pathogens included influenza a virus n  40 357 influenza b n  13 116 m pneumoniae n  8 71 adenovirus n  8 71 human

rhinovirusenterovirusparainfluenza2 n  1 and adenoviruscoronavirus hku1coronavirus oc43 n  1 for 13 samples the farp results were influenza anot subtyped in these cases further subtyping was performed using realtime rtpcr as a consequence influenza a virus subtype h7n9 was detected in 11 samples and h1n12009 in the remaining two samples among the patients in the farp group 538 60112 received antiviral treatment including oseltamivir and acyclovir compared with 127 1079 in the control group p  01 adjustment of antibiotic therapy was recorded for 696 78112 of the patients in the farp group compared with 51 479 in the control group p  01 as a consequence of the findings of the fafp regarding influenza a 15 patients were isolated in a negative pressure ward or single ward including seven highly pathogenic h7n9 cases in contrast in the control group no comparable isolation measures were undertaken when we compared antimicrobial use between the intervention and control groups we found that the two groups were comparable for the most baseline characteristics table 3 compared with the control group the intervention group showed no significant decrease of antimicrobial ddds control group 143  96 vs intervention group 138  46 p  05 however after excluding antiviral drugs we detected significantly lower antibioticantifungal ddds 141  88 vs 131  33 p  05 for the intervention group for patients with positive farp results both the antimicrobial and antibioticantifungal ddds were significantly lower compared with those in the control group antimicrobial 115  31 vs 143  96 p  05 antibioticsantifungals 106  25 vs 141  88 p  01 however for those patients in the intervention group with negative farp results the ddds were not significantly different from those of control group patients antimicrobials 141  63 vs 143  96 p  05 antibioticsantifungals 139  51 vs 141  88 p  05 table 4 in this study we applied farp on diagnosis of up which is a certain type of pneumonia causing mainly by viruses and atypical pathogens we found that the farp detected pathogens in 768 86112 of all specimens which is higher than that the detection rate obtained when this technique was applied for general communityacquired pneumonia 386 491277 these results therefore show that when applied clinically for up the farp would provide a higher probability of identifying causal pathogenic microorganisms the findings of the present study also confirmed that sputum and balf could be used as samples for farp tests which contrasts with the manufactures assertion that nps stored in viral transport media vtm is the only suitable material that is compatible indeed we obtained positive farp results for all the types of respiratory tract specimens notably however when performing this test pretreatment of specimens with high viscosity such as sputum is essential otherwise the reactions are likely to fail here we pretreated samples following the procedure described by branche5 using a clean swab to stir the sputum and then placing it into vtm so that the pathogens were transferred into a low viscosity medium that is suitable for the farp previous studies have reported that lower respiratory tract specimens should be accorded higher sampling priority ie balf  sputum  nps and have indicated that the performance of the farp in patients with pneumonia could be improved by using balf8 9 10 consistently in the present study we obtained higher positive rates when using balf and sputum samples than when using nps although the difference was not significant 788 vs 615 p  166 moreover in recent years saliva has also shown potential as a suitable material for the molecular detection of respiratory viruses11
 we prospectively enrolled patients diagnosed with up during the period from october 2016 to march 2018 and attempted to identify the causal pathogens we accordingly found that influenza a virus was most commonly reported causal agent followed by influenza b virus adenovirus rhinovirusenteric virus etc other studies on adult viral pneumonia have reported similar patterns of pathogen distribution12 13 with influenza viruses being the predominant causal agents although the proportion of influenza viruses detected in the present study was notably higher 473 vs 8 it is worth noting that for the commercial farp used in the present study identification of influenza a virus is limited to the h3 h1 and 2009h1 subtypes whereas for other subtypes such as h7n9 the farp can only provide the vague result of not subtyped influenza a however in mainland china influenza a virus h7n9 is one of the epidemic strains associated with up14 and indeed this strain was particularly prevalent during the winter and spring of 20162017 compared with other influenza a infection h7n9 patients tend to present with a more clinically severe manifestation and require more aggressive treatment thus in these cases further subtyping is necessary in the study we obtained test results of influenza a virus not subtyped in 13 cases among which 11 were finally identified as h7n9 based on realtime pcr consequently in clinical practice when farp reports a not subtyped influenza a virus further subtyping particularly for avian influenza virus including h7n9 h5n1 and h5n6 should be carried out immediately the findings of the present study show that the farp offers a relatively short turnaround time compared with traditional methods the median turnaround time from sampling to reporting the results to physicians was 16 hours compared with that of culturing more than 48 hours and serum igm tests more than 4 hours this feature of the farp may be of particular benefit with respect to the clinical management of pneumonia of unknown cause in the present study we found that 538 60112 of the patients in the farp group received antiviral treatment which is significantly higher than that in the control group 143 1070 p  001 among those patients who received a positive test result for the influenza virus 100 4343 were treated with oseltamivir that is notably higher than the 7481 reported in other studies carried out in the united states15 16 moreover adjustment of antibiotic therapy was reported for 696 78112 of the patients in the farp group compared with only 51 479 in the control group these findings strongly indicate that the results of the farp test may assist in clinical decision making particularly with respect to reducing unnecessary antibiotic usage in the treatment of up the rapid identification of pathogens causing respiratory tract infection has both essential clinical and public health values in the present study 15 of the enrolled patients were promptly isolated as soon as the diagnosis of influenza virus infection had been established in contrast for the control group patients who did not receive precise diagnosis of causing agents no comparable isolation measures were undertaken such a lack of an accurate diagnosis may lead to a delay in patient isolation and consequently the wider spread of viruses moreover for these patients we consciously sought to regularly analyze the viral nucleic acids in the patients respiratory specimens using realtime pcr and patients were discharged only after the nucleic acid test proved negative thereby reducing the risk of the disease spreading to further evaluate the clinical impact of the farp we compared the antibiotic use of adult up patients in the farp cohort and the historical control cohort the latter of which were diagnosed only by using conventional methods we found that compared with the control cohort the intervention group had significantly lower antimicrobial ddds particularly with respect to the use of antibiotics and antifungal drugs these results thus serve to highlight that given the benefit of an accurate diagnosis of the etiology a more reasonable antibiotic usage could be achieved these results are partially consistent with the findings of some previously published studies for example rogers et al17 evaluated the outcomes in pediatric patients 3 months to 21 years old admitted to hospital with an acute respiratory illness and similar to the findings of the present study found that the use of farp facilitated a reduction in the duration of antibiotic use and the length of hospitalization however another randomized controlled trial discovered that use of the farp was not associated with a reduction in the overall duration of antibiotic usage18 nevertheless a higher number of patients in the farp group received single doses or brief courses of antibiotics than those in the control group given these inconclusive findings further studies are required concerning the impact of farp on the clinical decisions regarding pneumonia we compared the duration of hospital stay between the two groups as a result intervention group unexpectedly showed longer duration of hospital stay than the control group 121 vs 76 days p  001 one reasonable explanation is that subjects in the intervention group had more severe cases of pneumonia than those in the control group higher psi table 3 that is a more severe condition may lead to a prolonged hospital stay more importantly stricter criteria of discharge were required for the intervention group according to regulations sanctioned by the chinese ministry of public health in 2009 discharge of influenza a h1n1 patients demands both a recovery of condition and two consecutive negative test results of viral nucleic acid in respiratory specimens therefore intervention group patients positive for influenza a took followup pcr tests the patients could not be discharged from the hospital until they met the criteria in contrast for the control group lacking precise diagnosis of causing agents no such criteria were required in our practice application of farp prolonged the length of stay however we believe additional benefits concerning public health and disease control were achieved this present study is one of the several that have examined the application of farp in asia19 20 21 22 23 24 compared with other published studies our study focused on adults with more severe pneumonia conditions and to the best of our knowledge it is the only study that has covered two consecutive pandemic seasons more importantly it describes the positive clinical impacts of the farp particularly in terms of antibiotic use similarly duan et al24 examined the use of the farp in the management of lower respiratory tract infections in a larger population in beijing a shorter length of hospitalization and a reduction in antibiotic use were observed other studies however tended to focus on the performance of the farp or merely a description of the detected pathogens our study does however have a few limitations notably the sample size was limited and the study was conducted only at a single location which may thus limit the general applicability of the findings in addition the study included two cohorts from different time periods hence there may have been differences in factors that influenced clinician behavior between the two periods that were not accounted in our analysis furthermore the incidence of various respiratory viruses may have varied across the two periods that may thus limit the validity of a direct comparison of clinical outcomes in conclusion the farp is a rapid and sensitive naat method that can be used for the diagnosis of up in adults in the two recent years in shanghai the most common pathogen causing up was identified as the influenza virus however in this regard it should be taken into consideration that the current version of the farp is unable to directly detect h7n9 nevertheless the results obtained in this study show that the farp may make a valuable contribution to clinical decision making and facilitate the reasonable use of antibiotics  decoding sars-cov-2 transmission and evolution and ramifications
for covid-19 diagnosis vaccine and medicine rui wang yuta hozumi changchuan yin guo-wei wei   the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has posed crucial
threats to public health and the world economy since it was detected in
wuhan china in december 201915 as of june 1 2020
6 057 853 cases of covid-19 have been reported in more than
200 countries and territories resulting in more than 371 166
deaths27 however there have been no signs of
slowing down nor relief at this monument partially due to the fact there are
no specific anti-sars-cov-2 drugs and effective vaccines sars-cov-2 is a positive-strand rna virus that belongs to the beta coronavirus
genus the genomic information underpins the development of antiviral
medical interventions prophylactic vaccines and viral diagnostic tests
the first sars-cov-2 genome was reported on january 5 202028 it has a genome size of 2999 kb which encodes for
multiple nonstructural and structural proteins the leader sequence and
orf1ab encode nonstructural proteins for rna replication and transcription
among various nonstructural proteins viral papain-like pl proteinase
main protease or 3cl protease rna polymerase and endoribonuclease are
the common targets in antiviral drug discovery yet it typically takes more
than ten years to put an average drug to the market the downstream regions
of the genome encode structural proteins including spike s protein
envelope e protein membrane m protein and nucleocapsid n protein
notably s-protein uses one of its two subunits to bind directly to the host
receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 enabling virus entry into
host cells29 the n protein one of the most abundant
viral proteins can bind to the rna genome and is involved in replication
assembly and host cellular response during viral infection13 as a virulence factor the e protein is a small integral
membrane protein that regulates cell stress response and apoptosis and
promotes inflammation4 the structural protein
especially the s protein is the candidate antigen for vaccine and antibody
drug development developing safe and effective vaccines is urgently needed
to prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 however it typically takes over one
year to design and test a new vaccine furthermore the replication in rna
viruses such as influenza a is subject to errors14
except nidoviruses coronaviruses a kind of nidoviruses have the ability
to proofread their genomes during their genetic replication and
recombination6 therefore sars-cov-2 might not
mutate as fast as influenza a viruses do but still has heterogeneous and
dynamic populations the sars-cov-2 genome undergoes rapid mutations that
are partially stimulated as a response to the challenging immunological
environments arising from its transmission to the covid-19 patients of
different races ages and medical conditions the vaccine developed at one time may not be effective for mitigating the
infection by new mutated virus isolates an alarming fact is that many of
these mutations may devastate the ongoing effort in the development of
effective medicines preventive vaccines and diagnostic tests accurate
identification of the antigens and their mutations represents the most
important roadblock in developing effective vaccines against covid-19 for
example different vaccines are needed for various geographic locations due
to predominant mutations in the corresponding regions in covid-19
diagnosis the diagnostic kits are designed using two major methods
serological tests and molecular tests serological tests are to detect
specific neutralizing antibodies from covid-19 infections molecular
diagnoses look for specific covid-19 pathogenic genes which usually rely on
the polymerase chain reaction pcr because of the fast mutations of the
sars-cov-2 genome genotyping analysis of sars-cov-2 may optimize the pcr
primer design to detect sars-cov safely and to reduce the risk of
false-negatives caused by genome sequence variations in addition the
genotyping analysis may also reveal those highly conserved regions with very
few mutations which can be selected as a target sequence for clinical
diagnosis and effective drug therapy the evolution pattern through the highly frequent mutations of sars-cov-2 can
be observable on short time scales in the early infection period ie
february 2020 the sars-cov-2 variants were clustered as s and l
types23 recent genotyping analysis reveals a large
number of mutations in various essential genes encoding the s protein the n
protein and the rna polymerase in the sars-cov-2 population30 monitoring the evolutionary patterns and spread dynamics
of sars-cov-2 is of great importance for covid-19 control and
prevention mutations occur in many different ways some mutations occur randomly other
mutations are enforced by the host immune system surveillance which induces
viral responses the most preserved mutations and viral evolution can be
regarded as the result of the dynamic equilibrium between the random
perturbation host cell defense and viral fitness therefore the faster
and wider the sars-cov-2 spread the more frequent and diverse the mutations
will be the tracking and analysis of covid-19 dynamics transmission and
spread are of paramount importance for winning the ongoing battle against
covid-19 genetic identification and characterization of the geographic
distribution intercontinental evolution and global trends of sars-cov-2
are the most effective approaches for studying covid-19 genomic epidemiology
and offer the molecular foundation for region-specific sars-cov-2 vaccine
design drug discovery and diagnostic development16 for
example different vaccines for the shell can be designed according to
predominant mutations this work provides the most comprehensive genotyping to reveal the transmission
trajectory and spread dynamics of covid-19 to date based on genotyping
15 140 sars-cov-2 genomes from the world as of june 1 2020 we trace
the covid-19 transmission pathways and analyze the distribution of the
subtypes of sars-cov-2 across the world we use k-means
methods to cluster sars-cov-2 mutations which provides updated molecular
information for the region-specific design of vaccines drugs and
diagnoses our clustering results show that globally there are at least
six distinct subtypes of sars-cov-2 genomes while in the us there are
four significant sars-cov-2 genotypes we introduce mutation
h-index and mutation ratio to characterize
conservative and nonconservative proteins and genes we unveil the
unexpected nonconservative genes and proteins rendering a warning for the
current development of diagnostic tests preventive vaccines and
therapeutic medicines tracking the sars-cov-2 transmission pathways and analyzing the spread
dynamics are critical to the study of genomic epidemiology
temporospatially clustering the genotypes of sars-cov-2 in the
transmission provides insights into diagnostic testing and vaccine
development in disease control in this work we retrieve and genotype
15 140 sars-cov-2 isolates from the world as of june 1 2020
there are 8309 single mutations in 15 140 sars-cov-2 isolates
based on these mutations we classify and track the geographical
distributions of 15 140 genotype isolates by
k-means clustering the sars-cov-2 genotypes
represented as single nucleotide polymorphism snp variants are
clustered as six groups in the world including the us in
particular the genotypes in the us are further clustered into four

corresponds to its dominant cluster we note that cluster d in the
us is derived from cluster v in the world with an additional
mutation at the leader sequence 241 the high spread in new york is
consistent with the high transmission of sars-cov-2 in european
countries where the subtype in cluster v is predominant figures 3 and 4 depict the distribution and frequencies of
snp mutations of sars-cov-2 isolates from 15 140 genome
samples in the world with respect to the reference genome of
january 5 2020 the statistics of single mutations on various
sars-cov-2 proteins that occurred in the recorded genomes
between january 5 2020 and june 1 2020 are listed in table 5 the spike
protein has the highest number of mutations on gene of 1004
while the envelope protein has the lowest number of mutations of
52 since the sizes of proteins vary dramatically from 1273 for
the spike protein to 75 for the envelope protein it is useful
to consider the mutation ratio ie the number of mutations
per residue in this category the rna-dependent rna polymerase
has the lowest score of 0217 whereas the nucleocapsid protein
has the highest score of 0400 ie 503 mutations on its 1257
nucleotides 419 residues note that main protease has the
second-lowest mutation ratio of 0221 indicating its
conservative nature another relatively conservative protein
judged by the mutations ratio in terms of gene is the envelope
protein the mrgene  0231 counting the number of single mutations and mutation ratio does not
reflect the fact that some mutations occur numerous times over
genome samples while other mutations may happen only on a few
genome samples to account for the frequency effect of
mutations we introduce a mutation h-index to
measure both the number of mutations and the frequency of
mutations of a given protein or genetic section it is defined
as the maximum value of h such that the given
protein genetic section has h single mutations
that have each occurred at least h times it is
very interesting to note from table 5 that the mutation
h-index correlates very well with the
number of mutations on gene the pearson correlation coefficient
is 0711 specifically n protein has both the highest
mrgene of 0400 and the highest
h-index of 33 suggesting that it is the
most nonconservative protein in sars-cov-2 genomes in contrast
the envelope protein has the third-lowest number of mutations
per residues of 0231 and the lowest h-index of
9 indicating its relatively conservative nature by combining
the number of mutations per residue and the mutation
h-index we report that the most
conservative sars-cov-2 proteins is the envelope it is found
that the most nonconservative sars-cov-2 proteins are 1 the
nucleocapsid protein 2 the spike protein and 3 the
papain-like protease the number of mutations in terms of gene nmgene and
the number of mutations in terms of protein nmpro
we reported are accumulated numbers that from all of the
15 140 genome isolates if we focus on the single genome
isolate the maximum number of mutations on the whole genome
sequence is 24 real-time rt-pcr rrt-pcr is routinely used in the qualitative
detection of nucleic acid from sars-cov-2 for diagnostic testing
covid-19324 the primers used in the
rrt-pcr are critical for the precise diagnosis of covid-19 and
the discovery of new strains the primer sequences are specially
designed for amplifying the conserved regions across the
different existing strains for high specificity and sensitivity
and also are subject to genotype changes as the sars-cov-2
coronavirus evolves in diagnostic testing covid-19 many
rrt-pcr primers are designed to detect for three perceived
conservative sars-cov-2 regions 1 rna-dependent rna
polymerase rdrp gene in orf1ab region 2 the e protein gene
and 3 the n protein gene3 our genotyping
statistics given in table 5 indicate that the nucleocapsid protein is the
worst choice among the four structural proteins of sars-cov-2 the spike surface
glycoprotein s of 1273 amino acid residues nucleocapsid
protein n of 419 amino acid residues membrane protein m of
222 amino acid residues and envelope protein e protein of 75
amino acid residues the s protein is the most divergent with
1004 unique mutations among the 15 140 sars-cov-2
genomes the n protein has 503 unique mutations and the
envelope e protein has 52 mutations considering the lengths
of the proteins all the four structural proteins undergo many
mutations the rdrp gene which is often used in diagnostic
testing covid-19 also has 607 mutations therefore all three regions in the routine rrt-pcr target namely
rdrp the n protein gene and the e protein genes have
significant mutations precise and robust diagnosis tools must
be re-established according to the conserved regions and
predominated mutations in the sars-cov-2 genomes detailed in the
supporting information vaccines are mostly associated with the s protein compared to
sars-cov sars-cov-2 has a unique furin cleavage site where
four amino acid residues prra are inserted into the
s1s2 junction region 681684 of the s
protein25 the furin cleavage site is
crucial for zoonotic transmission of sars-cov-27 this study reveals crucial mutations near the
s1s2 junction region in the s protein including
23403ag-d614g 23422ct-v620v 23575ct-c671c
23586ag-q675r 23611ga-r683r 23707ct-p715p
23731ct-t723t 23849tc-l763l and
23929ct-y789y moreover these mutations of the s protein
sars-cov-2 are located at the epitope region corresponding to
the regions 469882 and 599620 in
sars-cov19 additionally many mutated amino acids are on the receptor-binding
domain rbd of the s protein as shown in figure 5 unfortunately the s
protein is the second most nonconservative protein in the genome
based on the number of mutations per residue and mutation
h-index in fact about half of the
receptor-binding domain residues of the s proteins have had
mutations in the past few months as shown in figure 6 because the surface
accessibility of epitope is also important for the interaction
of antibody and antigen these mutations are critical for the
antigenicity of the s protein convalescent covid-19 patients show a neutralizing antibody
response after infection which is directed mostly against the s
protein18 the neutralizing antibody
responses against sars-cov-2 could give some defense against
sars-cov-2 infection thus having implications for preventing
sars-cov-2 outbreaks the divergence of s proteins and the
nonconserved regions of the s proteins might contribute to the
antigenicity the highly frequent mutations identified in the s
protein may reduce the durability of the sars-cov-2
vaccines immunity or undermine the current development
of vaccines the existing mutations must be considered when
designing a new vaccine additionally a cocktail of multiple
vaccines has a better chance of preventing covid-19
infections unfortunately there is no specific effective drug for sars-cov-2
at this point potential drugs include small-molecular drugs and
antibody drugs much of the effort in small-molecular drug
discovery focuses on sars-cov-2 nonstructural proteins among
the major nonstructural proteins of sars-cov-2 the main
protease of 306 amino acids has 78 mutations with 0255
mutations per residue and the mutation h-index
of 16 rna polymerase of 932 amino acids has 228 mutations with
0245 mutations per residue and the mutation
h-index of 21 and papain-like protease of 945
amino acids has 105 mutations with 0333 mutations per residue
and the mutation h-index of 10 in fact the
main protease is the most popular drug target because there are
no similar known genes in the human genome which implies that
sars-cov-2 main protease inhibitors will likely be less
toxic10 the present study suggests
that the main protease is the second most conservative protein
therefore it remains the most attractive target for drug
discovery therapeutic antibodies got started from cancer treatments and now
applies to infectious diseases by targeting pathogens1 antibody drugs are highly specificity and
versatile in the treatment of infectious diseases their working
principle involves the host immune system the time used to
develop antibody therapeutics are usually considerably shorter
than that used to develop a vaccine many sars-cov-2 antibody
drugs are isolated from patient blood and target the s proteins
although there many binding sites on the s protein that
antibodies can target the ones that are most effective in
neutralizing sars-cov-2 block the receptor-binding domain rbd
of the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2
receptor the rbd is a dongle-shape protein at the end of the
viruss spikes as mentioned above there are many
mutations on the s proteins the rbd is also prone to mutations
some mutations that break hydrogen bonds andor salt bridges in
antibodyantigen interactions will have a large impact
however silent mutations such as those that replace
hydrophobic residues with other hydrophobic residues will
typically have little effect to avoid the failure of one
specific antibody the cocktail treatments that include several
different antibodies might be required to treat sars-cov-2 that
undergoes antigenic mutations the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein or s protein comprised of
two subunits s1 and s2 of very different
properties25 see figure 5 among
them the s1 subunit as shown in figure
5 contains the
receptor-binding domain rbd responsible for binding to
the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
ace2 the rbd is also the common binding domain for
antibodies the s2 subunit offers the structural support
of the s protein and mediates fusion between the viral and
host cell membranes after the fusion the virus releases
the viral genome into the host cell the s1 rbd protein plays key parts in the induction of
neutralizing-antibody and t-cell responses as well as
protective immunity however s2 and extracellular domain
ecd of spike protein and their combination are commonly
used in recombinant proteins in sars-cov-2 antibody
development as shown in table 5
the s protein is the most heterogeneous structural protein
with a significant number of mutations as shown in figures 5 and
6 and table 6 the divergence of the spike
protein the nonconserved regions of the spike protein
might contribute to the antigenicity difference in
sars-cov-2 isolates we found that most of the high
frequent mutations of the s protein are located in the s1
subunit figure 6
indicates that near half of the amino acid residues have
had mutations since january 5 2020 one of the important
mutations at s1 is 23010tc v483a within the rbd for
ace2 binding and the total frequency of 23010tc
v483a is 23 the structural study revealed that the
amino acids 442487 in the s1 subunit may impact
viral binding to human ace2926
the mutations identified in this study imply the change in
ace2 binding affinity and the transmissibility of
sars-cov-2 as well as negative impacts in preventive
vaccine and diagnostic test development sars-cov-2 main protease or 3cl protease is essential for
cleaving the polyproteins that are translated from the
viral rna10 it operates at multiple
cleavage sites on the large polyprotein through the
proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins and plays
a pivotal role in viral gene expression and replication
sars-cov-2 main protease is one of the most attractive
targets for anti-cov drug design because its inhibition
would block viral replication and it is unlikely to be
toxic due to no known similar human proteases another
reason for the focused drug discovery efforts in
developing sars-cov-2 main protease inhibitors is that
this protein is relatively conservative as shown in table 5 figure 7 illustrates
the main protease mutation patterns figure 8 further highlights
the inhibitor binding domain bd indeed the main
protease is relatively conservative compared to the spike
protein table 7
lists top 10 mutations and their frequency in our data
set it is interesting to see that many mutations such as
d176d r298r n151n are degenerate ones one possible
explanation is that nondegenerates may be nonsilent and
likely cause unsurvivable disruption to the virus note
that mutation g15s mostly occurs in cluster iv mutation
r298r is restricted to cluster iv some other mutations
such as d248e a266v n151n and t45i are specific to
certain clusters nonetheless some mutations at the bd
shown in figure 8
are worth noting they can undermine the ongoing drug
discovery effort sars-cov-2 papain-like protease plpro is a cysteine
cleavage protein located within the nonstructural protein
3 nsp3 section of the viral genome17
like the main protease plpro activity is required to
cleave the viral polyprotein into functional mature
subunits and thereby contributes to the biogenesis of
the virus replication additionally plpro possesses a
deubiquitinating activity the sars plpro is also a major
therapeutic and diagnostic target as shown in table 5
the sars plpro is prone to mutations figure 9 shows that
mutations are all over the places in plpro table 8 lists the
top 10 mutations in plpro three of these mutations are
degenerate ones note that only two of the top mutations
occurred in cluster ii in contrast cluster i has many
different mutations sars rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp is an enzyme that
catalyzes the synthesis of the sars rna strand
complementarily to the sars-cov-2 rna template and is thus
essential to the replication of sars-cov-2 rna8 as one of the nonstructural proteins
rdrps are located in the early part of orf1b section like
most other rna viruses sars-cov-2 rdrps are considered to
be highly conserved to maintain viral functions and thus
targeted in antiviral drug development as well as
diagnostic tests on the other hand the sars-cov-2 rna
polymerase lacks proofreading capability and thus its
mutations are deemed to happen as shown in table 5 figure 10
illustrates the sars-cov-2 rdrp mutations since january 5
2020 surprisingly there are many mutations in sars-cov-2
rdrp table 9
describes the top 10 mutations as in other cases five of
these mutations are degenerate ones endoribo-nuclease nendou protein is a nidoviral
rnauridylate-specific enzyme that cleaves rna11 it contains a c-terminal catalytic
domain belonging to the nendou family rna processing the
nendou protein is presented among coronaviruses
arteriviruses and toroviruses the many aspects of the
detailed function and activity of sars-cov-2 nendou
protein are yet to be revealed figure 11 depicts
sars-cov-2 nendou protein mutations as in most other
sars-cov-2 proteins mutations have occurred over
different parts table 5 shows that nendou is relatively
conservative table 10 lists the top 10 high-frequency mutations
of the sars-cov-2 nendou protein that occurred in the past
few months four of these mutations are degenerate ones
the frequencies of these mutations range from 153 to 15
note that cluster vi only has one of these mutations the sars-cov-2 envelope e protein is one of
sars-covs four structural proteins as a
transmembrane protein it involves in ion channel activity
and thus facilitates viral assembly budding envelope
formation pathogenesis and release of the virus22 the e protein may not be essential for
viral replication but it is for pathogenesis figure 12
illustrates e protein as a very small pentamer with a few
mutations table 11 shows its top 10 mutations note that the
first four mutations are degenerate ones all other
mutations have relatively low frequencies as shown in
table 5
the sars-cov-2 e protein is very conservative sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid n protein2 is
another structural protein its primary function is to
encapsidate the viral genome to do so it is heavily
phosphorylated or charged and thereby can bind with
rna additionally sars-cov-2 n protein confirms the viral
genome to replicase-transcriptase complex rtc and plays
a crucial role in viral genome encapsulation therefore
it may function completely differently at different stages
of the viral life cycle sars-cov-2 n protein is
considered to be one of the most conservative sars-cov-2
proteins in the literature and is a popular target for
diagnosis of vaccine development3 the
present works shown in table 5 indicate that the sars-cov-2 n
protein is the worst target of any drug vaccine and
diagnostic development figure 13 is the illustration of
sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein mutations using
6vyo as a template table 12 presents
the top 10 mutations of the sars-cov-2 n protein since
january 5 2020 note that only 2 out of the top 10
mutations are degenerate ones which is a significantly
lower ratio than that of other proteins the frequency of
10th mutation is 78 which suggests there are many
mutations associated with these mediate-sized proteins
most top mutations occurred to clusters i iii and iv
clusters v and vi have almost none of the top 10
mutations sars-cov-2 membrane m protein is another structural protein
and plays a central role in viral assembly and viral
particle formation it exists as a dimer in the virion and
has certain geometric shapes to enable certain membrane
curvature and binding to nucleocapsid proteins similar to
other sars-cov proteins m protein is also a popular
target for viral diagnosis and vaccines table 5 gives
sars-cov-2 m protein the middle ranking for its
conservation table 13 details the top 10 mutations in sars-cov-2
m protein that occurred in the past few months eight of
these mutations are degenerate clusters i and v have
relatively a few of these mutations on january 5 2020 the complete genome sequence of sars-cov-2 was first
released on genbank access number nc0455122 by zhangs
group at fudan university28 since then there has
been a rapid accumulation of sars-cov-2 genome sequences in this
work 15 140 complete genome sequences with high coverage of
sars-cov-2 strains from the infected individuals in the world have
been downloaded from the gisaid database20 httpswwwgisaidorg as
of june 1 2020 all the records in gisaid without the exact
submission date were not taken into considerations to rearrange the
15 140 complete genome sequences according to the reference
sars-cov-2 genome multiple sequence alignment msa was carried out
by using clustal omega21 with default
parameters snp genotyping measures the genetic variations between different members
of a species establishing the snp genotyping method for the
investigation of the genotype changes during the transmission and
evolution of sars-cov-2 is of great importance by analyzing the
rearranged genome sequences snp profiles which record all of the snp
positions in teams of the nucleotide changes and its corresponding
positions can be constructed the snp profiles of a given genome of a
covid-19 patient capture all the differences from a complete reference
genome sequence and can be considered as the genotype of the
individual sars-cov-2 the jaccard distance measures dissimilarity between sample sets the
jaccard distance of snp variants is widely employed in the
phylogenetic analysis of human or bacterial genomes30 in this work we utilize the jaccard distance to
compare the difference between the snp variant profiles of sars-cov-2
genomes the jaccard similarity coefficient also known as the jaccard index is
defined as the intersection size divided by the union of two sets
a b121the jaccard distance of two sets
a b is scored as the
difference between one and the jaccard similarity coefficient and is a
metric on the collection of all finite
sets2therefore the genetic distance of
two genomes corresponds to the jaccard distance of their snp variants
if a  b  
a  b and
b  a then we say
these two snp variants are relatives if a 
b then a is the ancestor of
b and b is the descendant of
a in principle the jaccard distance measure of snp variants takes account
of the ordering of snp positions ie transmission trajectory when
an appropriate reference sample is selected however one may fail to
identify the infection pathways from the mutual jaccard distances of
multiple samples in this case the dates of the sample collections
offer useful information additionally clustering techniques such as
k-means described below enable us to
characterize the spread of covid-19 onto the communities suppose we have a total of n snp variants
concerning a reference genome in a sars-cov-2 sample the
location of the mutation sites for each snp variant will be

location-based representation will
be6 hundreds of complete genome sequences are deposited to gisaid every
day which results in an ever-growing massive quantity of high
dimensional data representations for the
k-means clustering for example if the data
set of an organism involves 10 000 snps the initial
representation will be a 10 000-dimensional vector for
each sample which can be computationally difficult for a simple
k-means clustering algorithm therefore
a dimensionality reduction method is used to preprocess the
data the essential idea of pca-based k-means
clustering is to invoke the pca to obtain a reduced-dimensional
representation of each sample before performing the
k-means clustering in practice one can
select a few lowest dimensional principal components as the
k-means input for each sample in ref
5 the authors
proved that the principal components are the continuous solution
of the cluster indicators in the k-means
clustering method which provides us a rigorous mathematical
tool to embed our high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional
pca subspace the rapid global transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has
offered some of the most heterogeneous diverse and challenging mutagenic
environments to stimulate dramatic genetic evolution and response from
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this work
provides the most comprehensive genotyping of sars-cov-2 transmission and
evolution up to date based on 15 140 genome samples and reveals six
clusters of the covid-19 genomes and associated mutations on eight different
sars-cov-2 proteins we introduce mutation h-index and
mutation ratio to qualify individual proteins degree of
nonconservativeness we unveil that sars-cov-2 envelope protein main
protease and endoribonuclease protein are relatively the most conservative
whereas sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein spike protein and papain-like
protease are relatively the most nonconservative we report that all of the
sars-cov-2 proteins have undergone intensive mutations since january 5
2020 and some of these mutations might seriously undermine ongoing efforts
on covid-19 diagnostic testing vaccine development antibody therapeutics

recent years1 2 3 influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine are called variant viruses when they are found in people4 from december 2005 to september 21 2012 326 influenza ah3n2 variant v 14 ah1n1v and 5 ah1n2v cases have been identified5 in september 2012 a 37 year old male ontario resident was diagnosed with influenza a h1n1v infection this was the first detection of this variant influenza strain in an individual in canada the case who has an unknown influenza immunization history had recently traveled within canada during which time he had close contact with swine and to the united states where he had close contact with cattle attendance at swine fairs could not be ascertained at the beginning of september he became ill with gastrointestinal symptoms of unknown etiology followed by acute respiratory symptoms and on september 9 was admitted to a local area hospital with pneumonia following a 2-day admission he was discharged from hospital but was re-admitted on september 13 with worsening respiratory symptoms and subsequently was transferred to a tertiary care center where he required admission to an intensive care unit the case had two separate treatment courses of oseltamivir administered the first course was for five days 75 mg twice daily starting on september 16 2012 he had a second seven-day course of 150 mg twice daily starting on september 21 2012 at time of writing the case had been discharged home following an extended stay in intensive care however additional travel and exposure information was unattainable only one close contact of the case reported symptoms of influenza-like illness ili that person tested negative for influenza phol performs a large proportion of primary respiratory viral testing for the province of ontario from a

oseltamivir and zanamivir complete sequencing analysis of pb1 pb2 pa ha na and m genes on viral rna extracted from the first passage in rhesus monkey kidney cells revealed that all sequences are very similar between 989 and 995 to viruses that have been found in us swine in 2011 and 2012 table 1
 interestingly four of the internal genes pb1 pa np and ns shared the highest homology of 99269964 to aswineillinoisa00857318a2012 a swine triple reassortant h3n2 isolate containing m and np genes of pandemic h1n1 the sequences for aontarion1635782012h1n1v were deposited in the gisaid database under accession numbers epi397237epi397244 pcr and sequencing results of ha and na showed that this virus is an h1n1 subtype which is closely related to h1n1 swine triple reassortant viruses identified in the united states in 2011 and 2012 sequencing revealed that this h1n1 carries the m gene of influenza ah1n1pdm09 as was found in the last 2 documented cases of h1n1v infection in wisconsin december 2011 and missouri reported september 2012 the nucleotide and deduced amino acid aa sequences comparison of the ha gene of aontarion1635782012 revealed 997 nucleotide 100 aa and 971 nucleotide 972 aa homologies to has of the two most recent h1n1v cases in wisconsin and missouri however the ha nucleotide homology was found to be lower at 927 908 aa homology to acalifornia72009 h1n1-like virus the ah1n1pdm09 strain in the current seasonal influenza vaccine table 2
 the even lower nucleotide homology to acalifornia72009 h1n1-like virus na gene 796 is consistent with this virus not being detected by the phol in-house ah1n1pdm09 na gene real-time pcr due to several scattered mismatches in primer and probe binding sites6
 comparison of the ha1 gene of the ontario influenza a h1n1 variant with the reference vaccine strain acalifornia072009 revealed 30 amino acid substitutions including d35n k36r i61l p83s s84n d97n s128t k130r a141t l151i v152a l161i s162n d168n g170e g178a k208r k211e i216t e224a v250a m257l e258k a261s p271s n276d k283n i298v k302e l314m among these substitutions 5 are located in antigenic sites ca a141t d168n g170e and sa l161i s162n convalescent serum collected three weeks after illness onset september 26th 2012 had hemagglutination inhibition hi titers of 20 10 and 40 respectively against reference vaccine strains aperth162009 h3n2 bbrisbane602008 and bwisconsin12010 however it had a very high titer of 5120 against the vaccine strain acalifornia72009 h1n1 antigenicity of the h1n1v isolate was examined using ferret antisera to acalifornia709 by hi assay it cross-reacted with an hi titer of 160 reference hi titer is 640 this serological profile suggests close antigenic homology between ah1n1pdm09 and the h1n1v strain reported here based on the testing results from phol and nml we concluded that this patient was infected with an influenza a h1n1v virus table 3
 based on data from the us centers for disease control and prevention two a h1n1v viruses awisconsin and amissouri isolated from humans in the us in 2011 and 2012 are closely related antigenically to acalifornia72009 virus which is a vaccine component of the currently available influenza vaccine it is expected that the 20122013 seasonal influenza vaccine will confer protection against the a h1n1v influenza virus although the seasonal influenza vaccine may not protect people against some other variant influenza viruses that are very different from currently circulating human influenza viruses this study also confirms occurrence of an a h1n1v infection in canada with a strain that is genetically very closely related to the two recent a h1n1v strains from wisconsin and missouri this suggests a common origin and geographic spread from the united states into canada it also raises the possibility of recent human ah1n1v infections that have gone undetected in the us and canada the demonstrated cross reactivity with the a h1n1pdm09 h1 gene cdc realtime pcr suggests that laboratories that only use the pdm09 ha1 gene pcr to confirm this subtype would incorrectly report this variant as a a h1n1pdm09 subtype unless they were doing further molecular investigations this highlights the need for ongoing influenza surveillance including subtyping strain typing and molecular characterization and the need for a representative selection of influenza viruses to have further molecular investigation by sequencing which would ultimately detect any significant circulation of such variants such infrastructure will also enable rapid detection of more virulent influenza viruses such as highly pathogenic avian influenza a h5n1 we also suggest that a representative sample of influenza viruses from a variety of settings eg critical care outbreak-related community-based be screened by molecular methods in order to detect variants following the emergence of h3n2v infections in the us in 2011 phol does screen a selection of influenza a subtype h3 specimens with the swine np gene pcr to screen for h3n2v however the np gene pcr is positive in influenza a h1n1pdm09 as well as h1n1v as both are of swine origin in general exposure and travel-related information is poorly completed on laboratory requisitions and not consistently asked of patients presenting with influenza-like illness particularly during influenza season hence many variant cases would be missed it is anticipated that finding a variant virus would be very rare thus it is not essential to test all patients for both the ha and na genes of influenza a h1n1pdm09 however systematic sequencing which is primarily conducted in order to detect changes in the influenza genome which could impact vaccine effectiveness could optimize detection of variants this work should be conducted by reference laboratories as part of influenza surveillance there were no external sources of funding for this

respiratory syncytial virus and other respiratory viruses in victoria australia o price h s sullivan g c sutterby j druce k carville s   influenza respiratory syncytial virus rsv and other respiratory viruses are the cause of substantial morbidity and mortality with children under 5 years of age and the elderly disproportionately burdened 1 both influenza and rsv display distinct seasonality however the exact timing and magnitude of their annual epidemics remain difficult to predict 2 a better understanding of the epidemiology of these pathogens is useful for the prevention and control of future epidemics and for optimising clinical management of patients 3 moreover this knowledge may inform prediction models used to estimate the timing and magnitude of influenza epidemics 2 interference between respiratory viruses has been well documented during peaks of influenza epidemics the spread of other respiratory viruses particularly rsv appears to be limited 46 delays in outbreaks of influenza during the 2009 pandemic in europe were linked to the annual rhinovirus epidemic associated with the beginning of the school year 79 in turn the influenza pandemic was observed to interfere with seasonal epidemics of rsv in france 10 and israel 11 rsv and metapneumovirus in germany 12 seasonal influenza in hong kong 13 and all respiratory viruses except rhinovirus in beijing 14 studies investigating viral interference since the pandemic are sparser though two studies reported that the timing and magnitude of respiratory virus epidemics were affected by the timing of the seasonal influenza a peak 15 16 collectively these observations suggest interference may prevent respiratory viruses reaching their epidemic peaks concurrently but also underscore the complexity of these interactions the exact nature of interactions between different respiratory viruses remains unclear although they are proposed to be driven by the innate immune system once a viral infection is established interferon production is believed to confer temporary immunity to neighbouring cells against infection by other respiratory viruses 17 in vitro infection with rsv is blocked by competitive infection of influenza a if the host is not infected with the two viruses simultaneously 18 similarly ferret models have shown that influenza a infection may prevent successive infection with rsv 19 and that coinfection with different influenza subtypes is dependent upon the order in which the viruses infect the host 20 despite this apparent interference viral co-infections do occur albeit with insufficient frequency to maintain an epidemic-level spread of the co-infecting viruses a recent study reported infrequent co-detection of rhinovirus with other viruses 21 despite observations that rhinovirus continues to be shed for several weeks post-resolution of symptoms 22 negative associations have also been observed between the detection of influenza a rsv parainfluenza virus or coronavirus and co-detection of other respiratory viruses 8 23 24 providing further evidence for a refractory period after initial infection during which the host is less likely to be infected by subsequent exposure to another respiratory virus we used routine diagnostic testing data of specimens from both the community and hospitals at the victorian infectious diseases reference laboratory vidrl between 2002 and 2017 to describe relationships between respiratory viruses with a focus on influenza a and rsv from may 2002 to december 2017 58 114 clinical specimens were collected from communities and hospitals and tested by polymerase chain reaction pcr for respiratory virus infection at vidrl there were no inclusion criteria regarding symptoms but it is assumed that testing was deemed clinically relevant multiple specimen types were tested but the majority were nosethroat swabs 642 or nasopharyngeal aspirates 171 the respiratory panel included nine viruses adenovirus influenza a influenza b parainfluenza virus picornavirus virus family includes rhinoviruses and enteroviruses rsv coronavirus from 2010 human metapneumovirus from 2012 and influenza c from 2012 data were de-identified but the date of birth postcode of residence and sex of the patient were provided data exclusions are shown in figure s1 data from outbreaks research and non-victorian residents were excluded n  10 325 as they followed different sampling methods specimens collected from the same patient within 14 days were considered part of the same infection where both specimens were positive for the same virus or both were negative they were counted as one episode where there were both positive and negative results only the positive result was retained and when two specimens were positive for different viruses they were collapsed to represent one episode of co-detection as a result 8612 records were excluded data from 2009 n  4232 were excluded as the influenza pandemic led to changes in referral and testing practices data from 2016 to 2017 n  1293 were also excluded as the introduction of in-house testing at some referring hospitals led to a substantial decrease in samples tested by vidrl demographic data of patients were compared using pearsons 2 test weekly proportions positive for each virus were calculated to allow comparability and assess differences in virus epidemics between seasons we compared our data to influenza notification rates in victoria obtained from the national notifiable diseases surveillance system nndss 25 to assess the representativeness of inter-seasonal peaks we observed to assess timing and magnitude of epidemics the proportion of positive specimens and the peak week of the epidemic were considered those in the lowest quartile were considered early or small and those in the highest quartile were considered late or large seasonality of viruses was assessed visually by time series analysis and for further investigation each virus was compared with influenza a and rsv using cross-correlations that estimated the association between peaks in epidemic curves at a lag or lead of up to 15 weeks fishers exact test was used to investigate any negative association between virus pairs among specimens with co-detections multivariate logistic regression adjusted for age category 5 519 2064 and 65 years sex and season was used to produce odds ratios or and 95 confidence intervals for these associations and the chi-square test used to assess trend adjustment for multiple comparisons was not performed 23 26 the significance level for all tests was set at p  005 all data extraction exclusion and analyses were performed in stata version 142 statacorp college station texas there were 33 652 pcr results from 2002 to 2015 excluding 2009 included in this study of these 11 154 331 were positive for at least one of the nine viruses tested for table 1 picornavirus rhinovirus was detected most frequently n  5363 331 of the positive specimens followed by influenza a n  2259 203 and rsv n  1487 133 the proportion of tests positive for most viruses remained relatively stable fig 1 however there was a higher positivity rate of rsv pre-2009 p  0001 the positivity rate of influenza a peaked and troughed a year with a big epidemic was usually followed by a year with a smaller epidemic of the influenza a-positive samples 579 were ah3n2 237 were ah1n1 and the remaining not subtyped in most seasons one subtype predominated although in 2005 and 2014 the subtypes were observed to circulate with similar magnitude and timing and in 2013 they circulated as two distinct peaks of comparable magnitude the rate of picornavirus detection increased from 2006 to 2010 and then decreased from 2011 to 2015 returning to a level similar to that observed at the beginning of the study period

 more specimens tested were collected from males 539 table 1 as a proportion of total tests per sex females were more likely to test positive for influenza a p  0001 and metapneumovirus p  0015 while males were more likely to test positive for picornavirus p  0003 table s1 there was no significant difference in sex distribution for the other viruses patients residing in rural areas were significantly more likely to have a positive test than those in urban areas p  0001 the same pattern was seen individually for rsv parainfluenza virus and adenovirus however patients from urban areas were more likely to test positive for influenza a and metapneumovirus associations between remaining viruses and area of residence were not significant respiratory virus tests were most frequently requested in winter juneaugust n  11 750 349 table 1 and were most likely to be positive in winter p  0001 six of the nine viruses were most frequently detected in winter but parainfluenza virus and metapneumovirus were most frequent in spring septembernovember and picornavirus was most frequent in autumn marchmay tests positive for picornavirus were distributed relatively evenly across the seasons so although the modal week was in autumn a peak was less distinct compared to other viruses the median age of positive tests was lower than that for all tests 369 iqr 24615 and 453 226643 years respectively as a proportion of total tests per age group children under 5 years had the highest burden of rsv adenovirus picornavirus and parainfluenza virus while those aged 519 years had the highest burden of influenza types a and b and those aged 65 years and older had the greatest burden of metapneumovirus table s1 notably the median age of patients from whom specimens were collected increased fairly steadily from 276 years in 2002 to 61 years in 2015 table s2 time series analysis demonstrated annual seasonal peaks for influenza a and rsv fig 1 peaks occurred most frequently in winter with occasional peaks in late autumn rsv and early spring influenza a although influenza a virus circulation during summer in victoria is expected to be minimal we observed increased influenza positivity rates in many summers during the study period one of which was larger than its preceding winter peak 20132014 these inter-epidemic peaks were reflected in victorian notification rates obtained from nndss in summers from 2010 to 2011 onwards visible as influenza activity not reaching zero as it had in previous summers fig 2 seasonal peaks were also observed among the other viruses except picornavirus although they did not occur every year picornavirus remained endemic throughout the year for the duration of the study period
 cross-correlations were performed to ascertain whether the timing and magnitude of other viruses may differ relative to influenza a activity results revealed a moderate to strong correlation between epidemic curves of influenza and rsv in 9 of 13 years on average where correlated a seasonal epidemic of rsv occurred 6 weeks earlier than that of influenza a table 2 although there were 3 years where the epidemics occurred at similar times 2002 2005 and 2006 as a sensitivity analysis we performed further cross-correlations to assess whether influenza subtype affected these interactions table s3 the lag calculated for influenza a overall was consistently similar to that of the predominant influenza a subtype in a given season in some years the lag calculated suggested influenza ah1n1 circulated prior to rsv however in these years the number of samples positive for influenza ah1n1 was 10
 no consistent pattern emerged when considering timing and magnitude of influenza a and rsv seasons table 2 an early epidemic of one virus sometimes resulted in a later than usual epidemic of the other but this was not always the case likewise a season with a high magnitude of infections with one virus did not necessarily result in a season with a low magnitude of the other generally influenza b epidemics occurred at a similar time to influenza a and in years that influenza a circulated early 2002 2005 2011 2012 influenza b activity was low data not shown co-detections of respiratory viruses occurred in 64 n  823 of positive samples exploratory data analysis using univariate logistic regression suggested co-detections were more likely to occur in children under 5 years males and during winter odds of co-detection decreased as age increased using the 5 year age group as the reference category the ors adjusted for sex and season and corresponding 95 confidence intervals for co-infection were 037 027052 for those aged 519 years 027 023033 for those aged 2064 years and 019 015025 for those aged 65 years p-value for trend   0001 co-detections occurred most frequently with adenovirus 40 influenza c 39 and coronavirus 20 though the number of influenza c infections was small n  18 fig 3 co-detections were rarest with picornavirus 10 and influenza a and b 6 infections analysis of co-infections using fishers exact test found a pattern of a negative association between detection of influenza a rsv or picornavirus and co-detection of another virus table 3 these three viruses were involved in the highest number of significant negative associations n  5 table 3 no positive associations between viruses were considered statistically significant multivariate logistic regression adjusted for age group sex and season was used to further investigate the probability of co-detection given infection with influenza a rsv and picornavirus table 4 significant negative associations were observed for co-detection with all viruses where influenza a was detected and all but one virus for rsv and picornavirus detections influenza b and human metapneumovirus respectively


 we used multi-year routine pcr testing data to establish patterns of respiratory virus circulation in victoria australia picornavirus rhinovirus was most frequently detected children aged 5 years and those living in rural areas experienced a high burden of infection time series analyses indicated the annual occurrence of epidemics for influenza a and rsv and less recurrent epidemics for influenza b coronavirus and parainfluenza virus picornavirus was observed to be endemic throughout the period of analysis rsv epidemics generally began in autumn and peaked early winter while influenza a began mid-winter and peaked late winter the higher incidence of rsv observed pre-2009 may be a result of the higher proportion of children under 5 years in our sample pre-2009 as rsv is considered the most important respiratory illness-causing pathogen in infants 27 we observed summer peaks of influenza a in some years which was somewhat unexpected in a temperate climate but was only reflected in state-wide notification data after 2009 it is possible that inter-epidemic peaks we observed are a result of denominator data while the increase in notifications resulted from a rise in testing after the 2009 pandemic 28 in years that epidemics occurred influenza b coronavirus and parainfluenza virus peaked in winter and metapneumovirus in spring like previous studies 15 16 time series analyses and cross-correlations established distinct circulation patterns of rsv and influenza a the two viruses rarely reached their epidemic peak concurrently with rsv peaking an average of 6 weeks before influenza a influenza a subtype did not affect cross-correlations in seasons where significant correlation was observed the lag calculated for influenza a overall was similar to that of the predominant subtype in some seasons influenza ah1n1 appeared to circulate prior to rsv however in these seasons the number of ah1n1 positive samples was 10 so the results should be interpreted with caution an investigation into seasonal relationships between epidemic curves of other viruses was limited by the small proportion of positive tests the endemic nature of picornavirus appeared to be unaffected by the circulation of other respiratory viruses which supports previous observations of rhinovirus activity most common species of picornavirus 15 16 this may be a result of increased stability of the non-enveloped picornavirus during warmer months compared to other viruses like influenza which are restricted by temperature and humidity 29 we also investigated the distribution and incidence of respiratory virus co-detection improved availability and sensitivity of diagnostic tests has resulted in more regular detection of co-infections 30 though the impact of viral co-infection on clinical severity remains unclear 31 32 a prospective household transmission study during the 2009 influenza pandemic reported that the infection wave caused by influenza ah1n1pdm09 was interrupted by a wave of non-influenza respiratory virus infections 33 it found individuals infected with influenza ah1n1pdm09 were less likely to be infected by non-influenza respiratory viruses than non-infected individuals rr 032 further there was a significant decrease in the duration of viral shedding in co-infections of any respiratory viruses compared to single infections these observations suggest that such interactions may modulate influenza attack rate during outbreaks thus shaping the epidemic and highlighting the importance of better understanding co-infections in the context of viral interference we found co-detections of respiratory viruses in 64 of positive specimens which falls in the 50620 range of previous studies 31 like other studies we found co-infection was less likely with increasing age 34 35 which may be a consequence of pre-existing immunity or decreased viral shedding with increasing age 30 we found adenovirus and coronavirus most likely to be part of a co-infection and influenza a and b least likely corroborating results of a previous study 36 while our data did not include patients symptoms immunological 37 and clinical 24 38 data suggest that the effect of co-infection on clinical severity depends on the specific pathogens co-infecting the patient infection by rhinovirus may result in temporary immunity of the host to infection by other respiratory viruses due to the production of cytokines 17 thus resulting in a negative association between rhinovirus infection and co-infection with another virus 23 moreover it is believed to be the driver of epidemiological interaction between respiratory viruses at the population level which is visible when two viruses may not reach their epidemic peak during the same period while rhinovirus has been the focus of other studies investigating co-detection we found that influenza a rsv and picornavirus all had significant negative associations with co-detection of other viruses results of further investigation by logistic regression adjusted for covariates that are predictors of codetection sex age and season were compatible with influenza a rsv and picornavirus conferring temporary immunity against infection by another respiratory virus however we cannot make causal inferences from the design used and therefore cannot eliminate the role of other environmental factors our study has some limitations all inferences we made and indeed the majority of inferences made in other studies investigating respiratory virus interference are based on ecological data with such data we cannot determine whether events observed are the result of a biological mechanism nor can we infer the direction of the postulated interaction ie which virus impacts which to make any form of causal inference a prospective study that serially samples participants over multiple respiratory virus epidemics would be required furthermore we did not adjust for other potential drivers of viral interference such as environmental eg temperature humidity social and behavioural factors also we cannot rule out the possibility that our observations were the result of surveillance artefacts that is changes in testing patterns that are not a result of genuine fluctuations in viral circulation while we excluded specimens isolated from outbreaks or for surveillance and samples from 2009 and 20162017 when testing patterns were obviously altered we cannot be certain we controlled completely for this unknown typesubtype data for other viruses may have also improved the resolution of our findings as other studies have noted variances in the timing of epidemics caused by different types of parainfluenza virus 4 6 and rhinovirus 21 and there is scant information available for rsv additionally our study sample was drawn from patients ill enough to seek healthcare as some viruses such as picornavirus are more likely to result in asymptomatic infection than others the distribution of viruses in our sample may differ from that in the population finally the referral base of paediatric samples for vidrl is limited as most victorian paediatric samples are forwarded to a childrens hospital given there is a high burden of respiratory virus infection in children this may have limited our analyses a strength of our data is that it spanned 16 years accurately monitoring seasonal variation in respiratory virus epidemics has the potential to improve our understanding of interaction and interference between different respiratory viruses although this remains challenging as surveillance systems for non-influenza respiratory viruses are limited in both scope and funding our study confirms the existence of temporal relationships in the circulation of some respiratory viruses in victoria and provides further evidence to support the postulated effects of viral interference on magnitude and timing of respiratory virus epidemics  vereflu an integrated multiplex rt-pcr

deng ian barr natalie caldwell kian-leong ong mitsuharu sato rosemary tan raymond lin   influenza type a viruses are classified by the antigenic properties of their surface glycoproteins into 16 hemagglutinin ha and 9 neuraminidase na subtypes 1 influenza b viruses are not subtyped historically only three ha subtypes h1 h2 and h3 have been responsible for pandemic outbreaks this includes the 2009 outbreak caused by a novel influenza a h1n1 virus of swine origin 2 in contrast all virus subtypes and combinatorial possibilities of ha and na have been detected in wild birds and poultry 3 since 1997 highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai viruses in particular the h5n1 subtype have jumped the species barrier and caused ongoing sporadic fatal outbreaks in humans 4 therefore the looming threat of pandemics from influenza viruses cannot be overlooked and assays that enable rapid accurate identification and subtyping of influenza viruses is pertinent for surveillance and outbreak management the increasing popularity of chip-based dna microarrays reflects their tremendous diagnostic potential and utility for rapid detection and subtyping of influenza viruses 511 of late a

 the vereflu assay was tested with a panel of 9 non-influenza viruses 3 different influenza a virus subtypes h1n1 h3n2 h5n1 and influenza b virus no cross-reaction was observed with the influenza viruses tested with the non-influenza respiratory viruses cross-reactions were noted for the 2009 pandemic influenza capture probe with human coronavirus oc43 and influenza b capture probes with human adenovirus type 7 these were considered minor cross-reactions as their probe signal-to-noise ratios were weakly positive also in both cases only one of the triplicate samples was positive hence the overall analytical specificity for the vereflu assay was calculated to be 96 the vereflu assay was validated at three sites in singapore using a total of 277 respiratory samples table 3 the assay showed good sensitivity 91 and excellent specificity 100 for all the influenza viruses tested
 the system was evaluated using clinical and cell-cultured virus samples additionally avian influenza a h5n1 virus testing was also performed overall out of the 44 samples tested the vereflu assay results for 40 specimens 91 were concordant with the reference methods all n  4 influenza-negative samples tested negative specifically the vereflu assay detected the influenza viruses in positive samples as follows 1012 833 for pandemic h1n1 33 100 for seasonal h1n1 22 100 for h5n1 79 777 for h3n2 and 1818 100 for influenza b observations by the research investigators indicated that the assay was able to detect both lineages of influenza b viruses yamagata and victoria lineages and influenza a viruses of different clades including h5n1 the reproducibility of the vereflu assay is presented in table 4 when tested at rna copy numbers that would give moderate and strong positives for h3n2 and influenza b the assays were highly reproducible 91 as expected when low rna copy numbers were tested the reproducibility dropped to almost 50 for h3n2 and 70 for influenza b
 here we report the development and evaluation of a portable and easy-to-use diagnostic platform the vereflu assay for the typing and subtyping of human influenza virus the test is based on an on-chip multiplex rt-pcr amplification followed by detection using a microarray and it can be performed fairly rapidly taking about 3 h to complete each tcs or thermal reactor accommodates a maximum of five chips which can be run either simultaneously or independently using different protocols the modular nature of the system allows the linkup of more than one tcs unit to the computer hence enabling the system to be adapted to the throughput needs of either large- or small-scale diagnostic settings laboratory reproducibility data from our study suggest that the assay is easy to handle which is an important consideration during outbreak situations the overall clinical sensitivity for all influenza a viruses tested was 943 and the specificity was 968 these values were comparable to those obtained in similar microarray based influenza virus typing assays 18 19 it is known that microarray-based detection and typing of influenza viruses is generally less sensitive than performing a real-time pcr 9 19 our analytical sensitivity was determined to be 102 copiesreaction for each influenza type these figures are similar to those reported by huang et al 9 at 102 rna copiesreaction for seasonal h3n2 h1n1 h5n1 and influenza b virus the detection limit for a multiplex pcr assay has been reported to be 50 copies for influenza a and influenza b viruses 20 which explains why some of the samples that were typed and confirmed by the reference methods of cell culture and real-time rt pcr were missed by the vereflu assay in our laboratory we use real-time pcr to detect influenza a virus and then follow up with a second subtyping pcr when influenza a positives are detected we anticipate that the vereflu assay will ease that process since detection and subtyping is done simultaneously on-chip multiplexing capabilities of real-time pcr reactions are typically limited to a fourplex as restricted by the number of fluorescence acquisition channels present in the pcr instrument in contrast the detection format in the vereflu assay is low-density-array-based allowing tens to hundreds of capture probes to be spotted and correspondingly allowing a similar number of amplicons to be detected hence the arrays have a much greater detection capability for robust parallel testing than real-time pcr given the high mutational frequency of influenza virus genomes 21 efforts taken to increase the specificity of the vereflu assay included the use of short capture probes of 21 to 28 nucleotides 22 as well as the incorporation of probe redundancy the capture probes were designed to detect between 2 and 4 sections of the targeted gene and may be useful in overcoming the problem of misdiagnosis due to capture probes failing to hybridize with the amplicon as a result of gene polymorphisms in our assay capture probe cross-reactions were observed for the 2009 pandemic influenza a h1n1 probe with human coronavirus oc43 and the influenza b capture probe with human adenovirus type 7 during the testing of clinical samples false positives of this nature will be unlikely as hybridization to only one capture probe instead of both probes for influenza b virus or all three probes for 2009 pandemic h1n1 is insufficient to permit the vereflu software to call a positive result instead the operator will be alerted that the particular influenza gene segment has been detected and a re-test will be advised we are working on applying a more stringent hybridization wash which may solve the problem of cross-reactions in summary we have developed a lab-on-chip device that has been clinically evaluated both locally and at who melbourne the system was found to be reliable and accurate for the identification of clinically significant influenza viruses and could potentially prove to be a valuable method for routine influenza surveillance as well as outbreak events  plagues and adaptation lessons from the felidae models for sars and aids stephen obrien j jennifer troyer l melody roelke laurie marker jill pecon-slattery   it is becoming increasingly clear that understanding the components of disease processes particularly infectious disease will be critical for understanding the survival or demise of free ranging mammalian species genomic variation of both host species and infectious agent is of critical importance in the outcome of a disease outbreak and even more so in endangered species species with reduced genetic variation particularly in genes involved with disease resistance may be less able to mount an effective immune response against an emerging pathogen representing carnivores the cat family felidae offers numerous examples of reduced genetic variation in natural populations common to endangered species including asian lion panthera leo persica gilbert et al 1991 cheetah acinonyx jubatus menotti-raymond and obrien 1993 tiger p tigris luo et al 2004 leopard p pardus uphyrkina et al 2001 uphyrkina et al 2002 and the north american populations of puma puma concolor culver et al 2000 roelke et al 1993 that may signify increased susceptibility to opportunistic infectious disease in addition the pathogens themselves evolve constantly developing new genetic based strategies to overcome or abrogate the immune defenses of the host species the consequence of the co-evolution of pathogen and host are a dynamic ratchet of constantly improving virulence of the agent and resistance of the host both the pathogens and the host are survivors of ancient deadly struggles and the exquisite strategies that have been retained are only now being deciphered conservation management of endangered carnivores has limited opportunities to detect monitor and contain emergent pathogens due to logistic concerns involved with the continued monitoring of the health status of natural populations as a result we know most about disease processes in humans homo sapiens garrett 1994 so understanding humanpathogen interactions can help us correctly interpret examples from wildlife there are far more people and more human medical researchers than there are for most large charismatic mammals so more human disease outbreaks have been tracked tools of molecular biology genetics immunology and epidemiology were developed with human disease in mind but they work very well in other mammals thus efforts in characterizing the genetics evolution and pattern of transmission of pathogens and the resultant conservation implications for the host species benefit directly from advances in human genomic research one of the most significant advances in the genomics era integral to conservation genetics is the whole genome sequence of a score of mammals starting with human mouse rat and chimp these projects now capture the phylogenetic divergence across all the orders of placental mammals by inclusion of dog cat elephant cow and others nhgri website wwwgenomegov further a subset of orthologous genes sequenced in representatives of 5400 species determined conclusively the evolutionary pattern of divergence of placental mammals during the last 105 my murphy et al 2001a murphy et al 2004 murphy et al 2001b obrien et al 1999a the utility of the mammalian phylogeny in conservation ranges from defining taxonomic units to using the evolutionary tree as a reference guide to detect patterns of mutation adaptation and selection in endangered species for example whole genome sequences of human chimpanzee pan troglodytes mouse mus musculus and dog canis familiaris indicate that not only do genomes evolve at different rates cooper et al 2004 but also categories of genes experience different regimes of selection to either diversify or maintain function among primates rodents and carnivores in addition human and chimpanzee separated by only 57 my of evolution enard and paabo 2004 exhibit profound differences in chromosome recombination winckler et al 2005 gene expression hill and walsh 2005 and differential selection for biological function clark et al 2003 further adaptive evolution of genes involved with the immune response to infectious disease can be estimated only by comparison across species for example the major histocompatibility complex mhc is a large multi-gene complex responsible for adaptive immune response in mammals and is integral to host resistance to emerging pathogens kumanovics et al 2003 whole genome sequence of mhc reveals differences in gene composition gene order and putative gene function between primates rodents and carnivores belov et al 2004 kumanovics et al 2003 yuhki et al 2003 thus conservation genetic strategies for targeting informative genes benefit from a wealth of sequence data defining unique differences for these gene families among taxonomic groups our ongoing research into hostpathogen interactions in the cat family felidae offers additional insights on how the application of molecular genomic technologies to non-human animal species not traditionally studied in research laboratories holds real promise in conservation there are 38 species of felids nearly all of which are listed as threatened or near threatened with extinction wwwiucnredlistorg recently we have defined the pattern of divergence of the eight major lineages of cats from a common origin in asia and a series of global migration events over the past 10 my johnson et al 2006 fig 1
 which provides an important evolutionary context for the analysis of hostpathogen adaptation in the following we illustrate how our investigations into the genomic evolutionary and population studies of endangered cats species reviewed in obrien and johnson 2005 uncovered feline disease that resembled those in human and vice versa the first involves the sars epidemic that devastated human populations in east asia in 2003 and a parallel outbreak in the cheetah a jubatus years before pearks wilkerson et al 2004 the second focuses on the lentivirus genus which a generation ago korber et al 2000 leapt from chimpanzee to humans-likely through the bush meat trade in western africa hahn et al 2000 sharp et al 1999 sharp et al 2005 and precipitated perhaps the most deadly scourge in recorded history hivaids  the cat family felidae is afflicted with a close relative of hiv feline immunodeficiency virus fiv in domestic cat felis catus fiv infection results in disease progression and outcome similarly to that of hiv in humans and offers a natural model to aids bendinelli et al 1995 here we compare and contrast fiv genetics among additional cat species to yield new perspectives on hostpathogen adaptation the impact of emerging pathogens in felids in these cases provides a cautionary tale of the importance of disease outbreaks in free-ranging species the unpredictable nature of these outbreaks argues for conservation management strategies to guard against the introduction of disease by domestic animals or introduction of infected individuals into nave populations however these cases show how in humans rapid genetic and genomic characterization of both pathogen and host has been effective in development of treatment intervention and therapy and offers a paradigm for disease research in conservation of endangered species sars severe acute respiratory syndrome first appeared as a flu-like disease caused by a new human coronavirus in guangdong province in southern china drazen 2003 drosten et al 2003 holmes 2003 in the space of nine months the virus traveled to 29 countries infected over 8000 people and caused nearly 800 deaths cdc 2004 the virus spread with alarming speed among health care workers through casual contacts and across the globe causing human suffering and huge economic costs published reports indicate a virus phylogenetically close to the sars virus was discovered in samples collected in chinese food markets from himalayan palm civets paguma lavarta guan et al 2003 further screening of wildlife has now identified one or more species of bat as the presumptive host reservoir for sars-like coronaviruses sl-cov lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 poon et al 2005 the epidemic subsided by may 2003 presumably consequent of draconian quarantine measures there is still little clear understanding of the precise mode of transmission and while there are promising advances in research of sars protease inhibitors savarino 2005 wei et al 2006 there is still no vaccine or efficacious treatment for infected patients the sars outbreak caught many by surprise since human coronaviruses are well known as the cause of one third of common colds and are rarely deadly further veterinary virologists have commonly studied coronaviruses in livestock dogs cats and poultry and find these viruses seldom cause fatal diseases holmes 2003 however exceptions have occurred for example in pigs where a single nucleotide variant of porcine coronavirus leads to virulent pathogenic enteric coronavirus ballesteros et al 1997 sanchez et al 1999 the second exception involved a devastating feline coronavirus outbreak in cheetahs a jubatus documented in a wild animal park wildlife safari in rural winston oregon heeney et al 1990 obrien et al 1985 wildlife safari was then the most prolific a jubatus breeding facility in the world holding some 60 cheetahs in may 1982 two young cheetahs arrived from the sacramento zoo in california and rapidly developed symptoms of fever severe diarrhea jaundice and neurological spasms both died and were diagnosed at necropsy with the wet form of feline infectious peritonitis fip a disease caused by feline coronavirus in domestic cats heeney et al 1990 within six months every cheetah in the park developed antibodies to the fip virus fipv and exhibited diarrhea jaundice weight loss gingivitis and renal and hepatic pathology fig 2
 within two years 60 of the cheetahs had died of fip evermann et al 1988 heeney et al 1990 to our knowledge this was the worst outbreak of fip in any cat species in reported domestic cat outbreaks mortality seldom exceeds 5 foley et al 1997 the winston fip outbreak preceded pcr and advanced molecular phylogenetic methods but when sars appeared in 2003 archival specimens were revisited to characterize the nature of the cheetah coronavirus pearks wilkerson et al 2004 sequences of three viral genes from five cheetahs were pcr amplified phylogenetic analyses of the cheetah strains and other known coronaviruses placed the cheetah fipv within the monophyletic group i lineage as close relatives of domestic cat fipv porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and canine coronavirus ccov fig 3
a furthermore the polyphyletic arrangement of the cheetah strains interspersed with domestic cat fipv suggested few differences between the deadly cheetah virus and the more innocuous domestic cat virus fig 3b given the high genetic similarity between domestic cat fipv and cheetah fipv and the fact that several lions p leo at winston park became infected with the virus simultaneously but did not succumb to fip we suggested the reason for the extremely high morbidity and mortality was due to host genetics the cheetah is one of the most genetically homogeneous species within the cat family the cheetah has as its closest relatives two north and south american species of puma p concolor and jaguarondi p yagouaroundi and together form the puma lineage fig 1 fossil records indicate that cheetah once had a nearly global distribution compared with its current distribution of sub-saharan africa and a relict population in iran nowell and jackson 1996 a series of genetic studies of cheetah populations describe a species depauperate in genomic variation and this loss in genetic heterogeneity was most likely due to a severe population bottleneck that felled scores of large mammal species in north america europe asia and australia 1000012000 years ago driscoll et al 2002 menotti-raymond and obrien 1993 obrien et al 1987 the near extirpation led to generations of close inbreeding during the cheetahs ancestry reducing overall genomic diversity 10100-fold menotti-raymond and obrien 1993 this reduction included variation in the immune response genes within the major histocompatibility complex obrien et al 1985 obrien and yuhki 1999b yuhki and obrien 1990 the genetic basis for disease resistance is that inherent population genetic diversity provides a broad moving target for evolving pathogens thus when a microbe evolves a strategy to abrogate immune defenses of an individual the genetically diverse population may still be protected however once virulence was achieved in the first cheetah the conditions were set for transmission pathogenesis and morbidity in the other individuals within the population made vulnerable by shared genetic and immunologic homogeneity the parallels and lessons for sars have relevance to conservation of biodiversity in wildlife first the deadly coronaviruses in both human and cheetah represent profound consequences that may accompany viral emergence into a new host phylogenetic analyses of genetic data clearly define the domestic cat origin of cheetah fipv fig 3a b and that the virus appeared to be highly pathogenic upon entering the new host the similarity of the pattern of high pathogenicity with sars infection of humans suggests that the virus is potentially more benign in the reservoir species of bats albeit this remains unconfirmed lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 even so the pattern of genetic changes within the pathogen among the intermediate host of palm civet p lavarta was very similar to those observed in human strains and is consistent with the expectation of rapid evolution in the pathogen to adapt to the new host immune response song et al 2005 second while mortality in humans with sars symptoms cdc 2004 and in house cats with fipv foley et al 1997 was low 10 in humans 5 in cats infected cheetahs exhibited the opposite extreme with 90 morbidity and over 60 mortality fig 2 as for cheetahs the combined evidence suggests that genetic uniformity makes epidemics much worse it is likely that variation in immune defense genes of humans and domestic cats protected them from a deadly disease to which most exposed and genetically impoverished cheetahs succumbed fig 2 thus genomic characterization of both pathogen and host are key for conservation of biodiversity and prevention of disease outbreak lastly fipv in cheetahs and sars in humans are highly contagious spreading rapidly in close quarters in weeks if not days fig 2 shaw 2006 this inherent ability of emergent pathogens to rapidly infect endangered populations should be an integral consideration for management strategies of re-introduction aids had first appeared in humans in the early 1980s as a clustering of patients from homosexual communities in los angeles and new york city with a rare cancer kaposis sarcoma and pneumonia aids is caused by a lentivirus a genus within the family retroviridae termed human immunodeficiency virus or hiv that infects and destroys cd4-bearing t-cells there are two forms of hiv types 1 and 2 and since its recognition in the early 1980s hiv-1 has spread across the globe infecting 65 million people and killing over 22 million wwwunaidsorg aids is potentially the most deadly disease in recorded history because it is a disease with no vaccine and a treatment that slows the virus but does not clear it from sequestered cellular reservoirs and has infected 65 million and continues to infect new cohorts within the world populations rathbun et al 2006 wwwunaidsorg the origin of the ongoing hiv-1 pandemic is recent and the virus entered humans early in the 20th century originating from a subspecies of chimpanzee p troglodytes troglodytes in central west africa gao et al 1999 wild chimpanzees are infected with sivcpz simian immunodeficiency virus and genetic study affirms this strain is the closest genetic relative to hiv gao et al 1999 additional evolutionary studies indicated these cross-species transmission events occurred more than once between chimpanzee and human to form hiv-1 subtypes m n and o gao et al 1999 and at least once between sooty mangabey cercocebus atys and humans to form hiv-2 gao et al 1992 in total primate lentiviruses infect at least 23 species and like sivcpz are host-specific hahn et al 2000 sharp et al 1999 sharp et al 2005 all naturally occurring siv are in african primates and these species seem resistant to aids-like pathology by contrast asian species are nave and do develop aids when infected with the siv from african primates hirsch 2004 the sole naturally occurring model for aids disease in humans is the feline homologue of hiv feline immunodeficiency virus fiv although related lentiviruses are found in other species such as sheep and goats caprine arthritis encephalitis virus  caev horse equine infectious anemia virus  eiav and cattle bovine immunodeficiency virus  biv only fiv in domestic cats causes aids-like disease fiv was first discovered in 1986 in a house cat with a wasting-like disease pedersen et al 1987 currently fiv is epidemic among feral domestic cats throughout the world and is associated with an aids-like syndrome of immune depletion increased susceptibility to rare cancers and opportunistic disease and death bendinelli et al 1995 willett et al 1997 fiv has a small viral rna genome of about 9000 nucleotides that is similar in sequence gene content and gene arrangement to that of hiv-1 miyazawa et al 1994 as with primate lentiviruses fiv naturally infects multiple species of cat in the wild western blot screening of antibodies against fiv in free-ranging non-domestic cat species fig 4
 revealed that several were exposed to the virus carpenter and obrien 1995 olmsted et al 1989 olmsted et al 1992 troyer et al 2005 a recent comprehensive survey of serum and lymphocyte specimens from 3055 individuals within 35 felidae and 3 hyenidae species used three fiv antigens isolated from domestic cat lion and puma as targets of western blot plus pcr-based fiv genome sequence amplification as a validation of fiv infection troyer et al 2005 those results revealed that at least 11 free ranging felidae species harbor fiv antibodies and fiv viral genomes fig 4 these species are distributed across africa including lion leopard p pardus and cheetah along with two hyenidae species of spotted hyena crocuta crocuta and striped hyena hyaena hyaena fiv positive species occur in north and south america including puma jaguaroundi p onca jaguarondi ocelot leopardus pardalis margay l weidii geoffroys cat l geoffroyi tigrina l tigrina and in asia with pallas cat otocolobus manul eight other species had western blot signals of antibodies but did not yield fiv sequences using multiple pcr primers which is likely due to divergence within the primer binding sites exceedingly low proviral load or both fig 4 overall inclusion of fiv western blot results from captive individuals indicates that as many as 31 species of cat are susceptible to fiv infection and may harbor species specific viruses or be infected with non-native virus troyer et al 2005 fig 4 further the distribution of fiv is not uniform among cat species being endemic in africa and north and south america but rare in species from europe and asia fig 4 phylogenetic analyses of the pol-rt region 476 bp isolated in felidae species reveal the sequences form species-specific monophyletic clades fig 5
 this monophyletic pattern suggests that fiv does not spread among species easily rather fiv infected an ancestor of each host and then evolved within that species there have been exceptions to this finding but only in captive animals and these occur rarely for example the captive snow leopard p uncia fiv sequence is well within the african lion fiv clade a fig 5 another example is a captive puma infected with a domestic cat strain of fiv carpenter et al 1996 however in the wild opportunities for inter-species transmission are limited and thus the virus becomes adapted to its particular host this evolutionary pattern resembles that of naturally occurring siv in african primates where siv forms monophyletic lineages that are specific to each species allan et al 1991 sharp et al 2005 and are host-dependent yet fiv transmission may have a geographic component whereby species in close proximity share more similar fiv strains this is suggested in the common node shared by leopard fiv and cheetah fiv fig 5 clinical consequences for fiv infection in most non-domestic felidae species is not known and there has been little convincing acute disease or patterned disease symptoms associated with fiv infection as is observed consistently for domestic cats only one example of fiv-related mortality has been documented in a species other than domestic cat a captive lion poli et al 1995 the lack of documentation of clinical signs of fiv infection in wild populations may reflect logistic obstacles and expenses in routine physicals for these species alternatively these species-specific fiv strains may have undergone a prolonged period of co-adaptation with their respective host and may be less pathogenic as a consequence carpenter et al 1996 carpenter and obrien 1995 in the following study with lions we describe how current conservation efforts with endangered cat species are integrating genetic studies of fiv in natural populations natural populations of african lions represent one of the longest running studies of fiv infected felids in the wild brown et al 1994 troyer et al 2004 a western blot survey of lions throughout africa fig 6
 indicates fiv antibody seroprevalence can range from 0 in namibia and kalahari to 94 in the serengeti in tanzania and kruger park in south africa this eastwest discordance in fiv seroprevalence may be a consequence of geographic barriers such as the kalahari desert however it is not clear whether these geographic differences in fiv prevalence most were sampled only once reflect an ongoing spread or a stable restriction of fiv spread in the low incidence regions phylogenetic analysis of fiv rt-pol sequences in lions reveal the persistence of at least six principal viral clades or subtypes af represented in different populations of lions in africa some are unique to certain populations eg subtype e in botswana subtype c in the serengeti and subtype f in kenya while others are present in multiple populations fig 7
 the genetic distances among these lion fiv subtypes are as great as the distance observed between fiv isolates from different cat species fig 5 fig 7 this level of separation would suggest that the clades evolved in isolation the common monophyletic node uniting all lion fiv strains suggests that fiv infected a common ancestor early in lion population history the virus subtypes then evolved in isolation with specific lion populations as observed with subtypes c d and e in the case of subtype a and b it is likely that these evolved in formerly geographically isolated lion populations that recently came together allowing the transmission of the virus subtypes currently observed because there is little known of disease associations with fiv infection in lions it is difficult to know whether there are now or ever were virulence distinctions among the clades one of the most detailed lion population studies is that of the serengeti in tanzania this large panmictic population over 3000 individuals has provided many useful insights into lion pride structure population dynamics and transmission of infectious diseases gilbert et al 1991 hofmann-lehmann et al 1996 muller-graf et al 1999 munson et al 1996 packer et al 2005 long-term surveillance of lions in the serengeti has not revealed any evidence of aids like illnesses decreased viability or decreased fecundity in this population where seroprevalence among adult lions is 100 these observations of relatively benign infection are similar to those for fiv in north american puma biek et al 2006 biek et al 2003 and consistent with the notion that fiv has persisted in these host species longer than in domestic cat and that significant host adaptation has already occurred carpenter et al 1996 carpenter and obrien 1995 however recently we have shown that lions infected with fiv have significantly lower cd4 counts than uninfected animals suggesting that there may be sub-clinical immunological effects associated with fiv-infection in this population roelke et al in press at one stage we also suspected that infection with one clade of fiv might be a natural vaccine against infection with another or the mutational occurrence of a virulent deadly fiv variant carpenter and obrien 1995 however troyer et al 2004 inspected the pattern of fiv subtype distribution among 13 serengeti lion prides and discovered multiple clade infections ie two or three subtypes of virus present in the same lion in 43 of the infected lions an observation that would argue against acquired immunity by infection with a single strain in 1994 the serengeti lions became the target of a deadly infectious disease outbreak that caused whisker twitches neurological seizures and death to over 1000 lions a third of the population fiv was excluded as the primary cause since several afflicted lions were fiv negative roelke-parker et al 1996 the etiological agent was a hyper-virulent form of a canine distemper virus cdv a virus previously known to infect but seldom cause morbidity in felidae species roelke-parker et al 1996 this time in the most deadly reported outbreak of the cdv among african carnivore species a virulent transmissible cdv variant spread from domestic dogs living around the serengeti park to hyena bat eared foxes otocyon megalotis and to lions carpenter et al 1998 although fiv was not the primary explanation for the 1994 serengeti lion mortality it may have played a supporting role hiv infection in humans causes increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections of normally benign infectious agents like hhv8kaposis sarcoma pneumocystis carnii pneumonia or cytomegalovirus as a consequence of cd4 t-lymphocyte depletion and immune collapse levy 1993 nearly all the lions in the serengeti carried fiv and fiv has been shown to be associated with depleted cd4-lymphocyte counts of 200 cellsl compared with counts of 8001000 cellsl in uninfected individuals roelke et al in press one could speculate that adult lions may have done better in defending against cdv had they not been afflicted with lentivirus that depletes their principal defense against viruses the cd4 lymphocyte population while there were fiv-negative animals that died these were all juveniles roelke-parker et al 1996 and it is possible that their immature immune system may have accounted for their susceptibility to the new virus the african lion study provides some useful insights on the impact of infectious disease in endangered populations development of detection methods and effective monitoring of the health of animals in the wild is problematic and as in the case of the cdv outbreak was documented only due to the presence of researchers already in place to collect samples and observe the final outcome although this cdv outbreak was marked by relatively high mortality estimates roelke-parker et al 1996 subsequent outbreaks were less virulent packer et al 1999 within the same population until we fully understand the immunological effects of infection with prevalent fiv strains the interaction of pathogens such as cdv and fiv and the role of the host immune system in modulating these viral infections the question of their importance and collaborations in pathogenesis will continue one approach is to continue to adapt and apply new technologies developed from human biomedical research to conservation of wildlife for example the massive research effort into understanding hiv in humans offers new technologies to apply towards related viruses such as fiv in endangered cat species recognition that fiv causes aids-like disease in domestic cat and that this is a natural model for hiv in humans has led to extensive surveillance of fiv in other species biek et al 2006 biek et al 2003 carpenter et al 1996 carpenter and obrien 1995 olmsted et al 1992 troyer et al 2004 troyer et al 2005 an essential step in determining the genetic diversity of the pathogen knowledge of key amino acid motifs in the env gene of hiv linked with evading host immune surveillance wyatt and sodroski 1998 yusim et al 2002 is in turn targets for comparative genomic research of virulence in fiv de parseval et al 2006 understanding how genetic diversity within mhc in humans is linked with either resistance to hiv or increased susceptibility carrington and obrien 2003 provides an incentive to sequence mhc in multiple mammalian taxa including cats yuhki et al 2003 yuhki and obrien 1990 the links between hiv in humans and fiv in endangered cat species illustrate the utility of biomedical approaches and discoveries that is directly applicable to elucidating the role of disease in endangered species we are just now beginning to understand the complex interplay of host genetic background immune competence and pathogen evolution that contribute to the course of an epidemic when a disease agent enters a new species or population the advances in molecular biology immunology and genetics provide a diverse collection of effective tools for unraveling the secrets to survival as the tools that are used in human medicine become available to wildlife research new approaches and understanding of disease outbreaks and effective host control of infection are increasingly possible unfortunately in wildlife populations few disease outbreaks are followed from start to finish and the vast majority remain completely unobserved and undocumented but see randall et al on ethiopian wolves and other papers in this special edition for this reason our understanding of the effects of population demographics genetics mating and migration patterns on the spread of and ultimately clearance of andor adaptation to disease is limited these examples of fipv and fiv illustrate a critical need for consistent programs designed to monitor and survey endangered populations conservation strategies that incorporate biological sampling yield invaluable genetic profiles of disease and disease resistance within endangered species genomic analyses provide insight into the history of a population and its pathogens that can assist in documenting patterns of co-evolution and adaptation yet these examples underscore the unpredictable aspects of epidemics within natural populations of threatened or endangered species and there is need for much more comprehensive and long-term data finally conservation management would clearly benefit from a better knowledge of viral evolution adaptation and cross-species infections to plan protected areas inform strategies of re-introduction and relocation and provide effective interventions in cases of potential disease epidemics by resolving the root causes of human and animal outbreaks and their outcomes we shall

reduction in hospital stays 30 reduction in the inappropriate use of antibiotics and 20 reduction in unnecessary diagnostic tests and procedures 9 multiplexed molecular assays that can concurrently detect multiple pathogens from the same sample in a single reaction have been increasingly adopted in clinical microbiology laboratories in the recent years 10 several studies have shown that these molecular tests have superior diagnostic capacity and cost-effectiveness of molecular tests when compared to conventional and other diagnostic methods 11 12 for influenza viruses rapid molecular tests based on polymerase chain reaction pcr using primers that target the relatively conserved matrix m gene are frequently used for achieving rapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis however variations in the gene and amino acid sequences in different influenza virus subtypes due to rapid mutations of the viral rna polymerase may affect the results of these tests with the emergence of human infections due to the swine-origin influenza a h3n2 variant h3n2v virus in north america in 2010 and more recently the avian-origin influenza a h7n9 and h5n6 in china 1315 it would be important to ascertain the analytical sensitivities of these rapid tests for the novel influenza viruses 16 17 in a previous study we have demonstrated that xtag rvp has lower sensitivity for detection of h7n9 in patient samples and culture isolates 16 17 nxtag respiratory pathogen panel rpp ce-ivd luminex molecular diagnostics toronto canada is a recent new qualitative multiplex molecular test for the detection of

all 133 specimens were evaluated by nxtag rpp overall 153 pathogens were identified by nxtag rpp ten positives h1pdm09  1 rsv a  1 p1f1  1 adenovirus  1 evrhinovirus  4 and bocavirus  2 were considered as false positives when compared with positive reference the sensitivity specificity positive predictive value and negative predictive value of nxtag rpp for detection of respiratory viruses were 952 95 confidence level cl 904977 996 95 cl 993998 935 95 cl 884965 and 997 95 cl 994999 respectively table 2 of 133 tested samples 71 had enough quantity to be used for further testing with xtag rvp and filmarray rp the results of these 71 samples tested by the three assays were then compared out of these 71 specimens 66 were positive and 5 were negative by nxtag rpp both the xtag rvp and filmarray rp detected respiratory pathogens in 63 887 specimens with 96 and 83 pathogens respectively the sensitivity specificity positive predictive value and negative predictive value of xtag rvp and filmarray rp were 969 999 990 and 997 and 853 999 988 and 989 respectively when nxtag rpp was compared with xtag rvp and filmarray rp the kappa value was 097 with 95 ci of 095099 and 093 with 95 ci of 089097 respectively when xtag rvp was compared with filmarray rp the kappa value was 095 with 95 ci of 091098 these results suggested that the three assays were highly concordant as a kappa value higher than 080 indicated concordance we have previously shown that xtag rvp has low sensitivity for detecting h7n9 16 17 in this study one of the patient specimens with confirmed h7n9 influenza a infection was also not detected by xtag rvp influenza a but was detected by nxtag rpp and filmarray rp influenza a xtag rvp has a 1000 and 10 times higher limit of detection for h7n9 than nxtag rpp and filmarray rp respectively table 3 these findings show that nxtag rrp has greatly improved the sensitivity for detecting h7n9 over the xtag rvp besides nxtag rpp has also improved sensitivity for detecting other respiratory viruses over xtag rvp 1 adenovirus and 2 bocavirus these findings corroborate another recent report on the partial comparison between the nxtag respiratory pathogen panel assay and the luminex xtag respiratory panel fast assay v2 32 nxtag rpp detected 12 more pathogens than filmarray rp in our study with 50 612 being enterovirusrhinovirus the other additional positives detected by nxtag rpp were adenovirus 2 parainfluenza virus 4b 1 hmpv 1 h1n1pdm 1 and m pneumoniae 1 overall 8 positives hmpv 1 p2 1 p4 3 enterovirusrhinovirus 2 and m pneumoniae 1 were not detected by nxtag rpp all these positives indeed had high ct value 35 that may be lower than the limit of detection by nxtag rpp further study should be required if the primers that are suspected do not detect epidemic strains furthermore the results of 5 samples 4 h1n1pdm 2009 and 1 h7n9 were reported to be equivocal by filmarray rp flu a-pan-1 positive flu a-pan-2 negative these 5 specimens were in fact true positive as confirmed by other testing methods these findings indicated that m gene flu a-pan-1 was more sensitive than ns1 gene flu a-pan-2 for detection of h1n1pdm 2009 when influenza a virus subtype isolates were tested the mean range analytic sensitivities viral load log10 copiesml and tcid50ml of nxtag rpp xtag rvp and filmarray rp were 30 1842 and 07 0005632 43 3064 and 418 056178 and 34 2744 and 08 01178 respectively table 3 all avian- and swine-origin influenza a strains were detected by m gene in nxtag rpp xtag rvp and filmarray rp the swine-origin h1n1pdm09 was correctly genotyped by nxtag rpp and filmarray rp however h3n2v and seasonal h3n2 could not be differentiated by nxtag rpp in the recent years the availability of molecular diagnostic tests has revolutionized the diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases and treatment of rtis multiplexed molecular assays simultaneously detect multiple pathogens from the same sample in a single reaction vessel providing a more comprehensive picture of infection in this study the clinical performance of the luminex nxtag rpp cv-ivd in npa specimens was found to have high sensitivity 952 and specificity 996 for detection of respiratory viruses these findings are similar to those reported in recent evaluation studies using nxtag rpp ruo kit by other groups 1820 the performances of the nxtag rpp xtag rvp and filmarray rp were also compared their results were highly concordant with the highest concordance reported between nxtag rrp and xtag rvp kappa value  097 95 cl 095099 according to the manufacturer m gene flu a-pan-1 and ns1 gene flu a-pan-2 are used for influenza a typing by filmarray rp the result is only interpreted as positive when both genes are positive the result will be interpreted as equivocal when only flu a-pan-1 is positive and the system will suggest the users to repeat testing by the same assay or other assays in this study the results showed that an equivocal result by filmarray rp is most likely to be a true positive the correct interpretation of these results should be considered to avoid delay in diagnosis and treatment particularly in patients with severe influenza a virus infection in general the analytical sensitivities of the nxtag rpp and filmarray rp for the swine- and avian-origin influenza viruses were comparable but xtag rvp had more than one log lower analytical sensitivity than nxtag rpp and filmarray rp table 3 nxtag rpp also had higher analytical sensitivity for detecting h5n6 than the xtag rvp but the same sensitivity as filmarray rp and higher analytical sensitivity for detecting h3n2v than xtag rvp and filmarray rp all three multiplex assays accurately typed and genotyped the influenza viruses except for nxtag rrp that does not distinguish subtyped h3n2 from h3n2v this finding was further confirmed by testing another h3n2v strain aindiana082011 with 500tcid50 a recent study also showed that nxtag rpp ruo only correctly genotyped 955 of influenza a virus h1n1pdm09 strains 19 rapid multiplex rt-pcr assays for respiratory pathogens detection are important for establishing diagnosis to facilitate the implementation of appropriate treatment and infection control measures sensitive and specific laboratory diagnosis of all influenza a virus subtypes is especially essential in certain epidemic regions such as southeast asia the correct interpretation of these results is also important and would avoid delay in patient management and infection control especially in patients with severe seasonal influenza a or avianswine-origin influenza a virus subtype infection clinical microbiologists infectious disease specialists and laboratory managers should be aware of and understand the different clinical performances of these commercially available molecular multiplex rt-pcr assays that are commonly adopted in many clinical microbiology laboratories the sensitivity and specificity of these molecular multiplex assays must be predetermined and be able to confidently detect most of the important avian or swine influenza a subtype infection including h5n1 and h7n9 and this capability is particularly important for use in southeast asia a limitation of this study is that some target numbers are small this is due to low prevalent disease and may require a longer period in order to collect a higher number of positives high cost for these multiplex assays is another limitation for us to study more samples in this study the results showed that nxtag rpp xtag rvp and filmarray rp assays had high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of respiratory diseases they are suitable for use in clinical diagnostic laboratories for detection of respiratory pathogens in patients with rtis however awareness should be raised that h3n2 could not be distinguished from h3n2v by nxtag rpp further investigation should be performed if h3n2v is suspected to be the cause of disease  the prevalance of respiratory viruses among healthcare workers serving pilgrims in makkah during the 2009 influenza a h1n1 pandemic ziad memish a abdullah assiri m mohammed alshehri raheela hussain ibrahim alomar   healthcare workers are exposed to many respiratory infections when they see patients and they may transmit these infections to their patients or colleagues for example during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 attack rates were more than 50 in healthcare workers1 healthcare workers who see pilgrims during hajj the annual muslim pilgrimage to makkah may be at higher risk of acquiring respiratory and other infections2 3 because of these risks special immunization requirements have been proposed to protect healthcare workers4 although healthcare workers have not been included in previous studies of respiratory diseases during hajj2 5
 hajj is the largest annual mass gathering in the world it brings more than two million people from different countries together in a small confined area the extreme overcrowding of pilgrims during hajj reaches about 7 persons per meter combined with fatigue and extremely hot weather during much of the year this crowding may increase the risk of transmitting air- and droplet-borne infectious diseases particularly respiratory viruses3 5 6 7 an estimated one in three pilgrims experience respiratory symptoms6 several transmissible bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens have been reported among pilgrims notably meningococci of all serotypes streptococcus pneumoniae gram-negative organisms atypical organisms mycobacterium tuberculosis influenza a and b viruses rhinoviruses respiratory syncytial virus rsv parainfluenza viruses enteroviruses and adenoviruses5 6 8 9 10
 in april of 2009 a novel influenza a strain h1n1 2009 strain in mexico spread globally11 12 the toll was particularly heavy in saudi arabia which ranked fourth of 22 countries in the eastern mediterranean region in deaths and probable h1n1 cases13 the 2009 hajj took place in november six months later and presented a public health challenge for infection control authorities in saudi arabia14 several practices to minimize disease transmission among pilgrims and healthcare workers were instituted even before the beginning of hajj season since pre-hajj data showed low acceptance rates of h1n1 vaccine among healthcare workers15 16 this study evaluated the prevalence of viral respiratory pathogens among healthcare workers during the 2009 hajj which coincided with the influenza a h1n1 2009 pandemic healthcare workers including physicians nurses health inspectors and others who served pilgrims during the 2009 hajj season were included three-fourths of the healthcare workers in the study were from the saudi ministry of health moh and the rest were from medical missions other than moh most of the healthcare workers had treated pilgrims previously and had been practicing medicine for more than 10 years the main religious activities of the 2009 hajj season started on 25th november 2009 with a visit to the holy kaaba and continued for 5 or 6 days at different holy sites in mina arafat and muzdalifa the current study was a cross-sectional study performed in two phases the first phase was conducted during the week before the start of hajj on november 25th and the second phase was conducted in the week following the end of hajj on november 30th healthcare workers were asked to answer a questionnaire and provide nasal and throat swabs both before and after hajj the pre-hajj questionnaire was about demographics age sex occupation and nationality medical history chronic disease and smoking vaccination history including h1n1 and seasonal influenza and knowledge of h1n1 influenza symptoms transmission and prevention the post-hajj questionnaire included questions about exposure to infections during hajj and compliance with infection control practices hand hygiene cough etiquette and wearing a mask nasal and throat swabs were collected using the same method during both phases of the study nose and throat swabs were collected in viral transport media using dacron swabs on stainless steel wire and plastic shafts respectively remel microtest m4rt usa immediately after collection samples were transported to the jeddah regional laboratory where they were stored at 80 c until tested nucleic acid was extracted using the x-tractor gene corbett from qiagen using 25101 vx dnarna purification protocol the multiplex pcr using micro fluid arrays and

paired statistics mcnemar test differences in the prevalence of respiratory viruses between potential confounding groups such as wearing a mask or getting a vaccine were examined using chi-square or fisher exact test as appropriate all p-values were two-tailed p-value 005 was considered significant spss release 170 spss inc chicago us software was used for all statistical analyses a total of 184 healthcare workers who treated pilgrims during the 2009 hajj season were included in the study of these 161 answered the main pre-hajj questionnaire and 104 answered the short post-hajj questionnaire a total of 120 combined nasal and throat swabs were obtained during the pre- and post-hajj periods demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample are shown in table 1
 the majority of the healthcare workers were males 85 with an average age of 409  92 years range 2359 years non-saudi 71 physicians 75 with more than 10 years of medical experience 60 as well as previous experience of serving in hajj medical services 83 most of the healthcare workers 93 described their own health as very good to excellent chronic disease namely hypertension diabetes and asthma were present in 15 and 11 were current smokers compliance of healthcare workers with pre-hajj vaccination and infection control is shown in table 2
 eighty four percent of them got at least one vaccine before hajj the coverage of hepatitis b meningococcal and seasonal influenza vaccines were relatively high 73 67 and 51 respectively while the coverage of h1n1 vaccine was considerably low 22 the main reasons described for not getting the vaccine were worries about the side effects 42 non-availability 34 and fear of developing h1n1 symptoms 22 approximately 50 of the healthcare workers did not get seasonal influenza vaccine in the past year due to the belief of being healthy 29 lack of knowledge about the place to get the vaccine 22 and the assumption that influenza is not a serious illness 18 compliance with hand hygiene was noted in 98 cough etiquette in 89 and wearing face mask in 90 of the healthcare workers the exposure risk as defined by being within 1 m from a person with ili was reported in 61 handling biological specimens in 34 and examining patients in 76 about 20 of them got sick or injured during hajj background knowledge of the healthcare workers about h1n1 2009 is shown in table 3 table 4
 eighty five percent believed that h1n1 is a serious disease 80 were worried about catching h1n1 influenza during hajj and 75 were aware of the main symptoms of h1n1 influenza the main source or vehicle of h1n1 transmission as recognized by them were contact with people infected with h1n1 86 contaminated fomites 72 and air 65 appreciable level of knowledge about measures to avoid h1n1 infection were noted as described by maintenance of hand hygiene 91 wearing a mask 76 coughsneeze etiquette 76 staying away from sick people 65 using hand sanitizer 63 avoiding crowdspublic gatherings 62 and taking h1n1 vaccine 58 among the 18 circulating respiratory virus types and subtypes only two were detected in the healthcare workers in the pre- and post-hajj period rhinovirus n  21 126 and coronavirus 229e n  1 06 rhinovirus was detected more before the hajj n  14 117 than after n  9 75 but the difference was not statistically significant the only isolate of coronavirus was detected in the post-hajj period two healthcare workers had rhinovirus detected both before and after the hajj rhinovirus was detected in 211 of those who had respiratory symptoms and 300 of those who got sick during hajj no other respiratory viruses were detected in any of the samples the prevalence per 100 persons of respiratory viruses according to age sex profession smoking vaccine sickness and wearing a mask is shown in fig 1
 the prevalence was slightly higher in healthcare workers who got sick during hajj in nurses and in those who did not wear masks than in smokers however the difference was not statistically significant hajj the annual pilgrimage of muslims is a time of a unique mass gathering event in makkah around two million people are confined to small area and the chances of having infections acquired by respiratory tract are increased al-tamami et al10 during the 2001 hajj found 23 cases of meningitis of all types mainly in indians whose ages ranged from 1 to 70 years and in twice as many women as men balkhy et al6 in 2004 studied 500 symptomatic pilgrims 108 of whom had positive viral cultures of these influenza b accounted for 50 followed by herpes simplex virus 214 rsv 129 parainfluenza 74 and influenza a 56 a comparative study of respiratory tract infections in symptomatic uk and saudi pilgrims by rashid et al in 20088 found infections in 25 of uk pilgrims but in only 13 of saudi pilgrims half of the infections in uk pilgrims were due to rhinoviruses followed by influenza virus parainfluenza and rsv the saudi pilgrims had higher infection rates with influenza virus 785 than with rhinovirus 214 in 2009 alborzi et al9 also reported that 325 of patients tested had viral pathogens influenza in 25 98 parainfluenza in 19 74 rhinovirus in 15 59 adenovirus in 14 54 enterovirus in 5 2 and rsv in 4 16 and coinfection with two viruses in 1 patient 04 the current study evaluated the prevalence of respiratory viruses in healthcare workers who saw pilgrims after the h1n1 2009 pandemic had been declared we tested for 18 respiratory virus types and subtypes in the healthcare workers and found primarily rhinoviruses and a single coronavirus 229e rhinoviruses were more prevalent after the hajj 117 than before 75 none of the healthcare workers tested positive for any influenza virus including the h1n1 2009 pandemic strain this is explained by the fact that among more than two million pilgrims in 2009 the ministry of health reported only 100 cases of h1n1 and 5 deaths17 the high case-fatality ratio may be because pilgrims were committed to completing hajj and delayed seeking medical care until their condition had worsened17 18 since the overall number of cases among pilgrims was low therefore the chances of transmitting it to healthcare workers were very small rhinoviruses are present in about two-thirds of persons with common colds and probably are responsible for more human infections than any other agents19 20 they are common in all age groups occur throughout the year and are present worldwide21 louis et al22 found that rhinovirus was responsible for half of the respiratory infections in residents and staff in a long-term care facility for elderly persons although in community-dwelling elderly they cause 63 of respiratory infections23 renois et al24 found rhinoviruses to be most prevalent in cases of influenza-like illness in infections with one agent 25 as well as in co-infections with influenza a h1n1 viruses 50 our finding that rhinoviruses are the most prevalent viruses in healthcare workers during the 2009 hajj are consistent with the other studies of rhinoviruses in the general population in patients with influenza-like illness and also in pilgrims arruda et al25 studied the natural history of rhinovirus infections in adults during autumn and found that among 346 persons with colds 82 283 had rhinovirus infections and 8 had coronavirus oc43 and 229e these findings agree with our finding of rhinovirus as the predominantly isolated virus 126 followed by coronavirus 229e 06 in a group of subjectively healthy healthcare workers arruda et al isolated a high percentage of viruses because the subjects were symptomatic while in our study rhinovirus was detected in 21 of participants with respiratory symptoms and in 30 who got sick during hajj rhinoviruses spread efficiently in families in school groups among university students and on military bases26 27 linde et al28 found an increase in the proportion and number of rhinovirus diagnoses that roughly parallels a decrease in influenza diagnoses after the summer holidays and start of schools they hypothesize that a rhinovirus epidemic could interfere with the spread of pandemic influenza in a warm and humid climate which decreases the spread of influenza by aerosol a similar phenomenon may be responsible for the frequent isolation of rhinoviruses in the present study rhinoviruses may protect the host from being infected by other viruses such as influenza a virus parainfluenza virus adenoviruses coronaviruses bocavirus metapneumovirus and rsv29
 rhinovirus shedding is commonly limited to 1014 days in immunocompetent subjects24 however viral rna may be present from days before symptoms occur to five or more weeks after they go away30 31
 the influenza a h1n1 vaccination rate in healthcare workers has been reported to be lower than the seasonal influenza vaccination rate16 32 33 and was 22 versus 51 in the current study these results are also comparable to the data obtained from the united states for the same period where vaccination coverage for h1n1 in healthcare workers was 37 and for seasonal influenza it was 6232 33
 in conclusion we found that rhinoviruses were the most frequently isolated viruses in a group of subjectively healthy middle-aged healthcare workers who treated hajj pilgrims during the 2009 influenza a h1n1 pandemic respiratory symptoms were present in 21 of the healthcare workers in which the virus was detected none of the participants had influenza a h1n1 2009 despite that only 22 of them were vaccinated against h1n1 vaccine possibly because it was also infrequently found among pilgrims none declared  analysis of serologic cross-reactivity between common human coronaviruses and sars-cov-2 using coronavirus antigen microarray saahir khan rie nakajima aarti jain rafael de assis ramiro al jasinskas joshua obiero m oluwasanmi adenaiye sheldon tai filbert hong donald milton k huw davies philip felgner l   the 2019 novel coronavirus strain sars-cov-2 originating in wuhan china has become a worldwide pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality estimates up to 2 of confirmed cases the current case definition for confirmed covid-19 due to sarscov-2 infection relies on pcr-positive nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens with testing largely determined by presence of fever or respiratory symptoms in an individual at high epidemiologic risk however this case definition likely underestimates the prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection as individuals who develop subclinical infection that does not produce fever or respiratory symptoms are unlikely to be tested and testing by pcr of nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens is unlikely to be 100 sensitive in detecting subclinical infection widespread testing within the united states is also severely limited by the lack of available testing kits and testing capacity limitations of available public and private laboratories therefore the true prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection is currently unknown and the sensitivity of pcr to detect infection is also unknown serology can play an important role in defining both the prevalence of and sensitivity of pcr for sars-cov-2 infection particularly for subclinical infection this point is demonstrated by analogy with influenza virus for which a meta-analysis of available literature measured the fraction of asymptomatic infections detected by pcr as approximately 16 while the fraction of asymptomatic infections detected by seroconversion was measured as approximately 751 the seroprevalence of common human coronaviruses is known to increase throughout childhood to near 100 by adolescence2 thus any serologic methodology to estimate prevalence of sars-cov-2 needs to identify and rule out cross-reactivity with these common human coronavirus strains one challenge in applying serology to sars-cov-2 is that the choice of antigen and choice of assay is less well defined for coronavirus than more well studied viruses such as influenza however prior approaches to serologic detection of infection with emerging coronaviruses including sars and mers have focused on the s1 domain of the spike s glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid n protein which are considered the immunodominant antigens for these viruses3 in particular the s1 domain is strain-specific while the n protein shows cross-reactivity across strains the assay methodologies used for serologic detection of coronavirus infection include binding and neutralization assays these methodologies have been shown to be well correlated4 however neutralization assays require viral culture which must be performed in high-level biosafety containment units for emerging coronaviruses with high epidemic potential such as sars-cov-2 conversely binding assays such as elisa can be readily performed with widely available reagents and equipment so are field deployable and suitable for point of care testing the protein microarray methodology has been widely used to simultaneously perform binding assays against hundreds of antigens printed onto a nitrocellulose-coated slide for detection of multiple antibody isotypes5 this methodology was recently demonstrated for simultaneous measurement of igg and iga antibodies against over 250 antigens from diverse strains and subtypes of influenza6 this methodology has previously been applied to detect antibodies against the s1 domains of sars and mers coronaviruses7 the blood specimens used in this study were collected for a larger study where residents of a college resident community in an eastern university were monitored prospectively to identify acute respiratory infection ari cases using questionnaires and rt-qpcr so as to characterize contagious phenotypes including social connections built environment and immunologic phenotypes8 from among de-identified blood specimens for which future research use authorization was obtained five specimens that showed high igg reactivity against human coronaviruses in the larger study were chosen for validation of the coronavirus antigen microarray the coronavirus antigen microarray used in this investigation includes 67 antigens across subtypes expressed in either baculovirus or hek-293 cells see tables 13 these antigens were provided by sino biological inc wayne pa as either catalog products or service products the antigens were printed onto microarrays probed with human sera and analyzed as previously described figure 16910 briefly lyophilized antigens were reconstituted to a concentration of 01 mgml in phosphate-buffered saline pbs with 0001 tween-20 t-pbs and then printed onto nitrocellulose-coated slides from grace bio labs gbl bend or using an omnigrid 100 microarray printer genemachines the microarray slides were probed with human sera diluted 1100 in 1x gvs fast blocking buffer fischer scientific overnight at 4c washed with t-tbs buffer 20 mm tris-hcl 150 mm nacl 005 tween-20 in ddh2o adjusted to ph 75 and filtered 3 times for 5 minutes each labeled with secondary antibodies to human igg conjugated to quantum dot fluorophore for 2 hours at room temperature and then washed with t-tbs 3 times for 5 minutes each and dried the slides were imaged using arraycam imager grace bio labs bend or to measure background-subtracted median spot fluorescence non-specific binding of secondary antibodies was subtracted using saline control mean fluorescence of the 4 replicate spots for each antigen was used for analysis descriptive statistics were used to summarize the igg reactivity as measured by mean fluorescence across antigen replicates t-test or f-test were used to test for the mean differences in continuous variables across infection groups all statistical analyses were conducted using r version 351 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria overall the 5 sera tested on the coronavirus antigen microarray all showed high igg seroreactivity to antigens from common human coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses with known seasonal circulation versus low igg seroreactivity to antigens from epidemic viruses that were not circulating at time of collection figure 2 specifically 4 of the 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity across the 4 common human coronaviruses while all of the sera showed low igg seroreactivity to sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov all 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to rsv and parainfluenza viruses while 3 of the 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to adenoviruses for influenza all 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to h1n1 and h3n2 influenza a and influenza b strains but low igg seroreactivity to h5n1 and h7n9 influenza a strains with respect to specific antigens the s1 domain of the spike protein including the receptor-binding domain rbd demonstrates very low cross-reactivity between epidemic coronaviruses and common human coronaviruses whereas the s2 domain of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein np show low-level cross-reactivity between these coronavirus subtypes similarly the head domain of influenza hemagglutinin ha1 is not cross-reactive between seasonal and avian influenza strains whereas the stalk domain ha2 is cross-reactive between influenza virus subgroups as seen between h1n1 and h5n1 influenza viruses this pilot study yields several insights into cross-reactivity of common human coronavirus antibodies for sars-cov-2 antigens the antibodies to the s1 and rbd domains of spike protein are highly subtype-specific consistent with the high variability in these sequences between different human coronaviruses conversely the s2 domain of spike protein and np protein are more cross-reactive consistent with these sequences being highly conserved across coronaviruses sars-cov-2 has caused a worldwide pandemic despite likely pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies to s2 domain and np protein in most people indicating that these antibodies are likely not protective whereas antibodies to s1 and rbd domains are more likely to be protective this observation favors a vaccination strategy based on s1 or rbd domains of spike protein over a vaccination strategy that also includes s2 domain or np protein in addition s1 and rbd domains are more likely to generate subtype-specific serologic tests for population surveillance studies in addition a key unexplained finding during the sars-cov-2 epidemic has been the low incidence of infection in children aged 15 and younger this observation generates two related hypotheses adults may have pre-existing antibodies against antigenically distinct coronaviruses that produce an ineffective humoral response to sars-cov-2 infection antibody-dependent enhancement as demonstrated for dengue virus or children younger than 15 may have initially encountered a coronavirus that is more closely related to sars-cov-2 so are more protected against this infection immunologic imprinting or original antigenic sin as demonstrated for influenza virus both of these hypotheses would be informed by comparing the level of cross-reactive coronavirus antibodies in pediatric and adult cohorts and correlating these antibodies with incidence of severe disease a coronavirus antigen microarray has been constructed with antigens from epidemic coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 and common human coronaviruses in addition to other common respiratory viruses a pilot study of 5 nave human sera shows high igg seroreactivity to common human coronaviruses but low igg seroreactivity to sars-cov-2 with some cross-reactivity seen for s2 domain of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein further studies are needed including with sars-cov-2 convalescent sera to fully realize the potential of this novel methodology to characterize the seroprevalence of sars-cov-2 and the impact of pre-existing cross-reactive

binomial or categorical variables the fisher exact test was used to compare differences between binomial variables continuous variables were compared by the kruskal-wallis test and post hoc tests were performed using the dunn multiple comparisons test associations between hmpv-positive rates and climate factors were explored by univariate regression analysis based on the pearson correlation coefficient independent associations were analyzed by the multiple linear regression model using the stepwise selection method a p value 05 was considered a significant difference we also utilized principal components analysis pca to determine the contribution of climate variables to hmpv infections using pca we could reduce high-dimensional data spaces 1 axis per meteorological variable to 2-dimensional planes for further analysis 16 17 based on the results of pca we could select dominant climate factors that affect hmpv infections and 2-dimensional density plots were generated to evaluate the impact of climate factors in hmpv infections during the study period 23 694 patients were subjected to molecular testing for respiratory viruses and 13 871 patients 585 were positive for at least 1 respiratory virus including the following 3631 cases of rhinovirus 153 3482 rsv 147 2652 adenovirus 112 1842 piv 78 1275 hmpv 54 1223 influenza a 52 1017 enterovirus 43 719 influenza b 30 703 bocavirus 30 and 539 coronavirus 23 the rate of positivity and weekly distribution of hmpv infections are shown in figure 1a these rates for hmpv infections varied from 0 to 211 across the weeks significant increases in isolation rates occurred between 10 and 25 weeks and half of the hmpv infections occurred between 13 and 20 weeks april and may of the hmpv-positive specimens 1199 940 were subtyped as follows 570 447 hmpv a2a 304 238 hmpv b1 279 219 hmpv b2 21 16 hmpv a2b and 24 19 mixed-genotype infections only 1 patient was infected with hmpv a1 01 among mixed-genotype infections 12 were hmpv a2ab1 infections 9 were hmpv a2ab2 and 3 were hmpv a2ab2 specimens from 76 patients could not be genotyped not determined the dominant hmpv genotype in peak season was hmpv a2a and the relative frequencies of hmpv b1 and b2 increased in the winter season figure 1b however the annual predominance patterns across the study period were complex and unpredictable figure 1c the clinical characteristics of hmpv infections in pediatric and adult patients are summarized in tables 1 and 2 the majority of patients with hmpv were children 12001275 941 further clinical manifestations were similar between the pediatric and adult patient groups most individuals infected with this virus exhibited upper respiratory symptoms such as cough fever sputum and rhinorrhea and the median onset of symptoms was 3 days in both groups pneumonia was the most common clinical diagnosis associated with hmpv infections for the pediatric group all hospitalized patients showed good prognosis and the median length of hospitalization was 5 days however a mortality rate of 93 was observed in the adult patient group most clinical characteristics were not significantly different between hmpv subtypes in the pediatric group however there were significant differences among hmpv subtypes and clinical manifestations cough seizure abdominal pain and rhonchi and concurrent infections m pneumoniae adenovirus and enterovirus in terms of hmpv subtype infections there was no significant difference in laboratory findings between children and adults supplementary tables 1 and 2 the meteorological characteristics associated with hmpv infections are shown in table 3 comparing 4 hmpv genotypes the p values associated with the mean temperature minimum temperature maximum temperature ground surface temperature and relative humidity were all 05 specifically the isolation of hmpv genotype a2a occurred more frequently with higher temperatures and wet weather whereas hmpv b2 was frequently isolated with relatively low temperatures and dry environments 
figure 2 shows annual variations in the rates of hmpv positivity and climatic variables the intervals between 13 and 20 weeks are marked with orange boxes and more than half of the infections occurred during these intervals as shown in table 4 diurnal temperature variation wind speed relative humidity atmospheric pressure and sunshine duration were directly correlated with rates of positivity based on univariate regression analyses when the correlations were further analyzed by multivariate regression analysis diurnal temperature variation wind speed and sunshine duration were found to be independent associative factors results of pca of hmpv infection cases indicated that the first principal component could explain 520558 of the total variances supplementary table 3 and supplementary figure 1 the most important contributors to the first principal component were temperature variables including mean minimum maximum and ground surface temperatures the second principal component which was dominated by diurnal temperature variation and relative humidity could explain about 20 of the total variances the third principal component was dominated by wind speed which explained approximately 10 of the total variances from the pca results we could assume that temperature relative humidity and diurnal temperature variation were the significant climatic factors associated with hmpv infections density plots were created to visualize the relationships between climate factors and hmpv infections supplementary figure 2 mean temperature with diurnal temperature variation and relative humidity were selected to generate the density plots most hmpv infections occurred at a temperature interval of 8c22c a diurnal temperature difference between 6c and 14 c and a relative humidity interval of 4060 in our study hmpv was detected in 54 of respiratory specimens and was the fifth most commonly isolated respiratory virus hmpv infections occurred more frequently in children and a seasonal peak was found to be prominent in the spring season these results were consistent with previous reports conducted in south korea 6 18 19 the hmpv subtypes a2a a2b b1 and b2 co-circulated throughout the study period and the annual predominant genotypes were hmpv a2a in 2007 2010 2014 2015 and 2016 b1 in 2011 and 2012 and b2 in 2008 and 2009 hmpv genotype predominance was thus observed both for 1 year and a maximum of 3 consecutive years whereas the predominant genotype changed every 34 years however there were no regular cyclic patterns of predominant hmpv genotypes throughout our study period this circulation complexity was also found in long-term studies from the united states and germany 11 20 in addition we could not find any similarities in annual predominance patterns between our study and other studies conducted in neighboring counties including china and japan 2123 these results suggest that the varying annual predominance of hmpv subtypesgenotypes is a local phenomenon and not synchronized across a wide geographic region 11 the clinical features of hmpv infections in our study were consistent with those described in previous reports 9 21 pediatric patients with hmpv infection showed mild respiratory symptoms before 25 days of hospitalization most inpatient children were diagnosed with pneumonia and stayed in the hospital for 46 days hmpv infections seemed to cause more severe illness in adult patients however it was difficult to draw a conclusion with these results because the proportion of adult patients was too small and more severe cases were more likely to be tested in the adult patient group various studies have focused on the correlation between hmpv subtypes and clinical characteristics in infected patients vicente et al found that the clinical severity of hmpv a infections was higher than that of hmpv b infections 8 matsuzaki et al indicated that laryngitis was more associated with hmpv b1 infections whereas wheezing was more prevalent with hmpv b1 and b2 infections 7 however there were also many reports suggesting that there are no differences in clinical characteristics caused by various hmpv subtypes 9 10 21 in our study according to hmpv subtypes statistical significance was found in terms of symptoms physical examination findings and concurrent infections in pediatric patients however we found that there were no distinct differences in clinical diagnoses clinical outcomes and laboratory findings according to hmpv genotypes these results support the contentions that certain clinical manifestations are different among hmpv genotypes but that there is no significant relationship between the hmpv subtype and disease severity we also attempted to assess the effects of meteorological factors on hmpv infections hmpv activity was affected by temperature variables relative humidity diurnal temperature variation wind speed and sunshine duration among these factors the rate of hmpv positivity was positively correlated with 3 variables including diurnal temperature variation wind speed and sunshine duration our results also showed peaks of hmpv activity at temperatures of approximately 135c and relative humidity of 550 furthermore this activity tended to be associated with increasing diurnal temperature variation wind speed and sunshine duration previous studies conducted in other regions suggested that low temperature is the main driver of hmpv seasonality 11 2426 however based on the results of our study we could not conclude that temperature variables are not linearly correlated with hmpv epidemics because the climate of seoul is characterized by large seasonal temperature differences which are not observed in previously studied countries we hypothesized that hmpv would not be prevalent at low temperatures but would be prevalent at a certain temperature interval in addition the amount of rainfall was found to be correlated with the incidence of hmpv infections in subtropical and tropical regions 2729 whereas hmpv activity was not affected by rainfall in our study these findings suggest that hmpv infections were affected by climate factors but that the meteorological drivers of virus activity vary by region and climate group 11 24 we also investigated differences in environmental factors that affect the transmission of each hmpv genotype our study showed that adaptation to climatic conditions with respect to the occurrence of human cases of hmpv subgroups was slightly different for example hmpv b2 infections appeared when the temperature was colder whereas hmpv a2a infections were more prevalent in milder weather with a more humid environment however the origins of these differences in adaptation to meteorological conditions among hmpv subtypes were not clear and further research should be performed to elucidate the link between the transmission abilities of hmpv subgroups and climatic factors although we attempted to minimize errors there were several limitations to this study first 6 of hmpv-positive specimens could not be genotyped due to sample problems such as deficiencies and rna degradation after long-term storage although the proportion of not determined specimens was not relatively large it could have affected the results of our study second the clinical information of hmpv-positive patients was only tracked by medical records due to the nature of our retrospective study we admit that some information could be misrepresented or omitted and this possibility could also affect the results of this study third because respiratory molecular testing was routinely used only for pediatric patients and not for adult patients the study population was biased for pediatric patients and the number of adult patients was relatively insufficient therefore further long-term prospective surveillance should be performed to solve the present limitations and provide more informative results regarding hmpv infections in conclusion our study provides long-term data on hmpv infections from a tertiary hospital serving a south korean population hmpv was the fifth most isolated respiratory virus and patients of various ages were infected mainly between weeks 13 and 20 april and may among the 5 subtypes of hmpv hmpv a2a was most frequently isolated and each hmpv subtype showed annual predominance every 34 years there were also significant differences between hmpv genotypes and clinical characteristics however disease severity was not altered according to hmpv subtype our study also showed that hmpv infections occurred with a seasonal rhythm and were associated with several climate factors including temperature relative humidity diurnal temperature variation wind speed and sunshine duration in addition each hmpv genotype had a different affinity for certain meteorological conditions the results of our study contribute to the understanding of the clinical characteristics of infections caused by each hmpv subtype as well as climate factors that contribute to the transmission of hmpv  diseases associated with bovine viral

rna genome which belongs to the genus pestivirus family flaviviridae and is distributed worldwide 1 bvdv causes significant economic losses to the dairy and beef livestock industries which are attributed to morbidity mortality growth retardation reduced milk production premature culling reduced reproductive performance and increased occurrences of other diseases 2 3 the two currently recognized bvdv species are bvdv-1 and bvdv-2 and they were recently renamed pestivirus a and b respectively 4 5 bvdv-1 is the most genetically diverse with 21 subtypes bvdv-1a through u currently recognized while 4 subtypes ad have been described for bvdv-2 69 more recently the pestivirus hobi-like virus has been proposed as a new bvdv species bvdv-3 or pestivirus h based on antigenic and genetic similarities 4 5 10 11 clinical outcomes of bvdv infection include a transient or acute infection with subclinical respiratory andor severe digestive clinical manifestation characterized by high morbidity and variable mortality and generally associated with noncytopathic ncp viral strains b reproductive infections including oocytesperm infections that negatively affect fertility or

cattle 12 13 as viruses with worldwide distribution 9 bvdv-1 and bvdv-2 have been recognized for many years in south american countries including brazil 14 argentina 15 colombia 16 peru chile 17 and uruguay 18 while the pestivirus hobi-like virus has currently only been identified in argentina 19 and brazil 20 on this subcontinent in uruguay the first evidence of bvdv circulation dates from 1996 21 a serological study revealed that bvdv exposure is widespread in beef cattle throughout uruguay 22 more recently active bvdv infections and circulating species and subtypes were explored in cattle herds with reproductive problems and bvdv-1a was revealed as the predominant speciessubtype followed by bvdv-1i and bvdv-2b 18 clinicopathological descriptions of bvdv-associated diseases in uruguay

typhlocolitis with necrotizing cryptitis with inflammatory infiltrate extended to the submucosa along with fibrinous mesenteric lymphadenitis and moderate multifocal lymphocytic and neutrophilic abomasitis mild diffuse portal lymphocytic histiocytic and neutrophilic hepatitis with cholestasis in the bile ducts and minimal multifocal random necrotizing histiocytic and neutrophilic hepatitis throughout the parenchyma were also observed salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium was isolated from the mesenteric lymph node and intestines while bovine coronavirus and several viruses causing pneumonia were ruled out see online resource 1 bvdv was identified via rt-qpcr ct 2735 from a pool of frozen tissues and characterized as bvdv-2b by sequencing genbank mn159205 ihc for bvdv antigen detection in the lung revealed finely granular homogenous and focal immunolabeling in the cytoplasm of smooth muscle and endothelial cells from an arteriole affected by arteriolitis and infiltrating macrophages fig 2b no immunolabeling occurred in the kidney small intestine colon or liver tissues based on these results we diagnosed septicemic salmonellosis in coinfection with bvdv-2b table 1 which was detected by ihc within the arteriolar lesions in the lung and was thus suspected to have caused the arteriolitis case 4 from the same outbreak had pathological findings including severe extensive fibrinosuppurative bronchopneumonia involving approximately 70 of the pulmonary parenchyma and fibrinous pleuritis the tongue showed multifocal necrosis of the basal keratinocyte layer in the mucosa and multifocal apoptosis of individual keratinocytes in the esophagus and rumen histophilus somni was isolated from the lung and viral causes of pneumonia were ruled out online resource 1 bvdv was identified in a frozen sample of pooled tissues by rt-qpcr ct 2608 and genome sequencing revealed the same subtype as in case 3 of this outbreak genbank mn159204 ihc for bvdv antigen revealed focal intralesional immunolabeling in the basal mucosal epithelium of the tongue in the cytoplasm of the endothelial and muscular cells of blood vessels in the lungs and in macrophages infiltrating the pleura and interstitium no immunolabeling was found in the kidney lymph node heart intestinal or rumen tissues h somni bronchopneumonia was diagnosed table 1 in coinfection with bvdv-2b that was detected by ihc in the pulmonary and lingual lesions outbreak 4 occurred in a feedlot with approximately 300 beef cattle from different origins an approximately 2-year-old beef steer of undetermined breed case 5 presented inappetence and stopped drinking water antibiotic treatment penicillin g procaine and dihydrostreptomycin was administered for 5 days however the steer died after a 10-day clinical course within 6 months two other steers with similar clinical presentations died yielding a 1 mortality rate a partial necropsy was performed by the veterinary practitioner and some organs including the kidney heart liver urinary bladder and small and large intestines were submitted to the diagnostic laboratory pathological findings in the kidneys included extensive cortical coagulative necrosis renal infarcts fig 3a and occasional necrotizing segmental arteriolitis with thrombosis fig 3b severe acutesubacute transmural necrotizing fibrinosuppurative and hemorrhagic urocystitis with thrombosis and individual necrosis of arteriolar leiomyocytes was also present in addition focal acute mild colitis with necrotizing cryptitis was observed bvdv was detected by rt-qpcr ct 3404 from the frozen tissue pool and further identified as bvdv-1a via sequencing genbank mn159221 ihc for bvdv antigen detection showed multifocal and infrequent cytoplasmic immunolabeling in macrophages infiltrating the urinary bladder mucosa no labeling was seen in any other analyzed tissues liver kidney spleen lung and colon additionally in this case streptococcus sp was isolated from the kidney and escherichia coli was isolated from the kidney urinary bladder and liver online resource 1 these were considered potential opportunistic secondary pathogens because bvdv ihc was negative in multiple tissues except the bladder an acutetransient bvdv-1a infection was suspected outbreak 5 occurred at a calf-rearing and steer-fattening operation with 708 cattle of different breeds and origins between january and april 2018 12 holstein steers 17 presented emaciation anorexia isolation and diarrhea and died after a 1-month clinical course an approximately 4-year-old holstein steer case 6 in poor-body condition was necropsied the pathological examination revealed a chronic enteropathy affecting the ileum and colon characterized by depletion of intestinal glandscrypts in the mucosa occasional neutrophilicnecrotizing cryptitis and infrequent intraepithelial coccidia morphologically compatible with eimeira spp additionally multifocal moderate chronic lymphocytic interstitial nephritis was observed as well as moderate pleuritis with pleural fibrosis and fibrosing interstitial pneumonia and moderate suppurative lymphadenitis of undetermined etiology ihc for bvdv revealed strong and abundant finely granular and homogeneous intracytoplasmic immunolabeling in the epithelial cells which was diffuse throughout all examined tissues lung intestines liver and kidney bvdv was detected in the serum by rt-qpcr ct 2875 and bvdv-1a was identified by sequencing genbank mn186041 other causes of enterocolitis were ruled out including salmonella spp mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis bovine coronavirus and group a rotavirus online resource 1 based on the overall results this was likely either a pi calf with bvdv-1a or a severe transient infection outbreak 6 occurred at a dairy farm of unknown herd size where an increased abortion rate was registered two aborted holstein fetuses cases 7 and 8 of approximately 180210 gestational days were necropsied for case 7 the diagnostic investigation did not allow determining the cause of the abortion because the fetus presented no lesions and all ancillary diagnostic tests were negative online resource 1 except the rt-qpcr for bvdv ct 3217 which was positive from a pool of fetal tissues in case 8 the histological examination revealed moderate multifocal lymphohistiocytic necrotizing encephalitis severe random multifocal necrotizing hepatitis moderate multifocal lymphocytic myocarditis and multifocal lymphohistiocytic placentitis with trophoblast necrosis all lesions were highly compatible with neosporosis neospora caninum was detected intralesionally by ihc in the brain and by pcr in the same tissue online resource 1 bvdv was detected by rt-qpcr ct 3390 from the pool of fetal tissues bvdv-2b was identified in both fetuses by sequencing genbank mn186039 and mn186040 ihc for bvdv antigen detection was negative in tissues from both fetuses including the brain lung and spleen in case 7 and the brain kidney liver and spleen in case 8 based on these results acutetransient bvdv infections rather than pi were suspected in both cases table 1 as shown in fig 4 the phylogenetic analysis revealed that 4 of the strains were bvdv-1a and the other 4 bvdv-2b with bootstrap values of 71 and 63 respectively the diagnoses of bvdv infection in 8 cases reported here were based on viral genome detection by rt-qpcr along with detailed pathological examinations to characterize the lesions and ihc to identify bvdv antigen in the tissues of the deceased cattle the bvdv subtype involved in all cases was identified by sequencing the 5utr genomic region ancillary tests were performed to identify coinfections and to rule inout differential diagnoses on a case-by-case basis online resource 1 diagnostic investigations in the 8 cases were compatible with different bvdv infection outcomes including md case 1 and eventually case 6 transplacentalcongenital transmission with potential transientacute fetal infection cases 2 7 and 8 transientacute postnatal infections associated with coinfections by pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella typhimurium case 3 and histophilus somni case 4 or opportunistic bacteria such as streptococcus sp and e coli case 5 or eventually severely transient infection associated with enteric coccidia case 6 the clinical signs and pathological findings in the heifer from outbreak 1 were those typically described in the literature for md cases 13 27 detection of the viral genome and the colocalization of bvdv antigen intralesionally by ihc confirmed the etiological diagnosis while other causes of necrotizing colitis such as salmonella spp and bovine coronavirus were ruled out 13 the occurrence of md requires the presence of pi animals congenitally infected with bvdv which are the main source of infections in the herds pi cattle are viremic lifelong viral shedders and immunotolerant to the ncp strain with which they are infected because their immune systems do not recognize the bvdv antigens as foreign thus leading to extensive viral replication in the target cells 13 27 in our case viremia was confirmed by identifying bvdv-1a in the serum while ihc allowed detecting abundant viral antigen in the alimentary tract tissues esophagus small and large intestines which showed typical md lesions md occurs in pi animals when the ncp bvdv strain is converted to the cytopathic biotype via mutation recombination andor genomic rearrangements generally the ns23 viral protease containing the ncp strain is cleaved to ns2 and ns3 in the cytopathic strains 12 28 this results in a devastating infection that destroys the host cells to which the animals immune system cannot respond 13 pi neonate calves may be clinically normal weak born smaller than normal or show growth retardation however most die of md before 2 years of age 12 13 which is the same age range of the heifer with md in case 1 the 4-year-old steer in outbreak 5 case 6 presented severe intestinal histological lesions compatible with md although no macroscopic lesions typical of md were observed in the digestive tract this reinforces the idea that pi animals can remain asymptomatic in the herds for more than 2 years perpetuating infection and disease in bvdv pi cattle ihc should show strong positive immunolabeling in all or most tissuesorgans since infection in these animals is disseminatedmultisystemic and the tissues usually contain high viral loads 29 the strong widespread intra- and extralesional immunolabeling in the lungs intestines liver and kidneys of case 6 along with the viral genome detected in the serum indicated that this steer was viremic and most likely represented a pi animal fetal responses to bvdv infection are influenced mainly by gestational age fetal immune response and viral biotype and subtype 29 30 abortions at 68 gestational months identified as cases 2 and 8 in this work were most likely caused by n caninum given the nature of the fetal lesions which were typical of this protozoan and its intralesional detection via ihc in the brainmyocardium as well as by pcr in the brain in both cases however coinfections with bvdv-1a case 2 and bvdv-2b case 8 were identified by rt-qpcrsequencing indicating a congenitaltransplacental circulation and transmission of both viral speciessubtypes in these fetuses because fetuses infected with ncp bvdv strains before the 4th gestational month are generally immunotolerant to the virus and therefore develop persistent infections the viral load in pi fetal tissues is usually high and detectable by ihc 29 in contrast in our fetuses cases 2 7 and 8 the virus was undetected by ihc although it was identified by rt-qpcr suggesting that the viral load may have been below the ihc detection limit and indirectly suggesting that these fetal infections were transientacute the roles of bvdv-1a and bvdv-2b infections as causes of abortions in these cases could not be determined interestingly in a study conducted in dairy cattle bvdv-induced immunosuppression was hypothesized to contribute to the occurrence of abortions due to n caninum 31 although more detailed investigations are needed to confirm the possible synergistic association between these agents 32 fetuses that survive ncp bvdv strain infections before day 90 and more rarely up to day 125 of gestation invariably develop immunotolerance to the virus and are born pi 33 immunotolerance is postulated to be mediated by the viruss ability to inhibit type i interferon production in infected fetal cells allowing the infection to persist 34 however depending on the gestational age and viral strain transplacental infection can also result in embryonicfetal death reabsorption mummification or abortion congenital malformations or birth of clinically healthy calves 30 35 bvdv subtyping of the case 2 fetus outbreak 2 was identified as bvdv-1a while for the case 7 and 8 fetuses outbreak 6 subtyping was identified as bvdv-2b bielefeldt-ohmann et al 29 reported that both bvdv-2 and bvdv-1b have a similar tissue tropism although bvdv-2 passes through the placenta more quickly additionally antigenic immunolabeling in the fetal tissues was more intense for bvdv-2 than for bvdv-1b 29 in the 3 fetuses evaluated in our study bvdv immunolabeling was negative in all analyzed tissues independent of the infecting viral speciessubtype this finding suggests that the fetuses were not pi but rather were acutelytransiently infected which may or may not have contributed to abortion due to n caninum in cases 2 and 8 as discussed previously when infection occurs in the last third of gestation the fetal bovine immune system is sufficiently developed to respond to the virus being comparable with a transient postnatal infection 35 36 serological assays to assess whether these fetuses had developed specific humoral responses to bvdv were not performed in our study transientacute bvdv infections are largely subclinical or cause mild clinical signs although they can induce leukopenia lymphopenia monocytopenia and reduce antibody production and neutrophil release and function resulting in immunosuppression such immunosuppression favors secondary bacterial andor viral infections 13 that can contribute to respiratory digestive or septicemic diseases 13 37 in the three animals from outbreaks 3 and 4 cases 35 bvdv infection likely contributed to the occurrence of pneumonic histophilosis case 3 entericsepticemic salmonellosis case 4 and septicemia or urinary infection by opportunistic pathogens such as streptococcus sp and e coli case 5 these coinfections were confirmed by isolating the bacterial agents involved in each case and their pathogenic role was established by evaluating the lesions compatible with those caused by these agents in the respective pathological examinations acquiring animals without checking their bvdv infection status is an important risk factor for bvdv infection in cattle herds this is directly related to introducing pi animals that can carry the infection or new viral strains into the herds 3841 in 3 of the outbreaks reported here outbreaks 35 the anamnestic information revealed that cattle from different origins were introduced and mixed into the herds without prior bvdv testing which possibly contributed to disseminating and spreading infection and disease between farms detecting and removing infected cattle from the herds is key in controlling bvdv infections bvdv-2 is generally considered more virulent being frequently related to disease and death 36 42 however in a study conducted in the usa both bvdv-1 and bvdv-2 were diagnosed in cattle with clinical respiratory and digestive manifestations as well as in necropsied cattle 42 with bvdv-1 being the most common species 42 43 bvdv-1a cases 1 5 and 6 and bvdv-2b cases 3 and 4 were identified in heiferssteers in our work indicating that both species are related to postnatal morbidity and mortality in cattle in uruguay in other south american countries clinical disease has been reported for bvdv-1a bvdv-1b bvdv-2a and bvdv-2b in argentina 4446 bvdv-1b bvdv-1d bvdv-1i and bvdv-2b in brazil 4750 and bvdv-1a bvdv-1b and bvdv-1c in chile and peru 17 51 although cattle exposed to bvdv in utero constitute a significant portion of clinical presentations cases of transientacute postnatal infection may be significant sources of direct losses 1 several of the deaths reported in outbreaks 3 and 4 cases 35 were likely due to transientacute bvdv infections aggravated by secondary bacterial infections the arteriolitis observed in case 3 is a lesion frequently found in bvdv cases 13 whereas it is not a typical finding in salmonellosis 52 the agent with which this calf was coinfected this case presented typical lesions of both agents and although salmonella typhimurium can cause disease and death by itself it also behaves as an opportunistic pathogen and thus in this case the bvdv may have predisposed to clinical salmonellosis additional evidence of transientacute infection in these cases included detection of intralesional bvdv antigens by ihc in only some of the calf tissues examined by this technique the ihc performed in this study used a commercial monoclonal primary antibody against bvdv glycoprotein 55 envelope glycoprotein e2 made using the bvdv nadl strain although this antibody binds to and cross-reacts with most bvdv strains it does not bind to some strains such as oregon c24v used to produce vaccines in the usa per the manufacturer and published information 53 the major glycoprotein e2 is the most variable and immunodominant glycoprotein in bvdv and as such some strains may not bind to this antibody 54 our results indicated that this procedure enabled identifying at least four uruguayan field strains three bvdv-1a strains from outbreaks 1 4 and 5 and one bvdv-2b strain from outbreak 3 however additional cross-neutralization studies should be performed to assess whether this antibody cross-reacts with other local field bvdv strains since reduced reactivity of anti-bvdv antibodies has been identified to cause failed detection of field isolates particularly bvdv-2a 55 in uruguay a serological study conducted in beef cattle in 20002001 indicated that 69 of 6358 animals were seropositive and that 100 of 230 herds had at least one seropositive animal 22 even with a high viral circulation in the countrys cattle population only 3 of farmers implement preventive vaccinations 22 more recently active bvdv infections in cattle in uruguay were explored in a study in which 390 serum samples from 14 herds were analyzed to search for viral antigens by capture elisa and for viral genomes by rt-qpcr sixteen 41 of these animals were positive by both techniques 18 suggesting that they were either pi animals andor acutetransient infections acquired postnatally interestingly the mortality rate was 35 in the herd with md from outbreak 1 in our study suggesting hypothetically that 35 of this herd could have been pi animals a value close to that found by maya et al 18 although the prevalence of pi animals in a herd is generally  2 it can be as high as 2530 in herds where many cowsheifers were exposed to ncp bvdv strains during early pregnancy 13 the only published study to explore bvdv genetic diversity in uruguay found that the main speciessubtype was bvdv-1a 18 coincidentally this subtype was found in the md case outbreak 1 and in outbreaks 2 4 and 5 described herein indicating that besides being frequent this subtype is associated with disease and death in cattle which is unprecedented in uruguay in the scientific literature based on our results bvdv-2b can also be regarded as a significant cause of disease in uruguay in addition this work expands the geographical distribution south and the biotype of infected cattle dairy in uruguay for bvdv-2b since this subtype had previously been detected only in beef cattle in the department of rivera in northern uruguay 18 vaccines commercially available for bvdv prevention in uruguay are manufactured with inactivated virus and can only provide partial protection unlike modified-live vaccines used in other regions 56 including south american countries such as brazil 57 recent investigations in argentina have led to developing an enhanced bvdv subunit vaccine expressed in a baculovirus based on a truncated e2 glycoprotein fused to a single-chain antibody that targets antigen-presenting cells 58 this vaccines immunogenicity was tested in guinea pigs and cattle and immunized cattle developed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against bvdv up to 1 year after immunization based on these results the vaccine was scaled up and registered and is being commercialized as the first argentinean subunit vaccine for cattle 59 whether these vaccines protect against uruguayan bvdv strains remains to be addressed bvdv causes pathology and is associated with diseases and mortality in beef and dairy cattle in uruguay more extensive and systematic studies are necessary to determine the epidemiology and economic impacts of bvdv for livestock in uruguay as well as the distribution and frequency of the different speciessubtypes involved in clinical settings cost-benefit analyses and feasibility studies could help establish preventive and control programs for bvdv at the farm regional and national levels  etiology and genetic evolution of canine coronavirus circulating in five provinces of china during 2018-2019 as the outbreaks of covid-19 in worldwide coronavirus has once again caught the attention of people canine coronavirus is widespread among dog population and sometimes causes even fatal cases here to characterize the prevalence and evolution of current circulating canine coronavirus ccov strains in china we collected 213 fecal samples from diarrheic pet dogs between 2018 and 2019 of the 213 samples we found 51 2394 were positive for ccov co-infection with canine parvovirus cpv canine astrovirus caastv canine kobuvirus cakv torque teno canis virus ttcav were ubiquitous existed mixed infection of different ccov subtypes exists extensively considering the limited sequences data in recent years we sequenced 7 nearly complete genomes and 10 complete spike gene phylogenetic analysis of spike gene revealed a new subtype ccov-ii variant and ccov-iia was the most prevalent subtype currently circulating moreover we identified strain b906zj2019 shared 9324 nucleotide identifies with previous strain a76 and both of them clustered with ccov-ii variant which were not well clustered with the known subtypes recombination analysis of b906zj2019 indicated that strain b906zj2019 may a recombinant variant between ccov-i and ccov-ii which is consistent with strain a76 furthermore amino acid variations widely existed among current ccov-iia strains circulating in china and the classic ccov-iia strains in spite of the unknown functions in a word we report a useful information as to the etiology and evolution of canine coronavirus in china based on the available sequences which is urgent for the devise of future effective disease prevention and control strategies he hai-jian  zhang wenyan  liang jiawei  lu meng  wang ruyi  li gairu  he jia-wei  chen jun  xing gang  chen ye selecting genotyping oligo probes via logical analysis of data kwangsoo kim hong ryoo seo  based on the general framework of logical analysis of data we develop a probe design method for selecting short oligo probes for genotyping applications in this paper when extensively tested on genomic sequences downloaded from the lost alamos national laboratory and the national center of biotechnology information websites in various monospecific and polyspecific in silico experimental settings the proposed probe design method selected a small number of oligo probes of length 7 or 8 nucleotides that perfectly classified all unseen testing sequences these results well illustrate the utility of the proposed method in genotyping applications  a microarray or a dna chip is a small glass or silica surface bearing dna probes probes are single stranded reverse transcribed mrnas each located at a specific spot of the chip for hybridization with its watson-crick complementary sequence in a target to form the double helix 1  microarrays currently use two forms of probes namely oligonucleotide shortly oligo and cdna and have prevalently been used in the analysis of gene expression levels which measures the amount of gene expression in a cell by observing the hybridization of mrna to different probes each targeting a specific gene with the ability to identify a specific target in a biological sample microarrays are also well-suited for detecting biological agents for genetic and chronic disease 2 3 4 5  furthermore as viral pathogens can be detected at the molecular and genomic level much before the onset of physical symptoms in a patient the microarray technology can be used for an early detection of patients infected with viral pathogens 6 7 8  the success of microarrays depends on the quality of probes that are tethered on the chip having an optimized set of probes is beneficial for two reasons one the background hybridization is minimized hence true gene expression levels can be more accurately determined 9  the other as the number of oligos needed per gene is minimized the cost of each microarray is minimized or the number of genes on each chip is increased yielding oligo fingerprinting a much faster and more cost-efficient technique 9 10  short probes consisting of 15-25 nucleotides nt are used in genotyping applications 1  having short optimal probes means a high genotyping accuracy in terms of both sensitivity and specificity 6 9 and can play a key role in genotyping applications from the perspective of numerical optimization genomic data present an unprecedented challenge for supervised learning approaches for a number of reasons first genomic data are long sequences over the nucleic acid alphabet   acgt second for example the complexity of viral flora owing to constantly evolving viral serotypes requires a supervised learning theory to be trained on a large collection of target and non-target samples that is a typical training set contains a large number of large-scale samples third a supervised learning framework usually requires a systematic pairing or differencing between each target and non-target samples during the course of training a decision rule 10 11 12 13  adding to these the nature of data classification is difficult 14  based on the general framework of logical analysis of data lad from 15  we develop in this paper a probe design method for selecting short oligo probes of length l nt where l  6 10  to list some advantages of selecting oligo probes by the proposed method first the method selects probes via sequential solution of a small number of compact set covering sc instances which offers a great advantage from computational point of view to be more specific consider classification of two types of data and suppose that a training set is comprised of m  target and m  non-target sequences the size of the sc training instances solved by the proposed method is minimum of m  and m  orders of magnitude smaller than optimization learning models used in 10 11 12  second the method uses the sequence information only and selects probes via optimization based on principles of probability and statistics that is the probability of an lmer oligo of length l appearing in a single sequence by chance is 025 l  hence the probability of an lmer appearing in multiple samples of one type but in none or only a few of the sequences of the other type by chance alone is extremely small third the proposed method does not rely on any extra tool such as blastn 16  a local sequence alignment search tool that is commonly used for probe selection 6 8 17  or the existence of pre-selected representative probes 6  this makes the method truly stand-alone and free of problems that may possibly be caused by limitations associated with external factors last with an array of efficient meta-heuristic solution procedures for sc the proposed method is readily implementable for an efficient selection of oligo probes as for the organization of this paper we develop an effective method for selecting short oligo probes in section 2 for reasons of space we omit proofs for the mathematical results in this section and extensively test the proposed probe design method in various in silico genotyping experiments in section 3 with using viral genomic sequences from the los alamos national laboratory and the national center of biotechnology information websites the task of classifying more than two types of data can be accomplished by sequential classifications of two types of  and  data see 18 19 20 and section 3 below without loss of generality therefore we present the material below in the context of binary classification the backbone of the proposed procedure is lad a typical implementation of lad analyzes data on hand via four sequential stages of data binarization support feature selection pattern generation and classification rule formation as a boolean logic-based lad first converts all non-binary data into equivalent binary observations a   pattern in lad is defined as a conjunction of one or more binary attributes or their negations that distinguishes one or more   type observations from all   observations the number of attributes used in a pattern is called the degree of the pattern as seen from the definition patterns hold the structural information hidden in data after patterns are generated they are aggregated into a partially-defined boolean discriminant functionrule to generalize the discovered knowledge to classify new observations referring readers to 13 15 21 for more background in lad we design a lad-based method below for efficiently analyzing large-scale genomic data let there be m  and m  sample observations of type  target and  nontarget respectively for a dna sequence is a sequence of nucleic acids a c g and t and the training sequences need to be converted into boolean sequences of 0 and 1 before lad can be applied toward this end we first choose an integer value for l usually l  6 10 see section 3 generate all 4 l possible lmers over the four nucleic acid letters and then number them consecutively from 1 to 4 l by a mapping scheme next each lmer is selected in turn and every training sample is fingerprinted with the oligo for its presence or absence that is with oligo j we scan each sequence p i  i  s   s   from the beginning of the sequence and shifting to the right by a base and stamp p ij  1 if oligo j is present in sequence i and 0 otherwise after this the oligos that appear in all or none of the training sequences can be deleted from further consideration we re-number the surviving lmers consecutively from 1 to n and replace the original training sequences described in the nucleic acid alphabets by their boolean representations let n  1     n the data are now described by n attributes a j  0 1 j  n  for observation p i  i  s       let p ij denote the binary value the jth attribute takes in this observation denote by l j the literal of binary attribute a j  then l j  a j l j  a j  instructs to take negate the value of a j in all sequences a term t is a conjunction of literals given a term t let n t  n denote the index of literals included in the term then note here that n t of a  pattern identifies probes that collectively distinguish one or more  sequences from the sequences of the other type let us introduce n additional features a nj  j  n  and use a nj to negate a j  let n  1     2n and let us introduce a binary decision variable x j for a j  j  n  to determine whether to include l j in a pattern 15 formulated a compact mixed integer and linear programming milp model below with respect to a reference sample consider the following we note here that genomic data are large-scale in nature furthermore owing to constantly evolving viral serotypes the complexity of viral flora is high and this requires large numbers of target and non-target viral samples to be used for selecting optimal genotyping probes adding to these the difficulties associated with numerical solution of milp we see that milp-2i   above presents no practical way of selecting genotyping probes with the need to develop a more efficient pattern generation scheme we select a reference sequence for k  s and j  n next we set for l  s  and j  n now consider the set covering model where c j j  n  are positive real numbers let x y denote a feasible solution of sc  i  then forms a  lad pattern although smaller than the milp counterpart by only one constraint and one integer variable sc  i  has a much simpler structure and is defined only in terms of 0-1 variables in addition it can exploit any of sc heuristic procedures developed so far see for example 22 and references therein for its efficient solution hence is much preferred note that sc  i  is defined by m   m   1 cover inequalities and n  m   1 binary variables also recall that n is large for genomic sequences and the analysis of viral sequences requires large numbers of target and non-target sequences that is m  and m  are also large numbers to develop a more compact sc-based probe selection model we select a reference sequence p i  i  s       and set the values of a ik j for k  s and j  n via 1 consider the following sc model where c j s are positive reals theorem 2 let x denote a feasible solution of sc-pg  i  then p generated on x via 2 forms a  lad pattern below we use sc-pg  i  to design one simple oligo probe selection procedure let p  denote the set of  patterns generated so far  in this section we extensively test the proposed probe design for the classification of viral disease-agents in in silico setting with using genomic sequences obtained from the los alamos national laboratory lanl and the national center for biotechnology information ncbi table 1 summarizes the number and the length the minimum average1 standard deviation and maximum lengths of each type of the genomic data that were used in our experiments in analyzing data in an experiment we first decided on a length of oligos to use by calculating the smallest integer value l such that 4 l became larger than or equal to the average of the lengths of target and non-target sequences of the experiment then 4 l candidate oligos were generated to fingerprint and binarize the data note here that if a constraint in sc-pg  i  has all zero coefficients then the sc instance has no feasible solution and this case arises when the reference sequence p i  i  s   and the sequence p j  j  s have identical 0-1 fingerprints which is a contradiction supervised learning methodologies including lad presume for the existence of a classification function that each unique sequence in the training set belongs to exactly one of the two classes when data under analysis are indeed contradiction-free then contradiction-free 0-1 clones of the data can always be obtained by using oligos of longer length for data fingerprinting and binarization therefore when we generated the identical fingerprint for data of different types we incremented the value of l by 1 and repeated the data binarization stage until the binary representations of the data became contradiction free next procedure sc-pg was applied to generate patterns hence probes in applying procedure sc-pg in these in silico experiments we selected a minimal set of oligo probes by setting c j  1 for all j  n  for solving the unicost sc-pg  i s generated we used the textbook greedy heuristic 23 for ease of implementation denote by p  1      p  n and p  1      p  n the positive and negative patterns respectively generated via procedure sc-pg in classifying unseen  target and  non-target sequences we use three decision rules specifically for the polyspecific genotyping experiments in section 31 and experiments 2 and 3 in section 32 we form the standard lad classification rule 13   where   i denotes the number of  training sequences covered by p  i  we assign class   to new sequence p if p  0 p  0 we fail to classify sequence p if p  0 for monospecific genotyping in experiment 1 in section 32 we form a decision rule by  where p k 1      p k n k are the probes selected to for virus sub-type k and assign p to class k if  k p  0 while  i p  0 for all i  1     m i  k when p  0 for more than two virus types or  k p  0 for all k then we fail to assign a class to sequence p in each of the experiments in this section we tested the proposed oligo probe selection method in 20 independent hold-out experiments each with randomly selected 90 of the target and of the non-target data forming a training set of sequences and the remaining 10  of the target and of the non-target sequences forming the testing data more specifically after a training set of data was formed we binarized the training data and selected optimal oligo probes on them via procedure sc-pg next a classification rule was formed by one of 3 4 and 5 above and then used for classifying the corresponding testing sequences these steps were repeated 20 times to obtain the average testing performance and other relevant information of the experiment the computational platform used for these experiments was an intel 266ghz pentium linux pc with 512mb of memory 4 5 6 7 8 9 64 1341 143425 1467 the infection with hpv is the main cause of cervical cancer the second most common cancer in women worldwide 24 25  there are more than 80 identified types of hpv and the genital hpv types are subdivided into high and low risk types low risk hpv types are responsible for most common sexually transmitted viral infections while high risk hpv types are a crucial etiological factor for the development of cervical cancer 26  we applied the proposed probed design method on the 72 hpv sequences downloaded from lanl with their classification found in table 3 of 27  the selected probes were used to form a decision rule by 3 and tested for their classification capability results from this polyspecific probe selection experiment are provided in table 2  in this table and also in the table found in the following subsection the target  and the non-target  virus types of the experiments are first specified then the tables provide two bits of information on the candidate oligos namely the length l and the average and the standard deviation of the number of features generated and used in the 20 runs of each experiment for data binarization and for pattern generation provided next in the tables is the information on the number of probes selected in the format the average  1 standard deviation and information on the lad patterns generated finally the testing performance of the probes selected is provided in the last column of the tables summarized in format the average  1 standard deviation of the percentage of the correct classifications of the unseen sequences briefly summarizing the proposed probe design method selected probes on the hpv data in a few cpu seconds that tested 906 accurate in classifying the unseen hpv samples for comparison the same hpv dataset was used in 2 and 27 for the classification of hpv by high and low risk types in brief the probe design methods of 2 and 27 required several cpu hours of computation and selected probes that obtained 856 and 811 correct classification rates respectively before moving on we note that the sequences belonging to the target and the non-target groups in this experiment all have different hpv subtypes see table 3 in 27  the combination of all target and non-target sequences being different from one another and the presence of noise in the data the classification errors gave rise to selecting a relatively large number of polyspecific probes in this experiment the proposed probe design method was tested on genomic viral sequences from ncbi for selecting monospecific and polyspecific probes for screening for sars and ai in a number of different binary and multicategory experimental setting and performed superbly on all counts we describe individual experiments below and summarize results from these experiments in table 3  10 d e g

to group 2 coronavirus 28  105 sars sequences and 39 coronavirus samples were used to select 1 monospecific probe for screening for sars used in a classification rule 4 the sars probe and one probe selected for coronavirus together perfectly classified all testing sequences this experiment simulates a sars pandemic where suspected patients with sars-like symptoms are screened for the disease we used the 105 sars virus sequences and 108 samples of other influenza virus types the other virus in table 1  in this experiment and selected polyspecific probes used in a classification rule 3 these probes collectively gave the perfect classification of all testing sequences experiment 3 classification of lethal ai virus h5  h9 and other influenza virus h subtypes ai virus h5 and h9 subtypes cause a most fatal form of the disease 29  and they were separated from the other h subtypes of influenza virus in this experiment 241 h5 and h9 target sequences and 1010 other h subtype sequences were used to select polyspecific probes for detecting ai virus h5 and h9 subtypes from the rest in a classification rule 3 the selected probes collectively classified all testing sequences correctly the statement monospecific neuraminidase na subtype probes were insufficiently divers to allow confident na subtype assignment from 6 motivated us to design this experiment on multicategory and monospecific classification of influenza virus by n subtypes we used the three influenza virus n subtypes with 30 or more samples in table 1 and selected monospecific probes for their classification tested in a classification rule 5 the selected probes performed perfectly in classifying all testing sequences note that only a small number of monospecific probes were selected and proved needed in

these viruses and fcov types i and ii respectively pratelli et al 2003a however a putative recombination between ccov-ii and tgev at the 5end of the s protein gene gave rise to a new subtype as a result the ccov-ii genotype was divided into two subtypes ccov-iia classical strains and iib tgev-like strains decaro et al 2009 decaro et al 2010 infection may occur with a single strain but the two

an insertion of three nucleotides at the 5end of the spike gene resulting in the addition of an aa at residue five as in the ucd-1 strain these samples also showed three non-synonymous substitutions when compared to other ccov-iib strains table 3 according to the phylogenetic analysis result the brazilian ccov-iib strains formed a unique clade fig 1c mixed infections were detected in 1425 56

included in this analysis table 2 based on clinical reports three ccov-i-positive puppies presented mild enteric signs soft diarrhea while four ccov-iia-positive puppies showed more severe clinical signs vomiting hemorrhagic diarrhea one died during the hospitalization period a partial sequence analysis of the s gene showed aa identities of 987 to the pantropic strains described in the literature cb05 and 45007 in puppies with dual ccov or mixed infections the clinical signs varied from mild to fatally severe as shown in table 2 among 30 ccov-positive puppies 11 received either one 10 puppies or three doses 1 puppy of inactivated ccov vaccine another 12 had not been vaccinated and for the remaining seven the vaccination data were not available in the past decade several researchers have studied the importance of ccov as an agent of diarrhea in puppies decaro and buonavoglia 2011 le poder 2011 ntafis et al 2013 pratelli 2011 stavisky et al 2012 in brazil despite the availability of safe and effective vaccines cpv is considered the most common viral agent associated with enteritis in puppies castro et al 2010b castro et al 2011 however data regarding ccov infections in puppies have been restricted to serological surveys the main objective of this study was to conduct a molecular characterization of the ccov strains that circulate in brazil by partially amplifying the m and s genes the ccov genotypes may be distinguishable using molecular assays that are able to selectively amplify fragments of orf 5 m gene and orf 2 s gene in this study the aa changes found in residues 127 173 193 200 and 201 of the m protein could distinguish between ccov-i and ccov-ii strains these non-synonymous substitutions had already been described in european samples but the exact consequence of these mutations is not yet clear erles and brownlie 2009 ntafis et al 2013 pratelli et al 2003a ccov infection in dogs can occur with a single ccov strain or two strains may be present simultaneously decaro et al 2009 ntafis et al 2013 pratelli et al 2004a soma et al 2011 in addition the ccov-ii genotype has been further divided into two subtypes including the classical iia and the tgev-like iib ccovs decaro et al 2009 although partial amplification of the m gene has been successfully used to detect ccov-i and ii this approach does not distinguish between single or multiple ccovs in a dog or discriminate between iia and iib strains to genotypesubtype the ccov strains and to assess the occurrence of single or multiple ccov infections three different regions of the s gene were amplified it was shown that the classical ccov-iia was the most predominant type in single and double infections both ccov genotypes i and ii have been reported to be circulating in europe china and japan and ccov infections are frequently characterized by the simultaneous presence of both types decaro et al 2011 ntafis et al 2013 soma et al 2011 preliminary studies have indicated that multiple ccov or mixed infections may be related to more severe symptoms decaro et al 2006 pratelli et al 1999a in this study among the 25 ccov-positive puppies five had a fatal outcome all but one of which were cases of mixed infection it was shown that this one puppy was infected only with a ccov-iia strain that displayed the highest similarity to pantropic strains as extra-intestinal tissues of this puppy were not available for analysis it was not possible to confirm infection with a pantropic ccov in accord with other studies ntafis et al 2013 soma et al 2011 most of the ccov-positive puppies in this study were less than three months of age although ccov was detected in vaccinated puppies it should be emphasized that at this age the vaccination schedule has not been completed moreover the value of ccov vaccines in providing adequate immunity is controversial pratelli et al 2003b pratelli et al 2004b in the present study the ccov-i and iia strains showed high genetic similarity to each other and to the prototypes further studies are necessary to clarify the importance of the non-synonymous substitutions found only in the brazilian strains it was shown that the brazilian ccov-iib strains display an aa insertion that has also been described in ccov-iib-ucd-1 and tgev strains wesley 1999 this aa insertion has not been found in ccov-iib strains circulating in europe erles and brownlie 2009 ntafis et al 2013 most likely reflecting their geographic origin in summary the current study is the first report of a molecular characterization of the ccov-i iia and iib strains in brazil the results showed that all three types of ccov circulate among young puppies presenting mild or severe clinical signs of enteritis the brazilian strains displayed previously undescribed non-synonymous substitutions but further studies are necessary to clarify the exact consequence of these changes for ccov evolution the continuous monitoring of ccov will help to elucidate the genetic diversity of these viruses in the brazilian canine population none  h5n1 oseltamivir-resistance detection by real-time pcr using two high sensitivity labeled taqman

and vic 560 nm channels respectively data acquisition and analysis of the real-time pcr assay were performed using the rotor-gene data analysis software version 60 corbett research supporting program cdnas were amplified by pcr in a reaction mixture containing 10 l of 25 mastermix eppendorf 05 m primerf 5-atactgagaactcaagagtc-3 05 m primerr 5-ttatccctgcacacacatg-3 and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 25 l the amplification reaction was performed in a mastercycler personal eppendorf under the following conditions predenaturation at 94 c for 2 min followed by 40 amplification cycles comprising denaturation at 94 c for 30 s annealing at 55 c for 30 s and extension at 72 c for 30 s and concluded by a final extension at 72 c for 7 min the pcr products were separated by 2 agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using the gel extraction kit perfectprep gel cleanup eppendorf hamburg the purified products were inserted into pgem-t easy vector system promega according to the manufacturers protocol ten clones were randomly selected from the resultant white colonies and plasmids were purified using the high pure plasmid isolation kit roche gmbh according to the manufacturers specifications for automated dna sequencing all plasmids were amplified using the gene amp pcr system 9600 perkin-elmer ma the sequenced products were subjected to a perkin-elmer 310 sequence analyzer perkin-elmer the specificity of the dual probe real-time pcr was evaluated by cross-reaction tests carried out between rna extracts from isolates or clinical specimens expressing the entire spectrum of na subtypes n2-n9 of who reference strain influenza and other viral pathogens such as newcastle disease virus ndv respiratory syncytial virus rsv subgroups a and b human metapneumovirus hmpv coronavirus oc43 coronavirus 229e infectious bursal disease virus ibdv and infectious bronchitis virus ibv the sensitivity was established with plasmids containing a copy of the wild type h274 and mutant 274y serving as reference the wild type h274 and mutant 274y plasmids were used to determine the capacity of the real-time pcr assay to detect wild type and oseltamivir-resistant codon 274 mutants in a single sample dna concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 and 280 nm the two control plasmids were diluted to 104 103 102 and 10 copiesl and each resulting concentration was mixed at 1000 7525 5050 2575 and 0100 wild type-to-variant ratios real-time pcr analysis of potential codon 274 variants was performed on each ratio at each concentration under the conditions described above the result was obtained by using two taqman probes labeled with the fam and vic fluorescent signal for wild type and mutant detection respectively the fluorescent signal resulting from real-time pcr can be interpreted as shown in fig 1
 a sample containing only the wild type strain will emit the fluorescent signal exclusively via the fam channel 530 nm whereas a sample containing the oseltamivir-resistant variant with a nucleotide alteration at position 274 of the neuraminidase gene will emit the fluorescent signal via the vic channel 560 nm in order to develop and optimize the assay these probes were tested on four sets of mutagenesis and obtained clearly discernible results irrespective of the concentrations of wild type and mutant plasmids or the ratio in which they had been mixed the clinical samples tested in this assay were isolated from humans tigers leopard cat dog and various avian species previously infected with h5n1 two human specimens in this experiment were investigated the first one isolated from human plasma and collected in nakhon-nayok province showed a positive result for the wild type only in contrast the second one obtained from a vietnamese patient previously reported by le et al 2005 emitted signals specific for both wild type and mutant the remaining specimens originating from tiger lung spleen kidney and liver leopard brain and the allantoic fluid of various avian species cat and dog displayed positive results specific for the wild type only three specimens treated with oseltamivir were chosen to be cloned into plasmids for confirmation the first specimen was from a tiger atigerthailandcu-t704 isolated from zoo tigers that had perished during the mid-october 2004 h5n1 influenza outbreak cu-t7 was isolated from a nasal swab of a tiger that eventually perished but had been treated with oseltamivir at 75 mg60 kg twice daily for 4 days prior to specimen collection amonsin et al 2006 thanawongnuwech et al 2005 and inoculated into san-fowl eggs according to the method described by the office international des epizooties oie ten clones of cu-t7 were randomly selected and sequenced all the clones were sensitive to oseltamivir the second specimen was white tiger atigerthailandku-1104 was isolated from a sick white tiger found positive for h5n1 by nasal swab and subsequently treated with oseltamivir at 75 mg60 kg twice daily for 4 days this tiger survived and a rectal swab was taken this specimen was inoculated into san-fowl eggs ten clones of ku-11 were randomly selected and sequenced all the clones were sensitive to oseltamivir the third specimen was cdna from a vietnamese patient le et al 2005 ten clones of this strain were randomly selected and sequenced nine of the 10 clones were resistant to oseltamivir and only 1 clone was sensitive the specificity of the assay by cross-contamination tests were evaluated and found no cross-reactivity to total human dna any of the different na subtypes of influenza a virus newcastle disease virus ndv respiratory syncytial virus rsv subgroups a and b human metapneumovirus hmpv coronavirus oc43 coronavirus 229e infectious bursal disease virus ibdv and infectious bronchitis virus ibv likewise any significant false positive or non-specific signal in any of the samples tested was not observed overall the results obtained on oseltamivir resistance with the two labeled probes indicate a high specificity of both primers and probes used for amplification as for the sensitivity of real-time pcr the threshold concentration for detecting both wild type h274 and mutant 274y was 10 copiesl furthermore in order to establish the limits of real-time pcr to detect both wild type and mutant in the same sample wild type and mutant plasmids were mixed in various ratios and diluted them over a range of concentrations 1000 7525 5050 2575 and 0100 ratios of wild type and mutant the result showed the high sensitivity of the detection that can be detected although the reaction had 7525 plasmid copiesl of wild type and mutant at present there is a substantial risk of a global influenza a virus subtype h5n1 epidemic not only affecting poultry but also mammalian species including humans a medication capable of preventing the spread to humans is the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir yet influenza a virus subtype h5n1 has already developed drug resistance by mutations in the neuraminidase gene leading to amino acid substitutions predominantly at positions 119 152 274 and 292 n2 numbering system of the enzymes active site gubareva et al 2000 the amino acid substitution at position 274 identified in mutants selected in the presence of na inhibitors both in vivo and in vitro has exclusively been found in n1 gubareva et al 2002 in 2005 h5n1 virus resistant to oseltamivir due to an amino acid change from histidine h to tyrosine y based on a single nucleotide alteration at position 274 has been isolated from three vietnamese patients one of whom a 14 years old recovered le et al 2005 while the remaining two a 13 and 18 years old succumbed to the infection de jong et al 2005 hence patients found positive for h5n1 infection ought to be monitored for the nucleotide change at position 274 causing resistance to oseltamivir before the onset of treatment with the mutation detected in time alternative treatment applying for example zanamivir might save the patients life in this experiment both probes and primers were specifically designed to detect the nucleotide change causing oseltamivir resistance the amino acid substitution of histidine h with tyrosine y is the consequence of a single nucleotide in the first codon of this amino acid change from c to t the alignment of theh5n1 neuraminidase gene sequence with more than 200 sequences stored in the genbank database showed a nucleotide change in the specific probe area yet at a position not triggering the critical amino acid alteration hence the probe was designed to allow for this inconsequential mutation by using a degenerate nucleotide at that position thus closely mimicking the natural situation moreover since the conserved area of the gene restricted the probes length to 17 nucleotides taqman mgb was chosen the probe was coupled with a minor groove binder enhancing its tm and had a non-fluorescent quencher attached to the 3 end which does not interfere with fluorescent signal detection after having tested the probes with the mutagenesis control the result showed high sensitivity and correct distinction between wild type and mutant upon mixing different ratios of wild type and mutant plasmid at low concentrations in conclusion real-time pcr using two labeled taqman probes provides a highly specific and sensitive method to detect the amino acid alteration at position 274 of the influenza a subtype h5n1 neuraminidase gene causing oseltamivir resistance studies as the one described here could address the potential differences in diagnostic outcomes between patients who develop detectable oseltamivir resistance and patients who retain only the wild type strain of h5n1 however the other point mutations of oseltamivir resistance in h5n1 infected mammalian species need

and subsequent diarrhea in young and immunonaive dogs due to viral tropism to rapidly multiplying cells such as enterocytes in the intestinal crypts 11 3 successful vaccination programs using live attenuated cpv-2 vaccines exist but controversies arise between dog owners veterinarians and vaccine companies when diarrhea occurs within a few days of cpv-2 vaccine administration 4 reversion of the vaccine virus to a virulent cpv-2 virus has not been documented and is considered unlikely 3 it has been postulated that clinical signs of canine parvovirus a few days after cpv-2 vaccination result from a different disease or from a wild virulent cpv-2 subtypes incubating at the time of vaccination 3 diagnosing parvoviral enteritis in dogs is essential to ensuring suitable barrier nursing protocols within veterinary hospitals the current diagnostic trend is to use multiplexed pcr panels to detect an array of pathogens that commonly cause diarrhea in dogs 6 the multiplexed pcr assays do not distinguish wild from vaccine cpv-2 they are highly sensitive and detect even a low level of virus shedding such as those caused by the cpv-2 vaccine 6 interpretation of test results is based on quantitation of the viral load quantitative pcr and clinical presentation including commonly found panleucopenia on peripheral blood in fatal cases structural evidence can be utilized to complement qpcr and hematology to confirm parvoviral enteritis however the aim is accurate ante-mortem diagnosis that rapidly differentiates vaccine associated viral presence from wild-type parvoviral enteritis canine parvovirus cpv-2 emerged as a canine pathogen in the late 1970s in the 1980s two antigenic variants emerged cpv-2a and cpv-2b and eventually completely replaced the original cpv-2 9 cpv-2 is still used in many commercial vaccines with some more recently replacing this with cpv-2b differentiation of cpv-2 viruses is based on viral capsid protein sequence vp2 the original cpv-2 differs in five or six amino acid residues from cpv-2a and cpv-2b 2 3 and there are only two amino acid residues differentiating cpv-2a from cpv-2b 11 a more recently discovered strain cpv-2c is defined by a further single nucleotide change 3 the aim of this study was to identify the cpv-2 subtypes detected in diagnostic specimens presented to the veterinary pathology diagnostic service at the university of sydney diagnostic dilemmas for clinicians not uncommonly include the possibility of occult shedding of cpv-2 vaccine strains in diarrhea of other etiology and the possibility of vaccine breakdown

from type 2b 3 the cpv-2a subtypes were previously reported to be the most prevalent in dog populations in australia in 2007 8 the small scale of the current cohort does not imply the absence of cpv-2b or cpv-2c in australia subtypes that are now dominant in many other countries as high as 1450 canine parvovirus disease cases are self-reported by veterinarians in australia annually through disease watchdog a national disease surveillance program 12 7 13 investigation targeting recently identified rural areas with increased prevalence of canine parvovirus by ref 13 coupled with genotyping of the cpv-2 subtypes would facilitate improved understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of individual subtypes under australian conditions new nucleotide sequences were deposited in genbank under the following accession numbers ky242639-ky242647 closer inspection of the sequence from a sample 152378 suspected to contain vaccine-like cpv-2b revealed a variable nucleotide 4023 m38245 fig 1ac the animal was vaccinated with cpv-2b strain boehringer ingelheim vaccine one week prior to the clinical presentation of vomiting and diarrhea the nucleotide is typically a conserved guanidine in vaccine strains but in this case it included overlapping guanidine and adenine residues fig 1c the remaining vp2 sequence matched the cpv-2b ex protec vaccine suggesting presence of

antigen test kit idexx australia returned a positive result at the time of sampling mt-pcr returned a very low 10 take off time equivalent of low ct-value suggesting a large number of viral particles being shed in the patients feces unlike the low level shedding of vaccine cpv-2 strains in other dogs table 1 table 2 supplementary table 1 the dog was released to home care and it is not known whether it represented a biosecurity issue for other dogs the detected mutation is not reported to cause any change in virulence or strain type 1 further monitoring and evaluation of cpv-2 sequences is required to elucidate the frequency and origin of the observed mutation in the mt-pcr assay low take-off times 15 cycles typically suggest presence of a wild cpv-2 subtype as these are typically shed in greater numbers than vaccine strains in both cases of cpv-2a as well as the above mentioned case 152378 the take-off time was very early providing an initial indication from mt-pcr with the confirmatory evidence of presence of wild-type canine parvovirus in the sample via conventional pcr and dna sequencing parvovirus is detected frequently in pcr panels with 68 of 526 diarrheic dogs from australia testing positive for cpv-2 using idexx laboratories proprietary realpcr service platform 6 suggested that a cutoff value of 12 million cpv-2 gene equivalents per gram of stool discriminates vaccine strains from wild type cpv-2 infections the load itself is a valuable outcome as it enables veterinarians to put appropriate quarantine measures in place to contain the spread of the highly resilient virus on the other hand higher take-off times were indicative of presence of vaccine strain because vaccine virus is able to replicate in the dogs intestinal mucosa and shed into the feces 5 4 discriminating vaccine strain from a wild type viruses of cpv-2 is ambitious in urgent diagnostics as previously argued 4 in this study we have typed cpv-2 detected in canine feces by mt-pcr panel using partial vp2 amplification and dna sequencing the approach has demonstrated some limitations to the commonly used assay in particular with the application of the 555rev primer a yardstick approach to a copy number or ct-value to discriminate vaccine strain from a wild type viruses of cpv-2 can be in some cases potentially misleading  prevalence of human metapneumovirus in

 hmpv infection evokes incomplete immunity and re-infection can occur in people of all ages10 14 15 35 42 43 prevalent worldwide hmpv is an important respiratory pathogen that manifests in young children less than 5 years of age4 11 25 32 34 38 39 clinical symptoms caused by hmpv infection are similar to respiratory syncytial virus and include fever cough wheezing dyspnea rhinorrhea sputum production and asthma6 12 32 rates of hmpv infection range from 55 to 25 among children hospitalized with respiratory illness18 19 20 25 in adults the clinical manifestations of hmpv infection seem to depend on age and health conditions in young adults aged 1425 years the clinical symptoms of hmpv infection are similar to those of other respiratory viral infections in contrast in middle aged aged 2665 years and healthy elderly adults aged  65 years hmpv presents similarly to influenza infections and common colds13 although the incidence of hmpv infection in healthy adults during winter is generally less than 65 23 30 42 hmpv is considered to be a major contributor to the burden of respiratory illnesses in older adults42
 most studies of hmpv infection in adults have focused on the elderly and on immunocompromised people rather than on immunocompetent adults of all age groups although hmpv infection has been reported in healthy adults during winter seasons5 14 further study of hmpv infection in healthy adults is needed during all seasons in consecutive years to evaluate the circulation patterns clinical features

whereas hmpvb2 had 906100 and 882100 nucleotide and amino acid identity respectively in this study we used an rt-pcr assay to screen clinical specimens collected from adults with artis the hmpv p gene is an ideal molecular target for detection and genotyping of hmpv because its conserved sequences allow specific detection using rt-pcr and enough variability to permit distinction between genotypes3 28 four subtypes of hmpv and two clusters of hmpva2 were clearly distinguished through our phylogenetic analysis of hmpv p gene fragments all strains of hmpva2 were found to be hmpva2b the sensitivity of the rt-pcr assay was determined to be 52 copies per reaction which is at least as sensitive as reported for real-time rt-pcr assays previously24 29 the primer pair used in this study can also be applied to an sybr green rt-pcr system for quick screening of clinical specimens for hmpv based on data obtained from about 400 clinical specimens comparing sybr green rt-pcr and standard rt-pcr analysis data not shown no cross reactivity was observed for other propagated respiratory viruses indicating high specificity of the primer pair under the rt-pcr conditions used we observed an annual incidence of 17 for hmpv infection in immunocompetent adults with artis sampled over a period of two consecutive years in china similar annual incidences have been reported in the united states of america19 the united kingdom16 and in cambodia4 although the winter-spring season is traditionally regarded as the typical epidemic season of hmpv in temperate regions5 7 14 18 23 30 42 the results of our study show that the hmpv epidemic peaked during the winterspring season novemberfebruary of 20082009 and the spring-summer season marchjune of 2010 the hmpv seasonality observed in this study is comparable to that reported in japan31 which showed a biennial rhythm of hmpv seasonality with the epidemic peaking between november and march in odd years and between march and june in the successive even years1 2 31 our results indicate that hmpv seasonality in adults is similar to that in children the reason for this differing seasonality is unclear previous studies have shown that climate can affect seasonality4 7 17 33 37 however the climate records for beijing do not indicate significant variability between the same months of each study year data not shown it is possible that the pandemic of ah1n12009 affected the circulation of hmpv during the 2010 season based on our findings the surveillance of hmpv infection in immunocompetent adults should be extended from the winter season to year round to improve our understanding of the burden of hmpv infection hmpva1 was not detected in the patients sampled for this study the absence of hmpva1 in this study is consistent with other reports4 9 26 27 indeed circulation of hmpv genotypes has been reported to vary annually with replacement of predominant genotypes occurring every 13 years in a given population such genotype replacement is believed to result from adaptive immunity of a population to the predominant circulating genotype1 17 22 in this study analysis of the incidences of hmpv subtypes shows that hmpva represented by hmpva2 was declining whereas hmpvb hmpvb1 and b2 was rising from july 2008 to june 2010 thus it is possible that hmpva1 was in its troughs during the study period a longer study period would be required to investigate the prevalence patterns of hmpv subtypes children and elderly adults 65 years are reportedly at higher risk of hmpv infection due to incomplete immunity7 13 14 in this study the detection rate of hmpv 32 was highest in the elderly 65 years compared to that in other adult age groups consistent with previous reports12 14 23 in contrast to previous reports13 14 35 42 the detection rate of hmpv in teenagers 1425 year 09 was significantly lower than that in middle aged adults 2665 years 20 in our study the reason for this disparity is unclear further studies are needed to clarify the age distribution of hmpv infection in adults we observed a moderate detection rate of hmpv in chinese adults lower than that of influenza virus enterovirus rhinovirus and parainfluenza virus but higher than that of respiratory syncytial virus adenovirus and coronavirus if the observed data is extrapolated from the sampled subjects to the whole population 17 could be translated to a significant number of hmpv arti cases in china every year in summary this study reports the detection of hmpv and a large-scale detailed analysis of the prevalence and clinical symptoms of hmpv infection in healthy adults with artis in beijing china a biennial rhythm of hmpv seasonality in immunocompetent adults was observed as was a higher detection rate of hmpv in adults aged 65 compared to those in other adult age groups screened in this study our results improve current understanding of the pathogenesis of hmpv in healthy adults however as this study covered a limited population and a relatively short time period further investigations are required to characterize the infection of different hmpv subtypes in adults more thoroughly  emerging developments on pathogenicity molecular virulence epidemiology and clinical symptoms of current middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov kannan subbaram hemalatha kannan mansour khalil gatasheh   middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is a unique positive-sense single-stranded rna ssrna virus belonging to the genus betacoronavirus world health organization 2014 previously it was called novel coronavirus 2012 because it was isolated in 2012 by genomic sequencing from sputum of a patient during the 2012 outbreak of new flu zaki et al 2012 until august 2015 mers-cov outbreaks were reported in more than 21 nations like saudi arabia jordan egypt qatar uae turkey kuwait oman bangladesh indonesia algeria south korea philippines thailand usa uk and austria abdullah et al 2016 according to the european center for disease prevention and control it was estimated that out of a total of 1082 mers-cov cases there were 439 deaths thereby mortality rate leading to whooping 41 haagmans et al 2015 as per the world health organization estimates the fatality rate surged to 37 mers-cov patients have acquired this deadly infection through various sources namely infected humans camels bats other domesticated animals and pets world health organization 2015 the very nature and special feature of coronavirus is its ability to undergo rapid genetic rearrangement and profound molecular variation in its ssrna this rearrangement and variation of the viral genome resulting in new antigenic subtypes leads to difficulties in developing vaccines and therapeutic interventions chu et al 2016 hence mers-cov poses serious threat not only to the middle east region but also throughout the world as a whole genomes of mers-cov are phylogenetically grouped into clade a and clade b initially reported mers-cov cases belonged to clade a jordan-n32012 recently the newly reported cases were shown to be genetically different as such they were named as clade b based on molecular genetic and antigenic studies it was established that mers-cov is unique and different from severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and common cold coronaviruses because of this fact earlier mers-cov was called saudi sars azhar et al 2016 this notorious virus was first identified and isolated in saudi arabia by dr ali mohamed zaki from a patient suffering from pneumonia-like illness and these isolates exhibited cytopathic effects like syncytia formation through molecular clock analysis zoonotic transmission was established from dromedary camels camelus dromedaries particularly prevailing in middle east countries both mers-cov and sars coronavirus have similar ssrna in their genome this ssrna in mers-cov encodes structural proteins sps membrane protein m envelope e nucleocapsid n two non-structural replicase polyproteins orf1a and orf1b and spike s reusken et al 2016 the two non-structural proteins nsps initiate genomic replication and rna synthesis the huge replicase gene surrounds 5 proximal side of rna genome translation of orf1a gives rise to polyprotein 1a pp1a and ribosomal frame shifting makes translation of orf1b to give pp1ab mers-cov uses one or two papain-like protease to release nsps it is established that mers-cov possesses 16 nsps firth and brierley 2015 viral components like nsps sps m e n s and other proteins glycoproteins and enzymes play a crucial role in virulence in establishing and exaggerating the disease figure 1
 mers-covs e protein is responsible for the attachment of virus particles to host cell receptors s protein is in charge of fusion and entry in to the respiratory epithelia kilianski et al 2016 virus-induced proteases help viral particles to spread to lower parts of the lungs thus enhancing the severity of the infection it results in inflammation and suppression of anti-viral interferons ifn at this point of the infection there is excessive anti-viral immune responses like interleukins il-6 il-8 and tnf- humoral igg and igm are inefficient to control the viral spread and replication in the lungs the very nature of mers-cov virus ability to overcome and suppress host immune challenge is due to its ssrna viral sps and nsps mielech et al 2016 mers-cov exhibits its degree of pathogenicity based on the host it elicits maximum pathogenic potential especially in humans this is due to the fact that mers-cov shows a strong tropism for bronchial non-ciliated epithelia during this time it is proved that virus also arrests host bronchial ifn synthesis coleman et al 2015 mielech et al 2016 at this juncture it should be noted that most of other viruses causing respiratory diseases attack and damage epithelial cilia including influenza type a studies revealed that cellular receptors for mers-cov is exopeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 coleman et al 2015 moreover it was found that neutralization of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 by specific antibodies did not arrest the spread of infection into bronchus and lung alveolus extensive studies showed that another functional cellular receptors called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 were also involved in the severity of disease spread in the lungs due to mers-cov de wit et al 2015 moreover receptors for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 are also located in nephrons of kidneys and heart during the acute stage of the mers-cov infection there is severe viremia leading to the spread of mers-cov virus particles in blood stream at this point mers-cov exhibits the hall mark of infection leading to not only to the damage of lungs but also kidneys and heart thereby resulting in respiratory renal and cardiac failure ultimately leading to coma and death vanboheemen et al 2016 the severity is worsened by concurrent secondary bacterial infections recent research showed that bacterial infections due to staphylococcus aureus group a streptococcus streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae type b augment the pathogenic potential of mers-cov particularly in humans these bacteria particularly dwell in the oral cavities tonsils and pharynx of humans lau et al 2016 another interesting fact is that the reservoir host dromedary camels and other animals do not exhibit the presence of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 receptors in their kidneys and heart in humans after the entry of mers-cov viral particles in to lung alveoles alveolar macrophages fail to contain the spread of infection the strong host cellular immune response and cytokine release lead to inflammation and fluid accumulation in lungs this will result in the characteristic symptoms of mers-cov high fever chills rigors severe cough dyspnoea and hypovolemic shock lin et al 2016 many patients exhibited common symptoms of pneumonia whereas a significant number of patients expressed symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary syndrome like disease another large number of patients also revealed laryngotracheobronchitis which is called croup the patterns of disease due to mers-cov also differed among different age groups clinical cases morbidity and mortality rates due to mers-cov infections are more common and high 80 in the age group of 3545 years astonishingly the severity of mers-cov is lower 40 in the higher age groups particularly above 55 years lei et al 2015 epidemiology and mode of spread of mers-cov play a crucial role in morbidity and fatality due to these life-threatening viruses different ways of transmission of mers-cov have been documented corman et al 2015 they include dromedary camel to human mode bats to camels among camels cattle to man dogs to humans cats to man bats to humans and finally man to man transmission human to human spread is very effective and common in close contacts and crowded surroundings nosocomial hospital-borne outbreaks have also been reported in many instances there have been reported incidences of spread from patients to health care workers song et al 2015 in mers-cov epidemiology dromedary camels play an important role because these animals act as reservoir host dromedary camels also act as gene mixing vessels when two different strains of mers-cov from two different sources infect dromedary camels these two genetically different mers-cov exchange their ssrna resulting in the development mutation of new subtypes of mers-cov the stunning features of these new subtypes of mers-cov have new antigens and novel virulence genes in saudi arabia there were possible cases of human transmission after drinking camel milk but there are no cases documented in humans through ingestion of camel meat de wit et al 2016 patients suffering from mers exhibited low white blood cell count in particular of low lymphocytes confirmation and rapid molecular testing can be performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr test rt-pcr testing can be performed on bronchoalveolar lavage sputum and tracheal aspirates serological test like immunofluorescence technique ift is also useful but the main issue with ift is many other serologically related viruses may cross-react with mers-cov antibodies so ift is unsuitable for confirmation world health organization recommends rt-pcr for the confirmation of mers-cov in clinical samples bez-santos et al 2014 because the main transmission is through camels people should be advised to handle camels with precautions especially camels with severe nasal discharge other general health care measures should be taken to arrest nosocomial hospital-borne mers-cov outbreaks for the treatment of mers-cov cases administration of ribavirin and ifn-2b was found to be promising but not very effective researchers are recently investigating many ways to overcome the outbreak of mers-cov many drugs are under evaluation ifn chloroquine chlorpromazine loperamide camostat mycophenolic acid and lopinavir de wit et al 2016 mers-cov causes severe life threatening and rapidly spreading middle east respiratory syndrome not only in middle east region but throughout the world dromedary camels and bats play an important role in the spread of mers-cov several nosocomial infections due to mers-cov have also been reported worldwide several viral sps and nsps are critical for the molecular virulence of mers-cov because of the ssrna mers-cov can undergo molecular rearrangement leading to antigenic change genetic variation and mutation this attributes to the emergence of new and novel subtypes of mers-cov in the human populations these unique subtypes are difficult to control by vaccinations and therapeutic intervention strategies another important issue faced by scientists and molecular virologists is related to these new mers-cov viral particles which possess enhanced molecular virulence thus leading to increased pathogenicity and a more rapid spread than their parental strains studies revealed that dromedary camels act as gene mixing vessels for mers-cov prevention is mainly based on avoiding contact with dromedary camels and focussing on nosocomial infection outbreaks researchers are constantly trying to develop anti-viral drugs to combat mers-cov but till today there is no breakthrough the perspective of what can we expect in the future of this field is developing effective vaccine conducting detailed studies on molecular research on mechanism of mutation and genetic recombination occurring in mers-cov there is no conflict of interest we would like to acknowledge university

review edoardo agosti andrea giorgianni francesco damore gabriele vinacci sergio balbi davide locatelli   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is the infectious agent of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 starting from the first case recorded in wuhan china in december 2019 sars-cov-2 quickly spread around the world leading the world health organization to declare pandemic 1 to date june 6th 2020 the confirmed cases in the world are around 66 million and more than 390000 deaths 2 covid-19 is a systemic infection that usually presents with fatigue and fever the most frequent symptoms described are respiratory and gastrointestinal 3 however neurological complications have recently been reported including dizziness headache febrile seizures myalgia encephalopathy encephalitis stroke and acute peripheral nerve diseases 4 5 some cases of acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy amsan and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy aidp subtypes of guillain-barr syndrome gbs have recently been described gbs is an acute immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy often related to previous infectious exposure 68 clinically gbs is characterized by limbs or cranial-nerve weakness loss of deep tendon reflexes sensory and dysautonomic symptoms due to peripheral nerves and root demyelination andor axonal damage 9 about 60 of all gbs are preceded by respiratory or a gastrointestinal 10 we reported a case of covid-19 patient with aidp subtype of gbs associating a literature review on the sars-cov-2 and gbs etiological correlation on april 26th 2020 a 68-year-old man presented to the emergency department with symptoms of acute progressive symmetric ascending flaccid tetraparesis patient medical history included dyslipidemia benign prostatic hypertrophy hypertension and abdominal aortic aneurysm in follow-up ten days before admission dry cough associated with fever dysgeusia and hyposmia appeared neurological manifestations started 5 days later with progressive acute weakness of distal lower extremities on admission oxygen saturation was 96 on room air with a respiratory rate of 17 breathsmin and the body temperature was 372 c chest computed tomography highlighted a bilateral basilar ground glass opacity with oropharyngeal swab positive for sars-cov-2 on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay no pathological findings were auscultated on pulmonary objective examination the patient was then isolated and antiviral drugs have been started neurological examination showed bifacial nerve palsy house-brackmann grade 3 and muscular weakness with a medical research council scale of 15 in proximal and 25 in distal of the lower limbs the osteo-tendon reflexes were hypoactive with bilateral areflexia to the achilles tendons no sensory deficit was recorded upper motor neuron disorder or meningeal irritation signs have not been found baseline laboratoristic analysis showed

vitamin b12 level and serum protein electrophoresis were found four days after neurological symptoms and signs onset motor nerve conduction studies showed delayed distal latencies and absent f waves in early course supporting demyelinating pattern in accordance with gbs diagnostic criteria table 1 sensory nerve conduction showed nerve action potentials the recorded values were all in range in line with the patient clinic a diagnosis of guillain-barr syndrome was then made intravenous immunoglobulin was administered at a dose of 04 gkg for 5 days thrombocytopenia and lymphocytopenia progressively returned in the following days with complete resolution of the admission radiological pulmonary findings the improvement of the respiratory and laboratory clinic was followed by a progressive recovery of limb strength and a return to osteo-tendon normoreflexia thirty days after hospitalization following the negative result of the oropharyngeal swab for sars-cov-2 the patient was discharged to continue the rehabilitation program at home we described a case of acute progressive symmetric ascending flaccid tetraparesis in a covid-19 patient with diagnosis of aidp subtype of gbs the anamnestic clinical electrophysiological and laboratory evidence leads to a likely causal association with sars-cov-2 starting from the first case of gbs sars-cov-2 infection-related described by zhao h et al 11 a series of cases have been reported in the literature supporting the post-infectious and para-infectious etiopathological correlation between sars-cov-2 and this acute polyradiculoneuropathy table 2 a systematic review of the literature on gbs and its correlation with sars-cov-2 infection was performed multiple searches were made on pubmed and scopus by cross-referencing the following keywords guillan-barr guillan-barr syndrome covid-19 sars-cov-2 para-infectious post-infectious molecular mimicry neuropathy flaccid polyradiculoneuropathy ace-2 pathogenesis other pertinent articles were retrieved through reference analysis inclusion criteria were the report of gbs clinical manifestation in covid-19 patients to date june 6th 2020 16 papers have been published regarding the gbs-sars-cov-2 correlation adding up all the cases reported in the literature 23 covid-19 patients with gbs have been described including our case report there was no gender prevalence and the average age of the patients was 61 years a slight prevalence of aidp over amsan subtype was observed post-infectious cases were predominant over para-infectious cases gbs is an acute flaccid paralytic disease that most commonly presents with progressive symmetric weakness and areflexia gbs usually occurs following a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection with a presentation latency varying between 3 days and 6 weeks 9 the supposed pathophysiological mechanism is the molecular mimicry an aberrant autoimmune response to a preceding infection which evokes a cross-reaction against the peripheral nerve antigens eg production of anti-ganglioside antibodies in amsan gbs subtype preceded by campylobacter jejuni infection 9 for this reason gbs can be defined as para-infectious neurological disease 4 sars-cov-2 nervous tissue damage can be both related to the direct neuroinvasive action through direct binding with ace-2 receptors 24 and to an indirect injury of the immune system in the latter case the mechanism of immune-mediated damage can be due both to an overactivation of the immune system with hyperproduction of interleukin-6 and to the generation of an autoimmune reaction 18 the infectious bacterial agents classically associated with gbs are campylobacter jejuni which is the most frequent mycoplasma pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae cytomegalovirus epstein-barr virus and influenza-a virus are the most involved viral pathogens 9 cases associated with hepatitis e virus infection and measle infection have also rarely been found 25 26 in 2015 and 2016 cases of gbs related to the zika virus were also reported 10 27 in addition recent evidence reported some cases of gbs in covid-19 patients to the point of speculating a possible association between the acute polyradiculopathy and sars-cov-2 infection 1023 28 29 post-infectious refers to patients with gbs arisen once the sars-cov-2 infection has resolved while para-infectious if gbs occurred during covid-19 14 in our case the respiratory clinic slightly preceded the appearance of neurological symptoms while the pulmonary laboratory and radiological positivity to sars-cov-2 accompanied the whole clinical course of gbs to have an almost parallel resolution these data are suggestive for a para-infectious mechanism as well described in the literature gbs is an immune-mediated disorder due to a molecular mimicry mechanism 9 however a real verification of the production of specific antibodies against gangliosides present on the surface of the nerve myelin sheaths is still lacking 12 for this reason further studies are needed to better clarify the pathophysiological mechanism of gbs in patients with covid-19 the diagnosis of sars-cov-2-related gbs in our patient was supported by a series of laboratory findings associated with the incipient clinic and electrophysiological data in particular the serologies of the most common pathogens associated with gbs such as campylobacter jejuni mycoplasma pneumoniae salmonella enterica cytomegalovirus epstein-barr virus herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 varicella-zoster virus influenza virus a and b and human immunodeficiency virus were negative antibody tests for gbs-associated autoimmune diseases eg ana anti-dna c-anca p-anca were also negative furthermore in support of gbs diagnosis we observed a marked albuminocytologic dissociation however we cannot prove with certainty that a covid-19 para-infectious aidp subtype of gbs has occurred as the sensitivity rt-pcr test of the oropharyngeal swab is suboptimal 14 furthermore some rarer but endemic northern italy infectious agents that can be related to para-infectious gbs such as west nile virus and toscana virus have not been tested 14 besides adequate paraneoplastic screening was not performed and antiganglioside antibodies were not studied despite this based on the anamnestic laboratory neurophysiological and clinical data collected we can support the correlation between the onset of gbs and covid-19 in line with emerged data of the literature review while it is well known that sars-cov-2 correlates with respiratory and gastrointestinal manifestations systemic and neurological involvement is still being studied the case we described of gbs in a covid-19 patient adds to those already reported in the literature in support of sars-cov-2 triggering of gbs the aim of this work is to shed more light on the neurological manifestations of covid-19 not as a corollary of classic respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms but as sars-cov-2-related standalone clinical entities to date it is essential for all specialists clinicians and surgeons to direct attention towards the study of this virus in order to clarify the spectrum of its neurological manifestations  identification of repurposal drugs and adverse drug reactions for various courses of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 based on single-cell rna sequencing data kai guo zhihan wang qinqin pu min wu   canhua huang junguk hur  with more than 38 million people infected coronavirus disease 2019  caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 poses a critical threat to human health there is no proven vaccine or specific drug to date which highlights the urgent need for rapid development of therapeutics for covid-19 to identify potentially repurposable drugs we employed a systematic approach to mine candidates from us fda approved drugs and pre-clinical small-molecule compounds by integrating the gene expression perturbation data by chemicals from the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures lincs project with publically available single-cell rna sequencing dataset from mild and severe covid-19 patients we identified 281 fda approved drugs that have the potential to be effective against sars-cov-2 infection 10 of which are currently undergoing clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy against covid-19 in conclusion we have identified a list of repurposable anti-sars-cov-2 drugs using a systems biology approach  coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease resulting from a life-threatening novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 it has spread rapidly throughout the globe causing 38 million infections and 260 thousand of deaths by early may 2020 1 2  sars-cov-2 is an enveloped rna virus that belongs to the genus betacoronavirus of the family coronaviridae which includes well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov as well as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 3  the advancement in the management of these coronaviruses and other viruses like influenza virus h1n1 and ebola infections have provided insight into treating covid-19 more than 300 active clinical trials for covid-19 are being performed 4 5  chloroquine 6 7 and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine 8  lopinavirritonavir 9 10 11  and remdesivir 7 12  developed for treating malaria human immunodeficiency virus hiv and ebola virus respectively have provided some benefits to treat covid-19 and are being tested in ongoing trials although covid-19 is less fatal than the sars and mers older patients with comorbidities tend to experience more severe symptoms making them more vulnerable the majority of sars-cov-2 infected patients displayed mild symptoms and generally have a good prognosis classified as mild covid-19 9 13  however a large proportion of patients especially among older men with underlying chronic diseases have rapidly progressed to severe covid-19 and suffered from respiratory distress requiring emergent medical interventions 14  unfortunately there is no evidence from randomized clinical trials supporting vaccines or efficient treatment for covid-19 4 5  additionally recent studies have shown the important roles of host immune responses in protection and the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections for instance sars-cov mers-cov and influenza a viruses 15 16  liao et al 17 reported that increased immune cell recruitment in covid-19 patients suggested a crucial role of cd8  t cells in successful viral control and proposed support therapeutic strategies that target the myeloid cell compartment to treat covid-19-associated inflammation however little is known about drug screens of disease-relevant cell types drug repurposing is an essential and universal strategy in the development of new drugs 18  it may facilitate the discovery of new mechanisms of action for existing drugs which is less time-consuming and cost-effective let alone the existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution 19 20  considering that an rna virus exhibits a considerable degree of sequence variation drugs targeting host factors may cause less mutational resistance with more effective and broad anti-virus spectrum potential hence there is an urgent need to identify potential therapeutics with new strategies for emerging infectious diseases and repurposing clinically assessed drugs represents one of the most practicable strategies for the rapid identification of treatments to combat covid-19 in this study we analyzed a publicly available single-cell rna sequencing scrna-seq dataset of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf collected from mild and severe cases as well as bulk rna-seq of balf in covid-19 patients from different experiments  figure 1  data mining was performed by using the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures lincs 21  a drug perturbation database to identify potential therapies for covid-19 disease a total of 281 candidates of different courses of covid-19 independent of cell subtypes were identified 10 of which were in clinical trials of covid-19 including lopinavirritonavir 22  dexamethasone niclosamide lenalidomide hydrocortisone metformin atorvastatin sildenafil and verapamil subsequently we utilized the side effect prediction based on l1000 sep-l1000 project to predict adverse drug reactions adrs and constructed drug-adr association 23 24  our findings may aid in the rapid preclinical and clinical evaluation of these therapeutics and can provide an important drug discovery pipeline to accelerate and facilitate the development of potential treatments for covid-19 the gene-barcode matrix files of all 6 donors containing 3 mild cases and 3 severe cases lung balf and 3 healthy control lung tissues were downloaded from the ncbi gene expression omnibus database accession id gse145926 17  all expression matrices were loaded in r statistical analysis platform using seurat v3 25 and keeping cells with gene number between 200 and 6000 unique molecular identifier umi count above 1000 and mitochondrial gene percentage below 01 a total of 43914 cells collected from three healthy subjects three mild covid-19 patients and three severe covid-19 patients were used for the analyses we also collected a list of differentially expressed genes degs in sars-cov-2-infected lung balf using a bulk rna-seq analysis to compare against the single-cell-based data this deg list was obtained from the chinese national genomics data center httpsbigdbigaccn accession id cra002390 26  the lognormalize method in seurat was used for normalizing filtered gene-barcode matrix principal component analysis pca was done by using the top 2000 most variable genes then uniform manifold approximation and projection umap was performed on the top 50 principal components for visualizing the cells and graph-based clustering was performed on the pcareduced data with seurat v3 27  mast in seurat v3 was used to perform differential analysis degs were identified by comparing each cluster between all of the three groups genes with average log2fc  025 and adjusted p-value  005 were deemed as degs degs were first sorted by the log2fc values and then the upregulated and downregulated genes were chosen to identify drugs and compounds against the lincs database using the connectivity map linked user environment clue platform 21  the drug connectivity score cs with a negative value smaller than -90 was used to determine candidate drugs and compounds covid-19 database from the international clinical trials registry platform ictrp httpswwwwhointictrpen updated on may 5 th  2020 was searched for clinical trials information associated with these drugs both on-label and off-label adverse drug reactions adrs of the candidate drugs were collected from the sep-l1000 database httpsmaayanlabnetsep-l1000 the sep-l1000 data include on-label adrs of fda-approved drugs collected from sider 28 and off-label adrs from the pharmgkb database 29 based on the post-marketing adr reports in the fda adverse event report system faers our study highlighted the identification of different therapeutic effects in the varied disease course with the high variability of the cellular compartments underlying disease progression our drug repurposing profiles from major cell subtypes included t b and nk cells macrophages and epithelial cells a total of 9 scrna-seq balf samples including 3 healthy cases 3 mild cases and 3 severe cases were collected from publicly available scrna-seq data supplemental table s1  after quality filtering approximately 250000 gene expression values from 44000 cells were collected the clustering analysis identified six major clusters of macrophage nk figure s1  which was determined based on the unique signature genes cd68 macrophage cell il7r and cd4 cd4 t cell cd8a cd8 t cell ms4a1 b cells tppp3 epithelial cells respectively supplemental figure s2  we then compared these six major clusters across the healthy mild and severe covid-19 cases and identified differentially expressed genes between any of the two courses supplemental tables s2-s4  connecting to the lincs database of small-molecule perturbations on gene expression we identified candidate drugs and compounds that can reverse these upregulated and downregulated genes via the clue platform

inform clinical decisions regarding treatments for covid-19 covid-19 has spread rapidly and no proven vaccine or drug has yet been identified to treat it generally speaking there are several ways to control or prevent emerging coronavirus disease including antivirals small-molecule drugs biologics and vaccines 4 5  due to the lack of effective therapeutic agents and long development cycles of vaccines it is therefore reasonable to consider repurposing existing drugs and compounds for covid-19 drug repurposing is a potentially important strategy for the discovery of existing medicines to

differed in mild and severe disease courses more t and nk cells decreased in severe cases but cd8  t cells increased in mild cases however drug screening of disease-relevant cell types is still unclear here we analyzed publicly available data of covid-19 patients and performed data mining by using the lincs l1000 database to identify potential therapies for covid-19 disease and sep-l1000 database to predict side effects our approach is different from previous methods for drug repurposing for coronavirus since it does not merely rapidly identify likely effective therapeutic agents in preventing or treating covid-19 but tries to filter out specific medications during the patients disease courses furthermore the data and transcriptome are derived from human samples from real patients two independent sets of experiments lastly we explore the underlying risk factors associated with some side effects of the candidates overall our data will guide the future development of therapies for the different durations of covid-19 and other viral respiratory infections this study has several limitations to note first the public scrna-seq data had a small number of clinical samples n9 without available patient information which makes comparisons between studies difficult with the fast pace and expected large number of published literature using other patient samples our candidate lists may need to be revised second our findings may not apply to children because all the sequencing data were from adults future work on large-scale data mining would help us in better identification of antiviral drugs the pandemic of covid-19 represents the greatest global public health crisis in this generation so far no proven vaccines and therapies have been identified based on the study we thoroughly investigated potential candidates for the treatment in covid-19 progression and predicted some possible adverse effects the findings can guide additional repurposing studies

camilla bjrkman claudia von brmssen karin troell catarina svensson   diarrhea is a significant health problem in young calves and the protozoan parasite cryptosporidium parvum is one of the major infectious causes of calf diarrhea worldwide blanchard 2012 thomson et al 2017 clinical cryptosporidiosis is mostly seen in calves up to six weeks of age and the most prominent clinical symptoms are watery diarrhea inappetence depression and sometimes death robertson et al 2014 co-infection with other pathogens or presence of non-infectious diarrheal causes can lead to more severe disease oocysts the infective stage of the parasite are excreted with the faeces and an infected individual can shed millions of oocysts per gram faeces uga et al 2000 silverls et al 2013 hence the infection load can rapidly increase and become very high in the herd in studies comprising dairy calves up to two months of age 593 of investigated calves shed cryptosporidium spp oocysts santn et al 2004 silverls et al 2009b wang et al 2011 rieux et al 2013 and the cumulative prevalence can be 100 in some herds ohandley et al 1999 santn et al 2004 c parvum is zoonotic and there are several reports of humans being diseased after contact with infected calves eg robertson et al 2006 grinberg et al 2011 kinross et al 2015 over the years several substances have been tested for potential anti-cryptosporidial effects in livestock but with limited success halofuginone lactate has shown some beneficial effects but does not completely prevent or cure disease silverls et al 2009a almawly et al 2013 meganck et al 2015 thus sanitation is still the most important tool in disease prevention however the parasite is resistant to all commonly used chemical disinfectants making it particularly difficult to control fayer 2008 hydrated lime or calcium hydroxide can be used to sanitise animal facilities from bacteria and viruses kristula et al 2008 anonymous 2009 it has been shown that hydrated lime decreases the viability of c parvum in the laboratory zintl et al 2010 and when hydrated lime disinfection of the calf pens was used as a complement to the standard cleaning procedures in two swedish herds with long-lasting cryptosporidiosis problems the farmers reported a lower incidence and less severe diarrhea in the calves c axn personal communication recently matsuura et al 2017 reported about a successful sanitation of a herd that for about 10 years had experienced severe calf diarrhea problems due to mixed c parvum and giardia intestinalis infections they emptied the calf stable removed bedding and faecal matter let the pens dry for several days and then washed them with boiling water coated them with milk of lime and exchanged all wooden boards dividing the pens during the two-year period following the sanitation no calves died and no c parvum oocysts or g intestinalis cysts were found matsuura et al 2017 this indicates that hydrated lime disinfection might be an effective control measure in cattle herds the aim of this study was to investigate if disinfection of calf pens with hydrated lime would decrease contamination of c parvum oocysts and improve calf health in herds with c parvum associated diarrhea problems four herds were recruited to this cohort study inclusion criteria were that i the herd had a prevailing calf diarrhea problem for at least two months ii more than 20 of the calves developed diarrhea before three weeks of age and iii c parvum but not rotavirus or coronavirus had been detected in calves from the herd furthermore the herd should not use hydrated lime or other chemicals for disinfection of the calf pens and the design of the calf facilities should allow arrangement of calf pens into a treatment and a control section preferably the calves should be housed individually until they reached four weeks but at least until two weeks of age potential experimental herds were identified by field veterinarians at vxa sverige an advisory and ai service company with knowledge about calf health in dairy herds in the different regions of sweden based on clinical findings and laboratory diagnostic results the field veterinarians considered c parvum to be the main cause of the diarrhea problem in these herds only herds that fulfilled all requirements were included in the study several herds had to be excluded because they already used hydrated lime and few herds kept their calves in individual pens longer than one week owners of potential experimental herds were interviewed by one of the authors cs about management and health of the pre-weaned calves using a predefined questionnaire before it was finally decided if a herd could be included faecal samples were collected from five calves under three weeks of age and analysed for presence of cryptosporidium spp rotavirus and coronavirus only herds in which cryptosporidium spp but no rotavirus or coronavirus was found were accepted each of the four herds participated in the study over six to seven months and was visited by a project veterinarian every second month ie four times during this period at the first visit the magnitude of the calf diarrhea problem and the feeding and cleaning routines were recorded the veterinarian and the farmer together decided how the penshuts used for newborn calves should be divided into experimental and control areas and how the calves should be distributed between the pens in herds one to three cleaning routines meant that all penshuts forming one row in the stable were cleaned at the same time in these herds three to nine consecutively born calves were therefore allocated to experimental and control penshuts respectively in herd four every other calf born was put in an experimental and a control pen respectively the farmers themselves decided which area was used as experimental and control this was as far as possible kept unknown to the veterinarian the farmers were instructed to clean all penshuts according to their usual farm routine before a new calf was entered in the experimental penshuts a thin layer of hydrated lime should then be spread onto the walls and floor the recommendation was to use no more than 40 g hydrated lime to coat both floor and walls of a 15m2 pen farmers were instructed to apply the lime while the surface was still damp after washing in order to allow the lime to attach to the walls if the farm routine did not include cleaning using water a small volume of water was to be sprinkled onto the walls and floor before the hydrated lime was applied the lime was allowed to work for a minimum of 24 h and farmers were instructed to brush the walls before the penhut was bedded and a new calf introduced the control pens were to be left empty for at least 24 h after cleaning before a new calf was entered ethics approval for this study was granted by the regional ethical review board in uppsala reference number c15914 for each calf born during the study period farmers were requested to record the identity number date of birth breed sex date when the calf was separated from the dam and moved to an individual pen whether it was kept in an experimental or control pen and the date the calf was moved from the individual pen to a group pen if a calf developed diarrhea they were requested to record the date when the diarrhea was first observed the length of the disease period if the diarrhea was accompanied by decreased general condition andor decreased appetite if the calf received any treatment and if it was euthanised or died at each of the four visits the project veterinarian performed clinical examinations scored the body condition and collected faecal samples all calves up to four weeks of age were clinically examined

group respectively samples were taken directly from the rectum at the first and fourth visits blood samples were also collected from five 27 day old calves for analysis of serum protein as an estimate of the colostrum management in the herd one gram of each faecal sample was cleaned and concentrated by a saturated sodium chloride flotation method and analysed for cryptosporidium oocysts by epifluorescence microscopy as described by silverls et al 2009b the entire wells were examined by epifluorescence microscopy and oocysts enumerated at 200x magnification an animal was considered cryptosporidium positive if at least one oocyst was detected in the microscope the lower detection limit of this method is 50 oocysts per gram of faeces opg all cryptosporidium positive samples collected at the first and fourth visits were analysed further to determine species and c parvum subtype dna was extracted using the powerlyzer powersoildna isolation kit mo bio laboratories cat no 12855-s according to the manufacturers recommendations but with the following modifications up to 2 ml of each cleaned sample was spun down at 13000 rpm for three minutes in an eppendorf centrifuge and the pellet dissolved in 750 l bead solution the solution was transferred to the glass bead tube and 60 l solution c1 was added the tubes were briefly vortexed and incubated at 100 c in a thermal block for 10 min followed by bead beating using a mp fast prep 24 bead beater set at 65 ms for one minute finally the dna was eluted in 80 l solution c6 a nested pcr protocol for partial amplification

cycler primers for the 18s amplification were as described in santn et al 2004 samples containing c parvum were subtyped through partial amplification 800 bp of the 60-kda glycoprotein gp60 gene using the same pcr mixture as for 18s but with primers described in alves et al 2003 18s reaction conditions were 95 c for three minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 30 s 61 c for 30 s and 72 c for 30

ncbi httpwwwncbinlmnihgovblastblastcgi analyses for rotavirus and coronavirus were performed at the diagnostic laboratory at the swedish national veterinary institute up to five samples are pooled at

analyses serum protein was analysed by refractometer data were entered and edited in microsoft office excel 2010 spreadsheets 2010 microsoft corporation results presented in the text are original not modeled data statistical analyses were performed with generalised linear mixed models using sas version 94 sas institute inc cary nc usa with the binary variable of whether or not a calf was kept in a hydrated lime disinfected pen as the main predictor herd was included as a random variable in all models sex was initially included as a fixed variable but had a negligible effect and is therefore not presented in the final results breed and housing ie pen or hut were excluded from the models as they were associated with herd results were considered significant when p  005 for farmer recorded data the association between whether or not a calf was kept in a hydrated lime disinfected pen and the binary outcome variable presence of diarrhea was investigated by using a generalised linear mixed model with a binomial distribution for the response ie a logistic regression model the continuous outcome variables age at diarrhea onset and days with diarrhea were investigated assuming a normal distribution for the error term as the residuals for the analysis of days with diarrhea did not follow a normal distribution data were log-transformed before analysis the assumption of normality and equal variances was checked by appropriate residual plots a variable severity was created by combining the farmers records of presence of diarrhea and whether the diarrhea had been accompanied by decreased general condition andor decreased appetite the severity variable had three categories 1  diarrhea but general condition or appetite not affected 2  diarrhea and decreased general condition or decreased appetite and 3  diarrhea and decreased general condition and decreased appetite therefore a proportional odds model was used to model the probabilities to fall in any of these categories when the pen was hydrated lime disinfected or not for veterinary recorded data general condition data were categorised into 0 normal and 1 affected including all records 0 dehydration into 0 normal and 1 dehydrated including all records 0 and faecal consistency into 0 normal including records 0  sausage-like and 1  porridge-like and 1 diarrhea including records 2  gruel-like and 3  watery these variables were investigated by logistic regression models body condition score was investigated by general linear models glm i e assuming normally distributed errors the variables oocyst concentration ie opg and oocyst level 45000 opg were investigated by glm on log-transformed data and a logistic regression model respectively the second variable was created because it has been suggested that 45000 opg might be a suitable cut off to distinguish clinical cryptosporidiosis and subclinical infection operario et al 2015 differences between serum protein values in first and fourth visits and between herds respectively were tested in a two-way anova without random factors information obtained by interviewing the owners of the four herds before the study started is presented in table 1
 the calves were usually kept with their dam for up to 24 h and then moved to individual pens or huts two herds had pens one had huts and one had both pens and huts where they were kept for two to four weeks until moved and mixed with other calves in group pens or huts in all four herds the calf diarrhea problems had been ongoing for several years and the farmers estimated the morbidity among 060 day old calves to be 33100 over the last six months caretakers gave colostrum manually in all herds except in herd four in which some of the calves suckled their first colostrum in total 422 calves were born during the study period of which 20 were excluded either because the farmers records were not complete or because the pen had not been kept empty for 24 h before the calf was introduced thus 402 calves were finally included in the study of these 196 and 206 were kept in hydrated lime disinfected pens and control pens respectively the farmers recordings are presented in table 2
 overall the farmers detected diarrhea in 214 53 of the calves with similar proportions in experimental and control pens the mean age when diarrhea was first seen was 83 days range 123 days and it lasted for 39 days on average median 3 days age at diarrhea onset was significantly p  0001 higher in experimental pens than in control pens 90 days and 76 days respectively there was no significant difference between calves kept in experimental and control pens for the variables presence of diarrhea days with diarrhea or severity table 2 appendix table i veterinarians examined 156 calves ie all calves that were up to four weeks old at the time of the visits there was no significant difference in the veterinary registrations regarding either general appearance dehydration or faecal consistency between calves kept in experimental pens or control pens appendix table ii body condition was scored for 55 calves at two to four weeks of age and from 54 calves at six to eight weeks of age mean scores for calves from experimental and control pens respectively were 30 range 2040 and 29 range 2040 at two to four weeks and 31 range 2540 and 29 range 2035 at six to eight weeks the six to eight week old calves kept in experimental pens had a significantly higher body condition score p  00069 than calves in control pens but the difference between the groups in the younger calves was not significant appendix table iii faecal samples were collected from 95 calves cryptosporidium positive samples were found at all samplings in all four herds cryptosporidium spp was detected in 79 83 samples and oocyst counts were 50126  106 opg with a median of 52350 opg in the positive samples there was no difference between experimental or control pens in either the variables oocyst concentration or oocyst level 45000 opg table 3
 appendix table iv when the cryptosporidium positive samples from the first and fourth samplings n  52 were analysed by molecular biology methods the species could be determined in 49 samples c parvum was the dominant species found in 45 samples c bovis was found in four samples two different c parvum subtypes were found iiaa16g1r1b in three herds and iiaa16g1r1bvariant in one herd table 4 only one subtype was found in each herd rotavirus was found in all the herds and in pools from both experimental and control calves in total 32 pools 8 from each herd were analysed and rotavirus was found in 11 34 of them coronavirus was not found in any pool the mean serum protein value was 584 gl range 4670 gl with no significant differences between the first and fourth visits 593 and 561 p  0244 or between herds p  0290 in this study performed in dairy herds with pervasive c parvumassociated calf diarrhea problems calves kept in the hydrated lime disinfected pens were older when diarrhea was first recorded and had a higher body condition score at six to eight weeks of age no other significant differences between calves kept in the experimental and control pens were observed by farmers or veterinarians in disinfected and control pens the mean age at diarrhea onset was 90 and 76 days respectively although the difference between the groups is small it is clinically relevant and represents a significant improvement in herds with pervasive diarrhea problems body condition score in calves is an easily accessible but rough estimate of body condition and was used as a measure of disease severity the significantly higher body condition score in the calves in disinfected pens at 68 weeks of age indicates that the disease was less severe in these calves that no difference was recorded at 23 weeks of age may be due to the fact that several calves got diarrhea at a late stage the diarrhea onset varied from 1 and 23 days of age 
c parvum and rotavirus are the two predominate infectious causes of diarrhea in young calves in sweden whereas coronavirus is found sporadically and e coli f5 is an uncommon pathogen bjrkman et al 2003 torsein et al 2011 all herds were suggested to the study by field veterinarians who had identified cryptosporidium spp as the main pathogen associated with the diarrhea problems when we sampled the four herds before including them in the study we detected no rotavirus or coronavirus in any of them all four herds did however show the presence of cryptosporidium spp during the study cryptosporidium spp oocysts were found in a high proportion of the samples 83 at all four sampling points for all the herds rotavirus was also found but only a one-third of the sample pools were positive together this suggest that c parvum was the major pathogen but that coinfection with rotavirus might have contributed to the diarrhea lime has been shown to decrease the viability of oocysts of c parvum zintl et al 2010 however we found no difference in oocyst shedding between calves kept in the experimental and control pens this might be due to the study design in which faecal samples were taken at veterinary visits scheduled every two months this sampling schedule was therefore not optimised in relation to either diarrhea occurrence or potential oocyst excretion patterns we also note that for practical reasons the lime was mostly left to react for only 24 h whereas the shortest time used by zintl et al 2010 was 48 h disinfection might have been more effective if the lime had been allowed to react for 48 h in the study pens the infection dose of c parvum is very low 25 oocysts have been reported to induce clinical infections in neonatal calves zambriski et al 2013 in problem herds we can suspect a particularly high infection load which is a challenge to any disinfectants furthermore zintl et al 2010 concluded that in order to avoid reinfection disinfection would have to be repeated at times when the pens were unoccupied in the present study disinfection was repeated and each pen was unoccupied when coated however the barns were not emptied and cleaned before the start of lime disinfection lime disinfection was only added as a complement to the ordinary cleaning routines and was started during the housing season when the infection load was already high cleaning routines and the quality of the equipment in the calf barns varied among the experimental herds for example in one herd the pens were not cleaned with water between each calf and in another herd the boards dividing the pens were worn and difficult to clean it has been suggested that components in cattle faeces enhance the oocysts resistance to environmental stress robertson et al 1992 and remnants of faecal material might have impaired the effect of the lime we could speculate that the disinfection might have been more effective if the barn had been vacated thoroughly cleaned and allowed to dry for several days before the start of lime disinfection as described by matsuura et al 2017 lime has also been found to be effective in reducing rotavirus contamination hansen et al 2007 in the present study an inclusion criterion was that no rotavirus had been detected on the farm however the samplings taken during the course of the study revealed presence of this virus in all herds the study design did not permit determination of the significance of this infection in the herds the passive protection obtained by a high uptake of antibodies from maternal colostrum is essential to combating disease in young calves total protein content in blood serum can be used to estimate colostrum uptake concentrations below 55 gl are considered to indicate failure of passive transfer tyler et al 1999 in contrast higher concentrations are associated with improved calf health waldner and rosengren 2009 furman-fratczak et al 2011 although the mean serum protein value was above 55 gl at both serum samplings all herds had individual calves with lower total protein values and only 5 of 27 calves had igg values above 60 gl indicating suboptimal colostrum feeding that may have rendered the calves particularly susceptible to cryptosporidial infections in agreement with a previous study on calves from swedish herds with ongoing cryptosporidium-associated calf diarrhea problems silverls et al 2013 c parvum was the dominant species and c bovis was only found in a few samples however in swedish herds without diarrhea problems c bovis is the major species seen in young calves silverls et al 2010 silverls and blanco-penedo 2013 the c parvum subtype iiaa16g1r1b that was found in three of the herds is the most common subtype in sweden both in cattle and in humans it was for example the subtype involved in a recent outbreak among veterinary students in sweden genbank eu647728 kinross et al 2015 the iiaa16g1r1bvariant is not as common and is slightly different from iiaa16g1r1b the tcg repeat is in a different position in the repeat region it was first seen in sweden in 2015 when it was identified in children who had fallen sick after visiting dairy herds at public events held on the occasion of letting the cows out on pasture for the first time in spring anonymous 2016 the sequence is published genbank kt8953681 disinfection of calf pens with slaked lime delayed the onset of diarrhea and improved the body condition of the calves but did not affect diarrhea incidence or duration although lime disinfection alone will not be sufficient to control cryptosporidium-associated diarrhea in herds with extensive calf diarrhea problems these results suggest that it can be a valuable complement to other measures declarations of interest none

present with flulike symptoms boivin et al 2002 walsh et al 2008 but high morbidity is observed in the elderly and immunocompromised patients larcher et al 2005 kahn 2006 the viral rna of hmpv is approximately 13 kb in length including eight genes that code for nine different proteins van den hoogen et al 2002 feuillet et al 2012 based on genetic differences hmpv isolates are separated into two genotypes a and b with each genotype subdivided into two subtypes 1 and 2 van den hoogen et al 2004 subtype a2 is further divided in two genetic lineage a2a and a2b huck et al 2006 hmpv has a seasonal distribution with peak incidence in winter and spring kahn 2006 mizuta et al 2013 its circulation may vary each season and different genotypes can circulate simultaneously in variable proportions mackay et al 2006 gaunt et al 2009 pitoiset et al 2010 li et al 2012b most existing studies of hmpv infection were focused on hospitalized children kahn 2006 feuillet et al 2012 however epidemiological survey of outpatients is of unique importance for a comprehensive understanding of the current circulation pattern and clinical burden and for developing control strategies a national influenza surveillance system which tracks influenzalike illness ili was launched in china in 2001 yang et al 2009b clinical samples of ili patients are collected by sentinel hospitals every calendar week in the present study specimens from children with ili were utilized to explore the circulation and epidemiology of hmpv in wuhan the largest city in central china which has a resident population over 10 million realtime rtpcr assay was employed to evaluate the prevalence of hmpv infection and phylogenetic characteristics of hmpv isolates were also investigated the childrens hospital of wuhan was selected to be the study site from july 2008 to december 2013 since it is the largest public paediatric centre in the city as well as a national influenza sentinel hospital young ili patients presenting at the hospital clinic were diagnosed according to the following definition the sudden onset of fever 38c with cough or sore throat in absence of other diagnoses world health organization 1999 ilipositive children were excluded if they 1 were older than 15 years of age 2 had fever for more than 3 days and 3 had been treated with antiviral drugs during the 55 year study period a total of 3883 patients were recruited about 1015 eligible subjects were enrolled per week based on random selection of physicians except for the period between august 2009 and september 2010 when inclusion number was doubled for the reason of 2009 influenza pandemic after verbal informed consent was obtained from parents or caretakers throat swabs were collected from study participants in 25 ml viral transport medium and were delivered to wuhan centers for disease prevention and control for laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viruses since the sentinel surveillance of ili cases is covered by chinese legislation law on the prevention and control of infectious diseases article 17 and no extra sample was obtained for the study ethic committee approval was not required nucleic acids were

human rhinovirus human adenovirus human coronavirus and human bocavirus for patient samples shown to be hmpv positive rtpcr was employed to amplify the viral gene segments for genotyping and phylogenetic analysis a previously described set of primers targeting at a 506 bp fragment of fusion protein f gene was used huck et al 2006 retrotranscription and amplification were performed using qiagen onestep rtpcr kit qiagen germany and the amplified fragments were purified and sequenced at sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china using an abi 3730xl dna analyzer the genbank accession numbers

supplementary table s1 using clustalx2 larkin et al 2007 and alignments were edited manually with bioedit software further phylogenetic analyses were performed on a 489bp f gene segment nt 5741062 neighborjoining nj tree of f gene was estimated using mega software version 505 tamura et al 2011 with tamura 3parameter model of nucleotide substitution as it gave the lowest bic bayesian information criterion scores gaps were treated by pairwise deletion and substitution rates were defined as uniform among sites but different among lineages to confirm the robustness and reliability of the branching orders 1000 bootstraps were performed on the neighborjoining tree additional phylogenetic testing of the dataset was the maximum likelihood ml analysis performed by using iqpnni important quartet puzzling and nearest neighbor interchange version 332 minh et al 2005 the hasegawakishinoyano hky85 model was used for ml tree generation while substitution rates and base frequencies were estimated from data by the software the numbers of iterations were twice of the sequence number of dataset evolutionary distances within and between different clades were calculated by using the mega 505 in addition sequence identity within hmpv samples identified in this study and between samples and contemporary circulating strains all over the world were estimated genomes of 23 hmpv strains collected after 2002 were obtained from niaid virus pathogen database and analysis resource vipr pickett et al 2012 and served as reference sequences of contemporary circulating strains supplementary

spss chicago il categorical variables were compared by the 2test for continuous variables kruskalwallis test were employed after determining the normality of their distributions by kolmogorovsmirnov test a pvalue of less than 005 was considered statistically significant a total of 3883 ili patients ranging from 1 month to 15 years old median age 34 months mean age 45 months were enrolled in this study of whom 531 were male and 469 were female table i hmpv rna was detected in 440 1713883 of all patient specimens and in 737 1461981 of specimens that tested negative for other respiratory viruses the whole detection rate of hmpv was lower than that of influenza virus 232 rhinovirus 827 parainfluenza virus 621 respiratory syncytial virus 574 and adenovirus 515 but higher than that of human coronavirus 337 and bocavirus 095 coinfection was observed in 25 hmpv rna positive samples among which three samples have been shown to be positive for three different respiratory viruses pathogens most frequently coinfected with hmpv were influenza virus nine cases and rhinovirus six cases the hmpv rna positive patients included 99 males and 72 females with a male female ratio of 13751 2  1649 p  0199 chisquare test the age range of those patients was 6 months to 13 years median age 28 months mean age 32 months over 90 of hmpv rna positive children were under 5 years old 2  3232 p  0001 chisquare test and the highest prevalence rate occurred in the group aged 3 years old which was 791 45569 fig 1a hmpv was detected in every season during the study period as expected the virus circulated predominantly in winter and spring with 801 of the identified infections occurring between december and may fig 1b a biennial alternation between high and low incidence was observed during the study fig 1c hmpv presented a highlevel activity in the first two epidemic seasons of 431 ili patient samples collected in the epidemic season 20082009 31 719 were identified as hmpv rna positive seasonal peak occurred from november through february and the highest detection rate was 222 627 february 2009 the yearround positive rate of the epidemic season 20092010 was 628 681082 peak circulation of hmpv in this season delayed to spring and early summer march to june with a highest monthly positive rate of 325 2680 in april 2010 in the next two epidemic seasons however the prevalence of hmpv became much lower the detection rates in seasons 20102011 and 20112012 were 127 11863 and 252 13516 respectively hmpvpositive cases were distributed sporadically with no notable circulation peak a rise of hmpv detection occurred in the last period of study the yearround positive rate of epidemic season 20122013 soared up to 741 45607 with a highest detection rate of 227 1044 in january 2013 phylogenetic analysis was conducted on the 489 bp amplicons of hmpv f gene amino acid position 192354 of 145 samples identified in this study the other 26 specimens were not subtyped because of the lack of sample unsuccessful amplification or low quality of sequencing as shown in the nj tree all four subtypes of hmpv were detected and the clustering was supported by high bootstrap values 85 of major intersects fig 2 genotype a included 62 specimens except one belonged to subtype a1 all the other 61 samples were classified as subtype a2 and further lineage a2b among genotype b subtype b1 included 42 strains and b2 included 41 strains notably sequences of consecutive epidemic seasons were clustered in the clade of b1 also there were two clusters in b2 clade that each was comprised by multiple identical or closely related sequences of one epidemic season 20092010 and 20122013 respectively ml analysis revealed similar tree topology with the nj tree data not shown sample sequences identified in this study shared high homology with sequences of contemporary circulating strains from all over the world at both nucleotide level and amino acid level table ii evolutionary distances within groups suggested b2 was more heterogeneous than other hmpv subtypes nucleotide distance 0011 amino acid distance 0004 and the nucleotide distance between groups showed that clade b2 was slightly more distant from genotype a than clade b1 0163 vs 0158 except subtype a1 that only one case had been identified all other hmpv subtypes were found to share similar population distribution more male patients than female and the majority of patients were under 3year old there was no significant difference among four subtypes in their gender 2  5320 p  0504 chisquare test and age distribution 2  0495 p  0920 kruskalwallis test genotypes a and b circulated simultaneously during the observation except the last half year when only subtype b2 was detected changes in the predominant genotype occurred in 13 years interval table iii subtype a2 was prevailed in epidemic seasons 20082009 and 20122013 and b1 was the predominant subtype during epidemic seasons 20092010 to 20112012 following by b2 the single a1 strain was detected in epidemic season 20122013 to discover the epidemiological and molecular features of hmpv infection in wuhan we screened 3883 respiratory samples from ili outpatients under 16 years of age that were collected over a period of five and half consecutive years hmpv was detected in 171 samples giving a positive rate of 440 similar frequencies have been reported among the germen paediatric outpatients with ili 399 reiche et al 2014 and arti children in beijing china 402 zhu et al 2011 whereas influenza surveillance system in northern greece has detected a higher incidence in ili outpatients during season 20052008 128 in age group 05 years 736 in age group 018 years gioula et al 2010 the present study was very much facilitated by the existing ili surveillance which continuously collects clinical samples from outpatients with respiratory issues however it also caused potential sampling bias as fever is not a typical clinical manifestation of hmpv in children reiche et al 2014 according to the surveillance definition of ili only febrile patients were sampled thereby increasing the likelihood of underestimating hmpv circulation no gender preference was found in the study interestingly although hmpv infection in wuhan occurred more frequently in children under the age of five as expected the highest prevalence was in children aged between 2 and 4 years not in younger infants like many previous studies described van den hoogen et al 2001 williams et al 2004 lambert et al 2007 zhu et al 2011 one explanation is that the risk of exposure is higher among children between 2 and 4 because they are just entering kindergartens in this age the observation might also be related to the higher virulence of hmpv in infants and young children boivin et al 2002 the virus has been demonstrated to be second only to rsv as a cause of bronchiolitis in early childhood kahn 2006 which leads to substantial proportion of hospitalization of younger patients children above 2 years old on the other hand are more immunocompetent and are more likely to become outpatient rather than be hospitalized during a hmpv infection the majority of hmpv positive cases were diagnosed at the end of winter and early spring which is the typical epidemic season of this virus in temperate zone kahn 2006 however the seasonal distribution of hmpv in wuhan varied in different study years three main epidemic peaks occurred first in the winterspring season in year 20082009 november to february then shifted to the springsummer season in year 20092010 march to june and finally back to the winterspring season in year 20122013 november to march multiple researchers from europe and asia also observed similar biennial shifts between winter and spring seasonality of hmpv a significantly higher prevalence was identified in summer peak in austria aberle et al 2010 in winter peak in japan mizuta et al 2013 but not in beijing zhu et al 2011 or wuhan as shown in this study besides the incidence of hmpv was not even in each season through the study two epidemic seasons with high viral activity were followed by two low activity epidemic seasons and again by a high activity epidemic season the cause of different seasonality and yearly incidence is unclear our data did not support the assumption that circulation of different genotypes resulted in the change of temporal distribution since no correlation was found between a certain hmpv genetic subgroup with high prevalence but the possibility cannot be ruled out that environmental factors and circulation of other respiratory pathogens such as the pandemic of ah1n12009 have affected the epidemical dynamics of hmpv phylogenetic analysis of partial f gene revealed that different hmpv subgroups circulated simultaneously in most time of the study only one genotype was predominant in each epidemic season and the dominance of a certain genotype lasted for one or three seasons such replacement of prevailing genotype is believed to be a random escape from the adaptive immunity of population to the circulating genotype williams et al 2006 aberle et al 2010 pitoiset et al 2010 reiche et al 2014 interestingly a group of researchers from chongqing a city in southwest china has studied the epidemiology of hmpv among hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory tract infections between july 2008 and march 2011 yet they observed quite different seasonal distribution and prevailing genotype from wuhan subtype a2b was predominant during the whole period and peaked in march to may 2009 and november 2010 to february 2011 zhang et al 2012 considering the 800 km linear distance between chongqing and wuhan the difference was likely to be a result of geographic isolation as well as the distinction of study subjects in this study only one sample in epidemic season 20122013 was identified as subtype a1 as a matter of fact a number of studies have observed the absence of a1 in recent years li et al 2012a 2012b velez rueda et al 2013 reiche et al 2014 indicating this subtype has been going through a global trough from 2006 the only exception was an italian study that reported the circulation of subtype a1 was predominant in season 20092010 apostoli et al 2012 the analysis of sequence diversity showed that nucleotide distance within hmpv subtypes was 00070011 and the corresponding amino acid distance was 00000004 such low diversity might be explained by functional constraints on paramyxovirus fusion proteins that prevent progressive antigen drift yang et al 2009a it has been identified that a region between residue 260300 on f1 subunit of fusion protein presents considerable variation yang et al 2009a but no amino acid substitution specific for wuhan strains was noticed in this study there were multiple closely related or even identical sequences from the same epidemic seasons or two consecutive seasons in clades b1 and b2 implicating that hmpv infections due to highly similar viruses within one period at least in genotype b reiche et al 2014 among all detected hmpv positive samples 146 were found to be coinfected by one or two other respiratory viruses this portion of sample was not excluded during data analysis because previous study suggested no significant difference in clinical manifestation and severity between patients with a coinfection and those without kahn 2006 the positive rate of hmpv was lower than those of several other common respiratory viruses among the ili children in wuhan but given the population size represented by the study subjects this moderate rate could mean a large number of respiratory infection cases and significant health burden in summary this is the first longterm study on hmpv infection among ili children in china it shows that metapneumovirus is rather a rare cause of ili in wuhan a higher detection rate in children aged between 2 and 4 years was observed as well as the biennial rhythm of viral seasonality phylogenetic analysis revealed that all subtypes of hmpv were circulated in wuhan yet each genotype prevailed for 13 consecutive seasons strains in wuhan were evolutionally conservative and multiple identical isolates were observed in one season since only limited information about the viruss prevalence and lineage distribution in the outpatient these data improve the understanding of the local hmpv circulation patterns and genetic diversity however further surveillance in adults ili outpatient and inpatient are required to find the missing part of puzzle  molecular detection of infectious bronchitis and avian metapneumoviruses in oman backyard poultry thunai al-shekaili matthew baylis kannan

particular paucity of information from oman with almost no published studies of avian respiratory viruses for any species this is despite omans geographic location between the horn of africa and southern asia its importance as a site for migrating wild birds and the presence of large commercial poultry production farms these farms produce the majority of the omani poultry requirements however census data in 2004 reports there were around 25000 backyard flocks bred for household consumption anon 2004 due to the avian influenza contingency plan implemented between 2004 and 2012 this number has been reduced to nearly 10000 flocks rural women development department personal communication 2012 maintaining a good health status of backyard flocks is crucial for both the flock owners and the owners of nearby commercial flocks mcbride et al 1991 backyard poultry in oman are not vaccinated against ibv or ampv this paper reports the first study on the prevalence of ibv genotypes and ampv subtypes within backyard poultry flocks in oman oropharyngeal swabs were collected from a total of 243 backyard flocks 2317 birds from 237 backyard farms within all regions and governorates of oman fig 1
 from june to september 2012 more than one flock was sampled if the farm had more than one species of bird the samples were collected during a study on the prevalence of respiratory viruses such as avian influenza ai newcastle disease nd ib and ampv the number and location of sampled farms was determined based on the estimated prevalence of avian influenza ai and newcastle disease nd in oman backyard poultry sampling criteria were calculated based on an estimated prevalence of ai of 30 and between-cluster variance of 07 the number of flocks to be sampled was stratified by region according to the number of poultry farms total number of poultry number of people and number of backyard poultry present in each region a confidence level of 95 was utilised along with a two-stage cluster sampling method thrusfield 1986 the total backyard poultry population in oman was estimated by the ministry of agriculture and fisheries department of rural women development to be approximately 10000 poultry flocks table 1
 with a median size of 50 birds per flock the vast majority of the sampled farms raised local village chickens however turkeys guinea fowl duck and geese were also present local veterinarians and animal health engineers from the ministry of agriculture and fisheries in each state aided with the selection of farms at different locations inclusion criteria involved a minimum distance between two farms 1 km and 3 farms from each village if only one flock was present at a farm 10 healthy adult 3 months birds were selected randomly and sampled if more than one species of bird was present in the farm then two flocks would be randomly chosen and 10 birds sampled from each flock if there were fewer than 10 birds within a chosen flock then all were sampled for detection of respiratory viruses oropharyngeal swabs were collected from each flock and pooled into 15 ml distilled water in a sterile 5 ml plastic bijou container all samples were kept cool in crushed ice within a thermal-box and

reference sequences with default settings and 1000 bootstrap re-sampling blast was utilised for nucleotide and amino acid identity comparisons between representative isolates within identified clusters from the total of 243 flocks sampled during the study five tested ampv positive 206 all five samples were from chickens and all were identified as ampv subtype b the positive samples came from northern regions of oman three from the ad dhahirah region albrimi ibri and dank one from the ash sharqiyah region snaw and the fifth from the muscat governorate qurayat four of the infected flocks were located within the mainland with a single flock from the coastal town of qurayat fig 1a from the 243 flocks assayed using rt-pcr a total of 39 tested positive for ibv 1605 fig 1b of the 39 isolates sequenced it was possible to determine the genotypes of 32 8205 using blast table 2
 a total of five genotypes were represented within the sample size the majority of samples showed greatest homology to genotype 793b n  2639 6667 with the remaining isolates relating closely to m41 n  239 512 d274 n  239 512 is149406 n  139 256 and is88500 n  139 256 all 32 sequenced samples were submitted to genbank and assigned accession numbers fig 2
 the al wusta region demonstrated the highest flock prevalence rate 375 followed by the dhofar governorate 285 the 793b-like genotype was identified from all regions and governorates except the muscat governorate which remained the only region to have no ibv positive flocks dhofar governorate was the only infected region to demonstrate a single genotype 793b while the other infected regions had a presence of 2 genotypes all ibv infected flocks consisted of solely chickens with the exception of one duck and one turkey flock genotype 793b was detected in the duck and turkey flocks from ad dakhliyah and al batinah regions respectively the 793b genotype was also detected within chicken flocks from these regions results from the maximum likelihood analysis demonstrate that the isolates formed five distinct clusters fig 2 relating to genotypes of strains previously reported representative isolates from each of the five clusters were chosen for comparison of nucleotide and amino acid similarities table 3
 the majority of the 26 isolates clustering with uk491 had between 96 and 100 nucleotide homology resulting in 92100 amino acid similarity the is88500-like strain had a higher variation from the reference isolate with 90 nucleotide homology the three other genotypes demonstrated minimal nucleotide variation from the reference strains is149406like had 99 homology m41-like had 99 homology and d274-like had 98 homology we present the first study to identify the circulating ibv genotypes and ampv subtypes in backyard flocks in oman for this study an epidemiologically representative number of samples were collected from different regions of oman and transferred to the university of liverpool on fta cards the cards inactivate genomic material and allow for rna extraction once back in the laboratory proving useful for analysing field isolates away from the point of sampling the successful use of the cards for both ibv and ampv has been previously described awad et al 2014 moscoso et al 2005 using rt-pcr and direct amplicon sequencing we identified the prevalence of both viruses within backyard flocks in relation to location and poultry species thirty-nine flocks were identified as ibv positive with an overall prevalence of 1604 this finding is lower than previously reported in production farms within neighbouring countries for example 588 and 428 in jordan and iran respectively roussan et al 2009 seyfi abad shapouri et al 2004 however both studies sampled chickens within a higher density environment which may have contributed to the higher prevalence rate compared with the backyard flocks in this study 793b was the dominant ibv genotype infecting backyard flocks with an overall prevalence of 6667 in ibv-positive flocks the presence of 793b in commercial flocks has previously been reported in other middle east countries such as iran jordan and israel meir et al 2004b roussan et al 2008 seyfi abad shapouri et al 2004 in the last few years 793b vaccines and strains closely-related to 793b have been detected in the omani commercial chicken k ganapathy unpublished data 2010 the 793b isolates detected within the backyard flocks formed a close phylogenetic cluster indicating that potentially the same 793b strain may be circulating between different omani backyard flocks and regions oman-lewa-412 was distinct from other 793b-type isolates with only 92 identity with the vaccine strain which shows that it could be a virulent 793b virus circulating in this flock the mass serotype was the first to be isolated in the 1930s jackwood 2012 and adopted for use in early ibv vaccines jackwood 2012 sjaak de wit et al 2011 strains belonging to the d274 serotype were first isolated in the netherlands davelaar et al 1984 and later developed as a vaccine in the current study we detected m41-like and d274-like infections within four chicken flocks at a low prevalence of 082 each both genotypes have been previously reported in commercial flocks in the middle east roussan et al 2008 seyfi abad shapouri et al 2004 sjaak de wit et al 2011 albeit at a much higher prevalence than witnessed during this study despite no clinical disease being identified in the m41 or d274 positive birds both viruses are known for their ability to cause disease in chickens bourogaa et al 2009 feng et al 2012 ibv genotypes is149406 and is88500 were originally isolated in israel and are currently circulating in a number of middle east countries kahya et al 2013 meir et al 2004a here for the first time we report the detection of these important middle east variant ibv in backyard flocks even though a low prevalence was witnessed in this study their importance cannot be ignored due to their ability to cause severe respiratory reproductive and renal diseases kahya et al 2013 these viruses pose a threat not only to backyard flocks but also to the commercial poultry industry in oman and possibly further afield in the region it is of interest to note that ibv genotype 793b was detected in a flock of muscovy ducks from the ad dakhliyah region and in a turkey flock in the al batinah region this presence suggests that common circulating ibv genotypes such as 793b could potentially establish an infection in both ducks and turkeys using rt-pcr ibv has previously been detected in apparently healthy ducks in china and nigeria feng et al 2012 semeka et al 2013 despite previous reports having identified a turkey coronavirus closely related to ibv breslin et al 1999 cavanagh et al 2001 to date there has been only one report of ibv infecting turkeys semeka et al 2013 to our knowledge this appears to be the first report of an ibv-like detection in both duck and turkey flocks in the middle east all five ampv positive samples from this study were of subtype b and were isolated from five different states within four northern regions highlighting the sporadic distribution pattern of ampv in the backyard flocks although subtype a was not identified in this study co-circulation of both subtypes a and b within commercial flocks in the middle east has been previously reported banet-noach et al 2005 this appears to be the first detection of ampv within backyard flocks in oman with its involvement in respiratory and reproductive disorders georgiades et al 2001 jones 2010 the circulation of this pathogen is likely to pose a threat to backyard and commercial poultry in oman as subtype c has only previously been reported in france korea and the us and subtype d is only present in france neither subtypes were investigated during this study our study demonstrates the complex epidemiology of both ibv and ampv in backyard flocks in oman the reasons for the predominant detection of 793b-like over other ibv genotypes and the presence of a single ampv subtype subtype b are unknown further to this the potential sources of these viruses in the sampled flocks are not known the detection of 793b in duck and turkey flocks highlights the possible role of these birds as potential mechanical or biological carriers with the expanding commercial poultry industry and the increasing role of backyard poultry in oman it is essential to improve our understanding on the epidemiology of ibv and ampv strains for better control of these pathogens  comparative analysis of immune responses following experimental infection of pigs with european porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus strains of differing virulence eefke weesendorp sophie morgan norbert stockhofe-zurwieden ditta graaf j simon graham p johanna rebel mj   porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is a single stranded rna virus of the arteriviridae family meulenberg et al 1994 this virus is widespread and causes disease characterized by abortions and stillbirth increased pre-weaning mortality and respiratory disorders in growing pigs although prrsv alone is considered a primary pathogen co-infections with bacterial and viral pathogens like porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 swine influenza porcine respiratory coronavirus mycoplasma hyopneumoniae or streptococcus suis commonly occur and exacerbate clinical symptoms in growing pigs dorr et al 2007 as a consequence prrsv is one of the most significant causes of economic losses in the swine industry worldwide neumann et al 2005 prrsv shows a high degree of genetic variation two genotypes are recognized represented by two prototypes lelystad virus european type or genotype i prrsv and vr-2332 american type or genotype ii prrsv wensvoort et al 1991 collins et al 1992 the european type strains can be further divided into at least three subtypes pan-european subtype 1 and eastern european subtypes 2 and 3 stadejek et al 2008 between the european subtypes differences have been described in virulence of strains one eastern european subtype 3 strain lena was described to be more virulent than a subtype 1 strain as determined by clinical manifestations in infected pigs under experimental conditions karniychuk et al 2010 the mechanisms by which a prrsv strain exerts its virulence are unknown but it has been suggested to be related to in vivo replication capacity tissue distribution or immunomodulatory properties haynes et al 1997 johnson et al 2004 loving et al 2008 prrsv infects in vivo specific subsets of differentiated macrophages in lungs lymphoid tissues and placenta van breedam et al 2010 through interactions with these cells the virus may influence the host immune response in comparison to other viral infections such as porcine influenza virus or porcine coronavirus an altered innate immune response was observed with lower levels of ifn type i after infection with some prrsv strains van reeth et al 1999 the adaptive immune response is usually weak and delayed although an abundant virus-specific antibody response is induced this exhibits minimal virus neutralization activity kimman et al 2009 the cell-mediated immune response as measured by prrsv-specific ifn- secreting cells is late compared to other pathogens meier et al 2003 as a consequence a previous infection with prrsv may not protect against a homologous re-infection the induction of an insufficient adaptive immune response is also a feature of current modified live prrsv vaccines none of the european genotype vaccines on the market containing subtype 1 strains can claim to provide full protection murtaugh and genzow 2011 furthermore the genetic diversity of prrsv is thought to influence the efficacy of vaccines labarque et al 2004 in experimental studies prrsv vaccines were often not efficacious against infection with heterologous strains diaz et al 2006 zuckermann et al 2007 darwich et al 2010 to aid the development of more efficacious vaccines an improved knowledge of the immune response against prrsv is necessary until now most studies investigating the immune response of pigs after infection with field strains of prrsv used american genotype strains meier et al 2003 johnson et al 2004 klinge et al 2009 wang et al 2011 only a limited number of studies have used european type strains for infection diaz et al 2005 gmez-laguna et al 2009 and no information is available about immunological responses to the more virulent european subtype 3 strains the aim of the present study was to characterize the immune response after infection with two european subtype 1 strains belgium a and the prototype lelystad-ter huurne lv virus and a virulent subtype 3 strain lena this subtype 3 strain had caused severe clinical signs and 40 mortality in a previous study karniychuk et al 2010 we demonstrated between the strains significant differences in fever induction viral load ifn- secreting cells cytokine levels blood cell populations and the humoral response to an unrelated secondary antigen prrsv strain lena is a recent eastern european subtype 3 prrsv isolate and was used at the third passage on porcine alveolar macrophages pam lena was isolated from a belarusian farm with reproductive and respiratory failure karniychuk et al 2010 strains belgium a and lv are european subtype 1 prrsv isolates prrsv strain belgium a has also been described as strain 07v063 vanhee et al 2010 this strain was isolated from a stillborn piglet derived from a belgian farm during an outbreak of prrsv associated reproductive disorders karniychuk et al 2010 this strain was used at the third passage on pam prrsv strain lv-ter huurne was isolated during the 1991 epizootic from a clinical case of prrs in the netherlands wensvoort et al 1991 this strain was used at the seventh passage on pam sixty-four 5 week old male pigs cross-breeds between the great yorkshire large white type and dutch landrace were obtained from a prrsv-free farm in the netherlands with a high health status all pigs were confirmed negative for pcv2 by pcr one week prior to transport since prrsv and pcv2 co-infection can increase the severity of disease and cause post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome grau-roma et al 2011 to harmonize the genetic background of pigs across experimental groups four male pigs of each sixteen sows were selected and evenly distributed between four groups the four groups were housed in different rooms of an isolation unit between rooms clothing footwear and gloves were changed and materials needed for sampling and rectal temperature monitoring were provided separately for each room standard feed for finishing pigs was provided once a day and the pigs had unlimited access to water after one week of acclimatization the pigs were inoculated intranasally with 15 ml containing 105 50 tissue culture infectious dose tcid50 of either prrsv european subtype 3 strain lena group lena prrsv european subtype 1 strain belgium a group belgium a prrsv european subtype 1 strain lv-ter huurne group lv or an equal volume of pbs group control to study the humoral immune competence of pigs after prrsv infection four pigs per group were immunized intramuscularly in the neck behind the ear with 2 ml of adv-vaccine on days 7 and 21 post inoculation pi the inactivated adv vaccine suvaxyn i-aujeszky was kindly supplied by pfizer animal health this vaccine contained an oil-in-water adjuvant at days 3 and 7 pi four pigs per group were euthanized all remaining pigs were euthanized at the termination of the experiment on day 35 pi the experiment was approved by the ethics committee for animal experiments of the central veterinary institute of wageningen ur rectal temperature and clinical signs were recorded daily fever was defined as body temperature higher than 405 c for one day or 40 c for two consecutive days for quantitative assessment of the severity of disease a list of eleven prrsv-relevant criteria was used table 1
 for each criterion a score was recorded as either normal score 0 slightly altered score 1 distinct clinical sign score 2 or severe prrsv sign score 3 these scores were added up to obtain a total score per pig per day serum samples were collected at days 0 3 5 7 10 14 21 26 and 33 pi to determine virus titers and antibody levels these samples were stored directly at 70 c until testing whole blood samples of the non-adv immunized pigs that remained in the experiment until day 35 pi were collected in paxgene-rna tubes becton dickinson and company at days 0 3 7 14 and 33 pi in paxgene rna tubes preanalytix cells are lysed and the rna is stabilized samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and then stored at  70 c until rna isolation heparin stabilized blood samples were collected at days 0 3 7 10 14 21 26 and 33 pi peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc were isolated from these blood samples and used for ifn- elispot assay and flow cytometry isolation of pbmc was performed by density gradient centrifugation using 50 ml leucosep tubes greiner bio-one in brief the heparinized whole-blood samples were diluted with equal volumes of pbs and 30 ml of the diluted blood was added to a leucosep tube the cell separation tubes were centrifuged at room temperature for 20 min at 1380

  005 differences were observed in clinical signs and body temperature between the pigs infected with the lena strain and pigs infected with the belgium a or lv strain fig 1
a and b all lena-infected pigs showed fever between days 2 and 15 pi one belgium a-infected pig 401404 c between days 0 and 3 pi and none of the lv-infected pigs fig 1a clinical signs were observed in lena-infected pigs between days 3 and 17 pi fig 1b with animals displaying reduced liveliness and appetite an increased breathing frequency and coughing between days 3 and 17 pi in the belgium a-infected group one pig developed a red coloration of the skin of the ears between days 14 and 16 pi but did not show fever or other clinical signs related to the prrsv infection in the group of lv-infected pigs one pig showed a clinical score of 6 at day 8 pi and was found dead the next day post-mortem examination showed that the cause of death was an intra-abdominal testicular torsion with infarction thus the mortality was not prrsv related and the clinical sign score of this pig on day 8 pi was removed from the analysis virus isolation on pam cells was performed on serum from all inoculated pigs and showed that infectious virus was detected in the serum of almost all prrsv inoculated pigs at day 3 pi table 2
 from day 21 pi 50 or less of the pigs infected with the belgium a and lv strain were still viraemic this is in contrast to the lena-infected pigs with 78 animals viraemic at day 26 pi at day 33 pi most pigs had cleared the infection from blood and only one lena-infected and one belgium a infected pig remained viraemic from the four non-adv immunized pigs that remained in the experiment until day 33 pi the serum samples were also titrated the virus titration assay showed that peak virus titers of the lena-infected pigs 1054 tcid50ml were higher than pigs infected with the belgium a or lv strain 1038 tcid50ml and 1040 tcid50ml respectively fig 2
a the qrt-pcr performed on serum from all inoculated animals revealed data comparable to the virus titrations although the level of viral rna in serum of lv-infected pigs 1024 tcid50ml was higher than in serum from belgium a-infected pigs 1015 tcid50ml fig 2b antibodies against prrsv were detected in all infected groups from day 10 pi fig 3
a no antibodies were detected in the control group there were no significant differences in antibody levels between the strains at day 33 pi no neutralizing antibodies were detected in any of the three infected groups data not shown the highest numbers of ifn- secreting cells after homologous prrsv stimulation were observed in pigs infected with the belgium a strain peaking at a mean of 162 ifn- sc25  105

 pbmc at day 26 pi for the control pigs the effect of infection on the number of immune cells in blood was most pronounced in lena-infected pigs fig 4
 the number of t helper cells and cd8 t cells were significantly lower in the lena-infected pigs than in the control pigs this was also observed for the belgium a-infected pigs although the level was not decreased to the same extent as in the lena-infected pigs the memory t helper cell level was also lower in the lena-infected pigs compared to the control pigs but was followed by an increase this was also observed for the belgium a strain but the effect was less pronounced the lv-infected pigs did not show a decrease but only an increase of memory t helper cell at the end of the experiment the number of nk cells of all infected groups increased after inoculation it was significantly higher than the control pigs for lv-infected pigs at days 10 and 33 pi and for belgium a-infected pigs at day 33 pi only the lv-infected pigs showed an increase in cytotoxic t cells at the end of the experiment compared to the control pigs initially a significant decrease was observed in the number of b cells of all infected groups compared to the control pigs then the number of b cells increased to a significantly higher level for the lv and belgium a-infected pigs at the end of the experiment all strains showed a significant increase in monocytes at day 21 pi compared to the control pigs in general significant inductions of cytokine mrna in blood cells were detected in the lena and belgium a-infected pigs within the first week after inoculation fig 5
 no significant induction in cytokine mrna levels was observed for the lv-infected pigs compared to the control pigs a significant up regulation of il-12 mrna has been observed for the lena 76 fold and belgium a strain 4 fold at day 3 pi compared to the control for ifn- mrna lena 42 fold belgium a 40 fold ifn- lena 89 fold belgium a 92 fold il-1 lena 67 fold belgium a 54 fold and il-10 lena 130 fold belgium a 183 fold an upregulation was observed at day 7 pi at day 7 pi there was also a significant increase of tnf- mrna in blood of the lena-infected pigs 37 fold compared to the control interestingly at the end of the trial at day 33 pi there was an increase in ifn- mrna in the blood of belgium a 52 fold and lv-infected pigs 47 fold and not in blood of the lena-infected pigs following adv immunization antibodies were detected in serum from pigs infected with the belgium a or lv strain and control pigs from day 21 pi fig 6
 in serum from pigs infected with the lena strain antibodies were detected one sampling point later at day 26 pi at this time antibody titers from pigs infected with the lena strain were significantly lower 03 log10 than the other groups control pigs 24 log10 pigs infected with lv 21 log10 belgium a 18 log10 in this study the pathogenicity of and immune response to three european type prrsv strains were compared infection with the subtype 3 strain lena resulted in clinical signs in contrast to infection with the subtype 1 strains which did not induce fever or clinical signs in a previous study with this strain in 6-week-old conventional pigs clinical signs were more severe than in the present study and 40 of the pigs died within 3 weeks post-inoculation karniychuk et al 2010 the severity of clinical signs and death of the pigs in that study might have been due to secondary infections since arcanobacterium pyogenes and s suis were isolated from the lungs of two pigs we used pigs from a farm with a specific-pathogen-free status and pigs were kept under animal biosafety level 3 conditions which would prevent introductions of infectious agents this could explain the different clinical outcome between the studies although it cannot be excluded that differences in severity of clinical signs were caused by other factors such as differences in pig breed lewis et al 2007 fever was only observed in pigs infected with the lena strain these pigs had around 100 times higher virus loads during the peak of infection and higher cytokine levels in blood mainly tnf- compared to the other strains a relationship between tnf- productionresponse in blood and the pathogenicity of prrsv strains has been demonstrated before liu et al 2010 it was described that the highly pathogenic american genotype prrsv strain hun4 which induces fever and clinical signs induced higher levels of tnf- in blood early in infection than its derivative strain hun4-f112 of lower virulence liu et al 2010 the hun4 also replicated faster and to higher titers than the hun4-f112 strain the higher virus replication most likely means more trigger of innate immune defences more cytokine production and more inflammation resulting in fever the level of ifn- secreting cells was used to measure the efficiency of the adaptive cellular immune response the level of ifn- secreting cells remained low for pigs infected with the lena strain but for pigs infected with the belgium a from day 14 pi or lv strain from day 21 pi an increase in ifn- secreting cells was observed compared to the control pigs this would indicate that the subtype 1 strains belgium a and lv induce a cell-mediated immune response in contrast to pigs infected with the lena strain interestingly the level of ifn- secreting cells of the belgium a-infected pigs was high maximum average of 647 ifn- secreting cells106 pbmc compared to the lv strain maximum average of 132 ifn- secreting cells106 pbmc most studies with both european and american genotype strains showed levels lower than 100 ifn- secreting cells106 pbmc before day 33 pi diaz et al 2005 batista et al 2004 it is not clear why the level of ifn- secreting cells of the belgium a-infected pigs was that high besides a stronger induction of the ifn- response in vivo it is also possible that the belgium a strain has a stronger ability to stimulate cells in vitro in the elispot assay this has been observed for other strains previously by daz et al 2012 for all strains virus could be isolated from day 3 pi and peaked between days 7 and 14 pi then decreased strongly after day 14 pi during the decrease of viremia an increase of nk cells was observed mainly for the belgium a and lv strain which could be related to viral clearance beside the role of nk cells in virus clearing cytotoxic t cells might have been involved in the clearing at the end of the experiment cytotoxic t cells were higher than in the control pigs for all infected groups at day 26 pi although only significantly higher for lv-infected pigs this higher level of cytotoxic t cells coincided with a peak in ifn- secreting cells the increase observed in the cytotoxic t cell level could partly be related to clonal expansion of prrsv-specific t cells although this increase could also be due to a homeostatic regulation of the infection and inflammation a relationship between viral clearance and cytotoxic t cells has been previously observed in pigs infected with european and american genotype strains lamontagne et al 2003 gmez-laguna et al 2009 however others failed to show that cd3cd8high cells exert ctl activity toward lv-infected alveolar macrophages costers et al 2009 further studies should determine whether the prrsv-specific cytotoxic t cell activity in vivo is involved in viral clearance it has been described for prrsv that the polyclonal activation of b cells occurs mainly in lymphoid organs lamontagne et al 2001 diaz et al 2005 the mobilization of these cells to tissue may explain the decrease in frequency of b cells in blood of the infected pigs the activation of b cells in the lymph nodes could have resulted in the production of prrsv-specific antibodies that were detected in blood from day 10 pi during the last week of the experiment at day 26 pi the level of b cells of the infected pigs was higher than the control pigs at which point the level of prrsv-specific antibodies was also at a peak a similar course of cd21 b cell levels in blood has been observed previously shi et al 2008 others however observed either an increase or a decrease in cd21 cells for at least 4 weeks after infection with a european genotype strain diaz et al 2005 gmez-laguna et al 2009 although in our study higher levels of b cells were observed in infected pigs than in the control pigs at the end of the experiment this did not contribute to viral clearance by the production of neutralizing antibodies the absence of neutralizing antibodies has been observed for infections with european genotype strains before diaz et al 2005 however others found neutralizing antibodies with the lelystad strain around week 34 pi vanhee et al 2010 the difference in results can be attributed to differences in the virus neutralization test method therefore it cannot be ruled out that there were small amounts of neutralizing antibodies at day 33 pi but the level remained below the detection limit of the virus neutralization test used after many viral infections such as swine influenza or porcine coronavirus van reeth et al 1999 a rapid production of type i ifn ifn- by the innate immune response supresses initial viral replication and promotes the adaptive immune response kimman et al 2009 for prrsv it has been shown in vitro that the type i ifn response is suppressed ait-ali et al 2011 there are however conflicting reports of prrsv inhibiting or inducing a type i ifn response in vivo van reeth et al 1999 gmez-laguna et al 2009 in the present study an increase in ifn- mrna in blood was observed at day 7 pi for the lena and belgium a-infected pigs in parallel with the viral load no increased level of ifn- mrna production was observed in the group of lv-infected pigs this can be the result of differences between strains in ifn- induction as has been described to occur in in vitro studies with infection of porcine alveolar macrophages with different prrsv strains lee et al 2004 or different infectionreplication kinetics of this strain in combination with the short-lived nature of mrna in blood pigs have large numbers of  t cells circulating in blood these cells have been described to play a role in both innate and adaptive immune responses to viral or bacterial infections gerner et al 2009 gamma delta t cells can act as antigen presenting cells or induce cytotoxic responses regulatory functions have been demonstrated in mice and humans gerner et al 2009 after infection with prrsv they can respond by proliferation and production of ifn- olin et al 2005 in the present study the level of cd8 t cells decreased to a significantly lower level than the control pigs for the lena and belgium a-infected pigs at the peak of viremia this level returned to normal for the belgium a-infected pigs at day 21 pi a similar course as for the belgium a-infected pigs in the level of  t cells has been observed after infection with an american genotype strain shi et al 2008 however for the lena-infected pigs the level of cd8 t cells remained low until the end of the experiment at day 33 pi because of the role of these cells in innate and adaptive responses this could result in increased susceptibility or a decreased response to secondary infections such as those observed for the lower response of lena-infected pigs to immunization with adv there is a general concept that prrsv is an immunosuppressive agent there are however contradicting results about the immunomodulating effect of prrsv de bruin et al 2000 murtaugh et al 2002 suradhat et al 2006 jung et al 2009 these contradicting results could amongst other things be caused by the differences in virus strains used in the current study adv immunization was used to study the effect of the prrsv strains on the humoral immune response to another antigen it was shown that infection with lena influenced the development of an antibody response against adv this was in contrast to infection with the lv or belgium a strains the results with the lv strain were in agreement with the results of de bruin et al 2000 who also showed that there was no effect of the lv strain infection on the antibody development against adv for more virulent strains like lena it has been shown before that infection can suppress the immune system infection with american genotype isolates that caused clinical signs resulted in classical swine fever virus vaccine failure or increased disease after a secondary infection with porcine respiratory coronavirus suradhat et al 2006 jung et al 2009 in the present study the mechanisms behind the delayed adv antibody response of pigs infected with the lena strain might be the lower level of t helper cells cd8 t cells and b cells in blood of these lena infected pigs before the first immunization at day 7 pi possibly resulting in a lower level of effector cells the present study showed differences in the immune responses to three different european genotype prrsv strains however the general picture was similar to other european genotype strains a late adaptive immune response with no detectable neutralizing antibodies and especially for the lena strain low levels of ifn- secreting cells diaz et al 2005 gmez-laguna et al 2009 the virulence of the strain seemed to be mostly affecting the cell populations and cytokine levels in blood although several mechanisms behind the difference in virulence have been discussed further studies on cell populations and cytokine production in tissues should provide more insight in the mechanisms behind immune modulation by different virus strains this knowledge on immune modulation by prrsv should aid the development of intervention strategies such as improved vaccines or other therapeutic agents  clinical features of children hospitalized with influenza a and b infections during the 20122013 influenza season in italy livia mancinelli manuela onori carlo concato roberto sorge stefano chiavelli luana coltella umberto raucci antonio reale donato menichella cristina russo   influenza is one of the most common respiratory infectious diseases and is responsible for between 3 and 5 million cases of severe influenza illness each year 1 the influenza viruses are members of the orthomyxoviridae family and contain a single-stranded rna genome that is distributed in eight separate segments there are three types of influenza viruses a b and c 2 that have different structural arrangements of internal nucleoprotein and matrix protein antigens the segmented genome may be responsible for the development of pandemic strains whereas mutations aminoacid substitutions may be responsible for the development of influenza epidemics 3 influenza typically results in mild-to-moderate illness in healthy individuals however disease severity tends to increase in children the elderly and individuals with chronic medical conditions pulmonary cardiovascular liver renal and neurological diseases or immunosuppression children are more susceptible to infection 4 with annual incidence rates up to 30  5 in particular children under 5 years of age are more susceptible to contracting influenza since they are an immunologically nave population 6 moreover they can also be considered the primary transmitters of influenza in the community 7 8 and shed virus at higher viral titers and for a longer period than adults 9 community based surveillance programs have found that the h3n2 subtype is detected more frequently in adults while h1n1 and influenza b viruses are detected more often in children 10 after the beginning of the 2009 h1n1 pandemic the center for disease control cdc seasonal surveillance reports documented an increased prevalence of influenza a virus flua compared to influenza b virus flub during the 20102011 and 20112012 influenza seasons in the 20122013 season flua and flub were detected in similar proportions in europe the flua epidemic was primarily caused by the h1n1 subtype which outnumbered the h3n2 subtype by in ratio 21 the flub epidemic was driven by the byamagata lineage which was more prevalent than the bvictoria lineage by a ratio of 51 11 although a large amount of data related to influenza surveillance activity is available 1214 there are few studies that compare differences in the clinical presentations of flua and b subtypes isolated in children from italy since that in the seasons 20102011 and 20112012 the circulation of flub was decreasing the objective of this study was to characterize the clinical features

 fever was the most common symptom in flu positive patients in patients with flub a fever 38 c range 37379 c was significantly more frequent than flua p  0019 and patients affected by flua had a significantly higher frequency of respiratory simptoms p  0034 than patients with flub apnea was equally distributed in flua and flub patients no significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of laryngitis pharyngitis bronchitis bronchiolitis bronchopneumonia pneumonia or pertussis twenty five patients presented with neoplasiahematological malignancies or a severe underlying disease such as chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems metabolic diseases and neurological disorders that were clustered in congenital and genetic disorders table 1 in patients suffering from underlying diseases flua infection was more prevalent than flub p  0044 the normal concentration of crp in healthy human serum ranges from 0 to 050 mgdl in the flu patients the mean crp value was 171  254 for flua patients and 114  172 for flub patients a value  050 was obtained in 45  of flua cases and in 46  of flub information related to the department where patients were admitted is shown in table 1 patients accessed the hospital through the emergency unit in 337  of flua and 663  of flub cases p  0017 the median of length of stay was 5 days range 059 for flua and 3 days range 0116 for flub community acquired influenza infections were equally distributed between the flua and flub patients while among nosocomial infections flub was responsible for 909  versus 91  of flua p  0039 there were no significant differences observed in the frequency of co-infections between the different types of flu among the 62 patients infected with flua 18 2903  co-infections with other respiratory pathogens were detected 13 of which were co-infections with respiratory viruses and 5 were with bacteria in 71 patients infected with influenza b 11 155  co-infections were detected 7 of which were co-infections with viruses and 4 were with bacteria there were no co-infections detected in patients with the bvictoria0287 lineage the respiratory pathogens responsible for the co-infections are listed in table 2
 the distribution of influenza cases during the 20122013 season is shown in fig 2 the peak incidence of positive cases was between the 5th and 11th week of 2013 the highest incidence occurred for flua and b in the 7th and 8th week respectively corresponding to the middle of february fig 3 the first flua case was detected at the end of november 2012 and started circulating earlier than flub which was first detected at the end of december 2012

 in this study a comparison of the clinical features presented in children admitted to our hospital resulted positive for flua and b infections was analyzed bambino ges childrens hospital is a reference pediatric centre for the care and treatment of children coming from central and southern italy flub was slightly more prevalent 5338  than flua 4662  in the study population this is consistent with the 20122013 ecdc surveillance report that reported a similar proportion of seasonal flua and b in europe however flua peaked and declined slightly before flub and the highest infection frequency was evident during the winter season our data show a similar seasonal trend for flua and b however in contrast to the data reported by the ecdc the circulation of flua ended later than flub our results were consistent too with the prevalence of fluah1n1 34  fluah3n2 5  and flub 58  in italy during the 20122013 flu season reported to influnet a sentinel surveillance system for influenza 17 influnet also reported 3  of flua cases that were not subtyped however these data reflect the whole population and our data are concerned with only pediatric patients the results of laboratory testing and clinical findings were compared for flua and flub patients to investigate clinical differences between the groups no consistent differences were observed in the clinical presentation of patients by subtype viral according to results of studies about the clinical characteristics of patients positive for influenza a and b 18 males seemed to be more susceptible to contracting flu compared to females and specifically flub this is concordant with previous studies in which the greater humoral and cell-mediated immune responses of females to viral antigens was demonstrated to play an important role in determining the gender variability in viral infections and in females being beneficial against infectious diseases 19 with regard to the age distribution flua was more common in children less than 1 year old where they can cause more severe infections confirming previous studies 20 21 and flub was more common in school age children moreover length of stay in children with flua was significantly higher than those infected with flub being the median 5 days range 059 for flua and 3 days range 0116 for flub specifically this long hospital stay 59 and 116 days was for flua in a patient with complications due to tracheostomy procedure while for flub a nosocomial infection occurred in a oncoematological patient this finding is unsual since that in a previuos study children with influenza b in comparison with those infected by ah1n1 influenza virus had significantly higher hospitalization rates p  005 20 is possible to speculate that the longer hospitalization for flua patients be correlated to the major cases with fever 38 c and respiratory simptoms no significant differences were observed in crp levels between flua and b patients and a similar frequency of patients with elevated crp was detected in both flua and b fever was confirmed as a major influenza symptom 21 22 a similar number of flua and flub patients presented with a temperature 38 however flub patients were significantly more likely to have a fever 38 c than flua patients in contrast respiratory symptoms were mainly detected in flua patients table 1 pre-existing diseases condition the clinical expression of influenza resulting in a greater number of these children developing lower respiratory tract infection 23 we found that flu patients with underlying malignancies such as lymphoma leukemia solid tumor or tubulopathy were more susceptible to flub infection in agreement with data previously reported 24 in contrast patients with congenital diseases hypoplastic left heart syndrome neuromotor disorder swyer james syndrome epilepsy cerebral palsy laryngotracheal cleft or immune deficiency and genetic preexisting conditions cystic fibrosis sickle-cell anemia trisomy of chromosome 10 or niemann pick disease were more susceptible to flua infection this is probably related to flua patients younger than those with flub in our study 12133 902  of flu infections were hospital acquired with flub being the principal etiological agent responsible patients that contracted nosocomial infections were mainly immunosuppressed and admitted through the iifu 8 cases flub followed by the pediatrics 2 cases flub and 1 flua and surgery 1 case flua units numerous examples of nosocomial flu outbreaks have been reported in long-term care facilities for the elderly experimental evidences supports the fact that humans generate infectious particles in both respiratory droplets and aerosols and that their generation is enhanced during influenza illness 25 moreover children who do not have or minimal immunity against influenza viruses and immunocompromised individuals who can shed virus for long periods of time at high titers have already been pinpointed as good transmitters in comparison to healthy adults however it is unclear why flub in comparison to flua should cause a more severe infection in the group of immunosuppressed and moreover in the population object of the study the number of patients with malignancies is low and it is difficult to establish if the difference is really significant in our study there were no significant differences between co-infections with viral or bacterial pathogens in flua and b patients all of the co-infections investigated were in children with a mean age less than 5 years one death was reported in a flua patient affected by quadriplegia and chronic respiratory failure it is possible that flua could have been responsible for further impeding the patients ability to breathe there were some limitations in this study being a retrospective study it was not possible to collect more clinical data as well as the information about the vaccination history of patients that tested positive for flua and b in addition this was a single-center study and only one year was analysed our study was primarily focused on the clinical presentation of flua and flub infections to provide additional information concerning the clinical presentation of pediatric influenza no outcomes due to other respiratory viruses were evaluated further studies that describe how co infections with other viruses impact flu infections could be useful to our knowledge there is limited published data regarding the clinical differences between seasonal flua and b in pediatrics after the 2009 pandemics the main findings from our study confirm that although fever is a major component of influenza a and b presentation respiratory symptoms were more severe and the length of the hospital stay was longer for flua patients than flub patients concluding that the increasing of flub in the season 20122013 was without any dramatic change in clinical manifestation although some studies have reported gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain diarrhea and vomiting to be more common with flub infection 26 this was not the case in this study the different viral types and subtypes should be routinely identifed by diagnostic laboratory to best address clinicians to appropiate therapeutic measures in summary our results suggest that the clinical features correlated to different flu viruses and to the relevant subtypes should be taken into consideration by health authorities to implement prevention strategies with the aim to reduce the number of sick subjects the prevalence of hospitalization and the circulation of flu  molecular epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus transmission in childcare helen chu y jane kuypers christian renaud anna wald emily martin mary fairchok amalia magaret misty sarancino janet englund a   respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection is the most important viral cause of severe respiratory tract infection in young children1 in the first year of life 98 of children become infected with rsv with frequent reinfections in their second and third years2 3 the vast proportion of children with rsv are not hospitalized the burden of rsv disease in the community is substantial though molecular epidemiology of transmission is not well-characterized4 5 6 7 in the united states 41 of children attend childcare8 which is a known risk factor for severe rsv disease and likely serves as an important route of transmission to other attendees and family members9 10 the socioeconomic impact of illness associated with childcare attendance includes work days missed and parental stress11 a 16-year longitudinal study of childcare attendees in the 1980s using culture techniques showed that rsv was the most frequent viral etiology of respiratory illness2 12
 the molecular epidemiology of rsv transmission is characterized by sequencing the hypervariable region of the glycoprotein g coding region13 transmission of genetically identical virus as well as the presence of multiple distinct co-circulating strains have been described in nosocomial settings14 15 no studies have been performed to characterize rsv disease burden in a community childcare setting using current molecular diagnostics despite its importance as a potential setting for public health interventions such as vaccines and infection control measures the goal of our study was to characterize the transmission and clinical impact of rsv in childcare we hypothesized that the spread of unique viral strains within a childcare setting would be rapid rapid transmission was defined as detection of an identical viral strain within a one-week period within the childcare facilities we further hypothesized that rsv infections in childcare attendees would be associated with increased symptom duration as compared to infections with other respiratory viruses children age 4 weeks30 months attending full-time childcare on fort lewis army base fort lewis washington usa were enrolled in a prospective cohort study from february 1 2006 to april 30 2008 and from october 28 2008 to june 30 200916 17 informed consent was obtained from caregivers children were followed for the presence of respiratory symptoms and the study nurse was alerted at symptom onset by childcare staff or caregivers an illness episode was defined as at least 2 of 5 symptoms including cough rhinorrhea fever wheezing and nasal congestion each child had a nasopharyngeal swab collected at symptom onset and weekly thereafter until symptom resolution a daily symptom diary was completed by the caregiver for 10 days following symptom onset from february 1 2006 to may 1 2006 nasopharyngeal samples were collected only with illness episodes in children enrolled after may 1 2006 a sample was also collected at time of enrollment regardless of symptom status childcare centers designated as facilities x y and z were located several kilometers apart children were enrolled from rooms where full-time care was provided defined as 20 hweek these included 6 of 11 rooms in facility x 7 of 11 rooms in facility y and 2 of 11 rooms in facility z infection control procedures were performed and documented according to a standard operating procedure including daily bleach disinfection of all toys routine hand washing after toileting and diaper changes and before and after meals and surface decontamination with bleach18 irb approval was obtained from seattle childrens hospital and madigan army medical center nasopharyngeal samples were tested for 13 respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay including rsv human metapneumovirus influenza viruses a and b parainfluenza virus 14 adenovirus human coronavirus group 1 229e n6l 63 and group 2 oc43 and hku1 rhinovirus and human bocavirus subtyping was performed for rsv-positive samples according to previously published protocols19 20 rsv-positive samples were sequenced using a hemi-nested pcr protocol targeting the second hypervariable region of the glycoprotein coding region21 complementary dna m-mlv reverse transcriptase usb corp cleveland oh was amplified with forward primer gab 5-ycaytttgaagtgttcaactt-3 g gene 504524 nt and reverse primer fv 5-gttatgacactggtataccaacc-3 f gene 186163 nt the amplification procedure included 2 min at 98 c 35 cycles of 98 c for 30 s 55 c for 1 min and 72 c for 1 min followed by 72 c for 7 min a hemi-nested pcr was then performed using m13-tagged forward primer gab and reverse primer f1ab 5-caactccattgttatttgcc-3 f gene 322 nt and 25 l of pcr product with the same protocol as in step 1 five hundred base pair amplicons were gel-extracted qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen germany and sequenced applied biosystems 3730xl sequencer pcr products from some samples were cloned topo ta cloning kit invitrogen grand island ny prior to sequencing rsv-positive community samples during the same respiratory seasons were sequenced to serve as controls sociodemographic clinical and virologic data were analyzed using stata 101 stata corp college station tx generalized estimating equations gees to account for multiple illness episodes per child were used to compare symptom duration using identity link and health care visit frequency using poisson link in rsv-positive and rsv-negative illnesses and viral load symptom duration and positive sample duration in rsv illnesses with and without another respiratory virus detected univariable gee using linear link was used to estimate the influence of clinical characteristics on rsv viral load cumulative incidence curves were constructed to describe rsv spread within individual childcare rooms rapid transmission was defined as the presence of an identical viral strain within the childcare facility within one week16 22

  0001 but insufficient variation within subtype b strains to distinguish clades we identified clusters of rsv episodes in rooms y11 subtype b season 1 and x3 subtype a season 3 during both clusters 50 of enrolled children in each room were infected within six days of the first case fig 5
 in total 8 of 12 children in y11 and 8 of 13 children in x3 developed rsv over a 16-day period samples from two episodes 14 days apart in y11 contained the same rsv strain as did 5 episodes in x3 that spanned the entire 16-day period these results suggest that child-to-child transmission of one viral strain was likely responsible for these clusters of rsv illness a third cluster of seven rsv episodes was identified in room x3 during season 1 consisting of two subtype a and five subtype b viruses sequencing of the two subtype a episodes showed identical viral strains while sequencing of three subtype b episodes showed two different viral strains indicating that multiple viral strains co-circulated simultaneously in the childcare room fig 6
 in season 1 we identified four subtype b episodes with identical strains in rooms y11 and x3 from november 13 to december 8 at the same time three subtype a episodes with identical strains were identified in rooms x3 and y2 these two facilities were located several kilometers apart making it less likely that direct inoculation from child-to-child was the mode of transmission no rsv-positive sibling pairs enrolled in the study were located in different facilities however sibling pairs who were not enrolled in the study or parents many of whom worked on fort lewis may also have transmitted rsv in season 3 eight subtype a episodes with identical strains were detected in facility x in rooms x3 x5 and x6 from november 18 to december 5 suggesting transmission both within and between rooms within facility x during season 3 with temporal and geographic clustering of two additional clusters of identical strains in december and march fig 6 rsv was also detected in two sibling pairs both in the same childcare room in one sibling pair rsv was detected simultaneously in both children sequencing results from this pair showed identical viral strains in both children in the other sibling pair rsv was detected one week apart though these samples were not sequenced our study is the first to describe the molecular epidemiology of rsv transmission in childcare a potential target of infection control interventions in the community among childcare attendees in our study rsv-positive illness episodes were associated with greater symptom duration number of parental work and childcare days missed and visits to health care providers than illness episodes without rsv detected using molecular sequencing we documented high rates of infection and transmission of identical rsv strains in childcare within one week of the index case we detected an identical viral strain in another child in the same facility this same strain was detected in 7 additional children in the facility within a 16-day period rsv viral load in hospitalized infants may predict duration of hospitalization and studies of experimentally rsv-infected adults show that peak viral load correlates with symptom score28 29 we did not find a relationship between viral load and symptom duration the criteria used to characterize disease severity in the inpatient setting may not be applicable to our outpatient population or we may have captured both primary and secondary rsv cases potentially impacting viral load the significance of respiratory viral co-infection remains controversial we found no relationship between co-infection and rsv viral load or symptom duration four prior studies did not find increased rsv disease severity among hospitalized children when multiple viruses were detected30 31 32 33 this is in contrast to a study showing that co-infection with rsv and human metapneumovirus was associated with increased disease severity compared to rsv alone as measured by intensive care unit admission34 no children were co-infected with rsv and human metapneumovirus in our study we documented simultaneous circulation of multiple rsv strains in an outbreak setting with predominance of one viral strain within a 16-day period among 9 childcare attendees in the same facility we showed that within one week of the first case another child had an identical strain detected suggesting rapid child-to-child transmission within the facility further we demonstrated that once rsv was detected in a childcare room over 50 of children in the room became infected within a week while there was clustering of identical viral strains within rooms and facilities we also found that several unique viral strains circulated in a room simultaneously during an outbreak this is consistent with data from outbreaks in bone marrow transplant settings35 36 but has not been previously investigated in the childcare setting an important source of community-acquired respiratory viral infections viral transmission correlates directly with degree and intensity of hand or nasal inoculation with large droplets or fomites37 38 activities which are likely to be frequent within childcare although infection control measures including handwashing and sanitation of surfaces were utilized according to current guidelines in our facilities39 40 41 our results imply that rsv is readily transmitted in childcare facilities despite these routine measures this study has some limitations children may shed and transmit rsv after they become asymptomatic and we did not perform regular sampling in asymptomatic participants42 although we captured ten days of symptom data younger children may experience symptoms lasting longer further we were not able to use a preceding asymptomatic period as criteria for a new illness episode many children enrolled in our childcare facilities were never symptom-free particularly when considering cough and rhinorrhea each new illness episode that was close in timing to a prior illness episode was reviewed by the study staff and a consensus decision was made to decide whether this should be classified as a new episode versus a continuation of a prior illness in general children who developed new symptoms as opposed to worsening of previous symptoms were classified as having a new illness episode finally we sequenced rsv from only 42 of episodes though our ability to sequence viruses from clinical samples is consistent with other studies characterizing rsv transmission35
 our study shows that the childcare setting is a significant source of rapid child-to-child rsv transmission and that once acquired rsv leads to significantly greater symptom duration than other respiratory viruses these results highlight the significant clinical and socioeconomic impact of rsv in the community and emphasize that the childcare setting is an important potential site of interventions to reduce the burden of rsv disease interventions that reduce rsv transmission in childcare such as vaccines and enhanced infection control measures are likely to have a substantial

201718 influenza epidemic season in poland based on the sentinel surveillance system mieczyslaw pokorski k uniewska k szymaski e hallmann-szeliska d kowalczyk r saamatin a masny l brydak b   the sentinel influenza surveillance system allows monitoring of the course and dynamics of epidemic seasons in poland virological data tallied by 16 voivodship sanitary and epidemiological stations of the country allow to identify the dominant virus strain and to provide information on the age groups that are most vulnerable to the virus cielak et al 2017 monitoring of the influenza virus activity in the inter-pandemic period also is a part of the national surveillance plan in poland the information about the emergence of a new pandemic strain can be obtained immediately and thus the anti-influenza measures implemented at the national level bednarska et al 2016 in 2009 the eu commission has issued recommendations in which it is assumed that the influenza vaccination rate in high-risk groups should reach 75 in all european countries up to the 201415 epidemic season the risks groups included adults above 65 years of age and all persons over 6 months of age with chronic diseases ecdc 2017 however this goal has not been achieved in most of the countries weimbergen 2018 the vaccination rate in the 201718 epidemic season in the population of poland amounted to 34 such a dismal vaccination rate places the country in the last place in europe brydak 2019 further seasonal epidemics occur in poland every year causing a large number of deaths and post-influenza morbidity incurring huge socioeconomic costs brydak 2018 the epidemics cannot be properly countered without a proper population vaccination rate the main preventive measure against influenza this study seeks to define the dynamics of influenza infections and the prevalence of dominant viral types in poland during the 201718 epidemic season based on the data tallied by the sentinel influenza surveillance program the study material included nasal and pharyngeal swab samples analyzed in 16 voivodship sanitary and epidemiological stations and in the department of influenza research national influenza center in national institute of public health  national institute of hygiene data were analyzed and reported using the sentinel influenza surveillance system a total of 1585 patients participated in the study they were divided into 7 age groups 04 59 1014 1525 2644 4564 and 65 years specimens collected from patients were analyzed for the identification of influenza type a and b viruses by pcr techniques from a 200 l clinical sample suspended in physiological saline 50 l of viral rna resuspended in rnase-free water was obtained for the assay a maxwell 16 viral total nucleic acid purification kit was used promega corporation madison wi according to the manufacturers instructions the analytes were further analyzed to determine viral subtypes using a light thermocycler 20 system roche diagnostics rotkreuz switzerland the primers and probes were obtained from the international reagent resource run by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the reaction was carried out in accordance with the manufacturers instructions to obtain cdna rna was subjected to reverse transcription at 50 c for 30 min then cdna was subjected to the initiating process 1 cycle of 95 c for 2 min followed by 45 cycles of amplification denaturation at 95 c for 15 s annealing at 55 c for 10 s and elongation at 72 c for 20 s positive control constituted viral rna obtained from the vaccine

onestep ace detection kit seeplex seoul south korea was used according to the manufacturers instructions when the reaction was completed the product was separated on a 2 agarose gel by electrophoresis the probability of occurrence of influenza infection was estimated using a logistic regression model odds ratios were calculated for all age groups with reference to the 65 group the statistical analysis was performed using commercial ibm spss statistical software armonk ny in the 20172018 epidemic season a total of 1585 samples one from each individual were collected through the sentinel influenza surveillance system the overall number of analyzed samples remained at a low level until week 1 of 2018 not exceeding 24 per week later on there was a rapid increase in the number of tested samples which peaked in week 8 reaching 196 samples except for week 7 when this number retreat to 128 samples the situation was different when we analyzed the number of positive samples in a given week the first positive samples were recorded at week 48 of 2017 158 of weekly samples a steady increase in influenza cases was reported from week 1 of 2018 235 positive exceeding 470 of the samples tested in week 11 the highest percentage of positive samples was recorded at week 10 of 2018 which amounted to 656 there was a decrease in the percentage of positive findings in the following weeks until week 16 when there was a drop to zero noted fig 1 comparing the recent epidemic seasons starting from 201415 up to 201718 an increase in the number of confirmed cases of influenza from 221 to 708 cases respectively is observed an increase also is observed in the percentage terms from 338 to 447 respectively although this increase has plateaued in the last season as the greatest amounting to 466 was observed in before last 201617 epidemic season table 1 in then 201718 epidemic season a total of 708 influenza infections and 28 influenza-like viral infections were confirmed of the 708 influenza infections 204 were due to influenza a virus and 504 due to influenza b virus influenza a infections were dominated by the subtype ah1n1pdm09 38 cases influenza-like infections viruses were dominated by respiratory syncytial virus 16 cases the findings of this study were reanalyzed in 7 successive age groups the highest percentage of influenza b infections was found in the age group of 4564 216 years while that of influenza a in the group of 2644 76 years the dominance of influenza a over b was found only in the youngest age group of 04 years there was a distinct dominance of influenza b virus in the remaining age groups fig 2 the probability of occurrence of influenza a or b virus infection was estimated in relation to a given age group of patients using the logistic regression model in which the age group of 65 was taken as reference we found that the probability of influenza a infection was three-fold greater among the patients aged 04 p  0001 and it was 50 lower than that of influenza b infection p  0028 compared with the reference group the probability of influenza a infection among the patients aged 59 was 25-fold greater than that in the reference group p  0005 in addition the probability of influenza b infection in the same age group of 59 years was 58 higher than that among the patients in the reference group p  0049 the differences between type a and b influenza infections in the remaining age groups as compared to the reference group were insignificant the sentinel influenza surveillance system is an essential tool for monitoring influenza in poland data from this system are key to determine the dynamics of season infections and to announce the epidemic by the relevant authorities in the country cielak et al 2018 lee et al 2018 comparing the increasing number of confirmed cases of influenza in the 201718 epidemic season in poland with other european countries we notice almost the same situation in germany single positive samples have been recorded since the seasons beginning ie week 40 of 2017 the highest number of cases and the highest percentage of positive samples over 60 were recorded there in week 9 which closely corresponds to the polish data in czech republic the threshold of over 60 of positive specimens was achieved already in week 5 and lasted until week 9 further the dominance of influenza type b has been reported there similarly to the epidemiological situation in poland concerning influenza type a subtype ah1n1pdm09 has also dominated flunews europe 2018 this trend has been different from that in the 201617 season when the subtype ah3n2dominated while the ah1n1pdm09 was not recorded cielak et al 2018 the first positive specimens in poland were recorded in week 48 which distinguishes the current season from the previous one the 201617 season started earlier because the threshold of 10 of positive tests has already been exceeded from week 46 onward adlhoch et al 2018 in the 201718 epidemic season the dominance of subtype ah1n1pdm09 among the influenza a subtypes was noticed most cases were reported among the patients of 2644 and 04 years of age a similar situation took place in the course of the 2009 pandemic when the subtype ah1n1pdm09 had infected mainly children and young adults while it was responsible for just 10 of hospitalization of the elderly verma et al 2012 in the previous 201617 influenza season ah3n2 dominated in terms of the percentage of influenza cases a subtype that is known for its propensity to infect the elderly pebody et al 2017 over the last four influenza epidemic seasons we have observed an increase in the percentage of confirmed influenza infections reported in the sentinel surveillance system that shows a steady improvement in the surveillance system and in the knowledge and ability to recognize and verify the infection and its type in the last two influenza seasons of 201617 and 201718 the percentage of confirmed cases ranged around 45 which means that almost every second patient was properly diagnosed by general practitioners the present report demonstrates the dynamics of the 201718 influenza season in poland according to the data from sentinel surveillance system the virological data are valuable in that they serve to accurately determine the antigenic composition of vaccine for the next epidemic season  antigenic drift of ah3n2virus and circulation of influenza-like viruses during the 20142015 influenza season in poland mieczyslaw pokorski k bednarska e hallmann-szeliska k kondratiuk l brydak b   influenza reappears every season and is caused by circulating influenza type a and type b viruses these viruses evolve through genetic mutations and resulting antigenic changes what allows them to evade host immunity influenza vaccines have to be updated periodically in order to be effective in the following season hence the constant need for seasonal vaccination as it takes approximately 6 months to produce influenza vaccines recommendations need to be done in advance the world health organization who convenes annual meetings in february and september each year to establish the composition of influenza vaccine for the forthcoming season in the northern and southern hemispheres respectively chambers et al 2015 who 2014a webster et al 2013 during the 20132014 season influenza atexas502012-like viruses were predominant among circulating influenza ah3n2 viruses in consequence this virus was recommended as a vaccine component in february 2014 new groups of ah3n2 viruses were detected in late march after vaccine manufacturing had begun that led to an antigenic mismatch between circulating viruses and viruses included in the vaccine for the 20142015 season ecdc 2014 who 2014b in the epidemic season 20142015 2416 clinical specimens were tested in poland additionally selected specimens from the voivodship sanitary epidemiological stations vses were tested at the national influenza center of the national institute of public health  national institute of hygiene as the reference laboratory in poland to verify the results obtained in those stations specimens for testing consisted mainly from nasal and throat swabs the patients were categorized into seven age-groups 04 59 1014 1525 2644 4564 and  65 years old viral rna was extracted using a maxwell 16 viral total nucleic acid purification kit promega corporation madison wi from 200 l of clinical samples in viral transport medium pbs in accordance with the manufacturers instructions for low elution volume lev cartridges the rna was eluted with 50 l of rnase-free water the rna virus samples were typed in the vses thus only subtyping of influenza viruses was achieved the detection of subtypes was performed by one-step real-time rt-pcr reaction performed using roche light cycler 20 system roche diagnostics rotkreuz switzerland rt-pcr reactions were performed in capillary tubes of 20 l volume with 05 l 20 nm primers and 05 l 5 nm probes for each reaction primers and probes were obtained through the influenza reagent resource irr program from the american centers for disease prevention and

seegene seoul south korea afterward amplicons were detected by gel electrophoresis the 20142015 influenza epidemic season in poland started in week 5 january february of 2015 and continued until week 17 april of 2015 the influenza activity was moderate with the highest incidence of influenza-like illness ili at week 102015 march fig 1
 during this season 2416 specimens were tested for influenza and influenza-like viruses of which 212  n  513 were positive for influenza in detail there were 341  n  175 influenza type b 146  75 influenza ah1n1pdm09 226  n  116 influenza ah3n2 and 287  n  147 non-subtyped influenza type a there was observed a co-circulation of influenza type a and b viruses with influenza a being the most prevalent one fig 2
 infections caused by influenza-like viruses accounted for 112  n  270 of tested specimens respiratory syncytial virus rsv was the other predominant virus constituting 870  n  235 of all ili cases followed by sporadic cases of human coronavirus n  10 37  parainfluenza virus-1 n  8 30  rhinovirus n  6 22  adenovirus n  5 19  and parainfluenza viruses 2 and 3 n  3 11  each fig 3
 the highest percentage of influenza and ili confirmed cases was noted in the 04 years age-group 464  followed by the 4564 years 123  and 2644 years age-groups 116  the lowest morbidity was observed in the 1525 years 49  and 1014 years age-groups 54  fig 4 the verification of specimen testing by vses demonstrated a complete agreement with the results obtained at the national influenza center table 1

 in the epidemic seasons 20132014 and 20142015 in poland the number of specimens received from primary care physicians was similar although the percentage of influenza and influenza-like infection confirmations was 10  higher in the latter season the 20142015 morbidity in children aged 04 years was twice as much as it had been in the former epidemic season the vast majority of infections in this group of children was induced by influenza-like viruses 672  in both seasons in the case of influenza-like viruses the predominant virus was rsv infections caused by other respiratory viruses occurred sporadically influenza cases were caused mainly by influenza type a 832  the proportion of influenza b was significantly higher in the 20142015 season than that in the previous season where it amounted to 12  of all influenza confirmations bednarska et al 2015 while comparing data from poland and europe it is apparent that the proportion of circulating viruses of influenza type a and b remains similar in europe and the whole world alike the dominant strain was ah3n2 but it co-circulated with influenza ah1n1pdm09 the predominance of the ah3n2 strain also was noted in poland even taking into account the fact that not all the specimens tested within the sentinel and non-sentinel influenza surveillance were subtyped broberg et al 2015 ecdcwho 2015 who 2015 mccauley et al 2014 2015 rolfes et al 2014 in the 20142015 season antigenic drift of the subtype ah3n2 decreased the effectiveness of vaccine against influenza yet vaccination remains the most effective and the cheapest method of influenza prevention broberg et al 2015 since 1968 the advisory committee on immunization practices acip recommends trivalent vaccines against influenza they contain two subtypes of influenza virus a and one lineage of influenza virus type b it should be emphasized that people particularly those who receive vaccination every season substantially enhance their immunological memory  human metapneumovirus associated with communityacquired pneumonia in children in beijing china

li et al 2009 chen et al 2010 xiao et al 2010 but few have investigated the role of hmpv in pediatric communityacquired pneumonia in the country in this study the demographics clinical manifestations and epidemiological features of hmpv infection in pediatric patients with communityacquired pneumonia in beijing were evaluated by rtpcr of hmpv rna in nasopharyngeal aspirates and analysis of clinical data using rsv a wellknown agent of pediatric communityacquired pneumonia as a control hmpv subtypes associated with communityacquired pneumonia were also assessed nasopharyngeal aspirates npas were obtained from 1028 pediatric patients who had a primary diagnosis of communityacquired pneumonia upon admission to the beijing childrens hospital from july 2008 through june 2010 the majority of the patients 742 were under 3 years old although age ranged from 03 month to 165 years mean age 3202 months median age 10 months the male to female ratio was 18 the diagnosis of communityacquired pneumonia followed a guideline issued by the chinese medical association in brief communityacquired pneumonia was clinically defined as the presence of signs and symptoms of

statistical analysis was performed using spss version 160 spss inc chicago il p value 005 was considered significant rtpcr analysis shows that hmpv rna was detected in 65 63 pediatric patients with communityacquired pneumonia 40 males and 25 females the detection rate of hmpv was only lower than that of rhinovirus 309 and respiratory syncytial virus rsv 307 but higher than that of other respiratory viruses including influenza virus 57 adenovirus 55 parainfluenza viruses 54 human coronavirus 50 human bocavirus 34 and enterovirus 24 these data indicate that hmpv plays an important role in pediatric communityacquired pneumonia in beijing hmpvpositive patients ranged in age from 1 month to 6 years mean age 1678 months median age 8 months hmpv was detected at a significantly higher rate in patients aged 36 months 79 than in those aged 361 months 19 2  11863 p  0001 the patients aged 36 months represented 742 of the subjects studied but accounted for 923 of the hmpvpositive

forming an epidemic peak between late autumn of 2008 and early spring of 2009 in the study year 20092010 the cocirculation of hmpva2 b1 and b2 was observed in january 2010 whereas cocirculation of hmpva2 and b2 was observed between march and june forming a small epidemic peak in the spring and early summer of 2010 fig 2 no hmpvpositive cases were detected in august and september 2008 or between april and december 2009 to characterize the clinical features of communityacquired pneumonia caused by hmpv the clinical manifestations of hmpvpositive and rsvpositive cases were compared to exclude the interference of coinfections only the cases with single hmpv or rsv infections were evaluated similar to rsv infection fever cough expectoration rhinorrhea wheezing and swelling of tonsils were the major symptoms observed in hmpvpositive patients with communityacquired pneumonia table iii there was no significant difference in major clinical manifestations gender ratio the history of pneumonia or congenital heart disease and laboratory data eg white blood cell counting hemoglobin and oxygen saturation between hmpvpositive and rsvpositive patients however the proportion of single hmpv infections was significantly lower 421 vs 685 2  5176 p  0023 than that of single rsv infections in children under 6 months old n  428 in this study hmpv subtypes as well as hmpv clinical and epidemiological characteristics associated with pediatric communityacquired pneumonia in beijing were analyzed the results show that hmpv plays an important role in pediatric communityacquired pneumonia in beijing china as hmpv infections accounted for 63 of the cases from july 2008 through june 2010 hmpv was detected at a lower rate in beijing than in a study population less than 5 years old in israel 83 wolf et al 2010 and in a study population less than 3 years old in spain 115 cilla et al 2008 however the hmpv detection rate in beijing was higher than that reported in brazil 41 for children younger than 5 years old nascimentocarvalho et al 2011 it was also higher than that in nepal for children less than 3 years old 42 mathisen et al 2010 and that in taiwan china for children less than 5 years old 52 lin et al 2005 these variable rates of hmpv detection may be attributed to variations in climate location and the populations studied similar to previous studies lin et al 2005 cilla et al 2008 wolf et al 2010 it was found that patients with communityacquired pneumonia positive for hmpv were coinfected with other respiratory viruses 40 of patients were coinfected with rsv and 213 with rhinovirus a higher rate of coinfection 708 than previously reported was observed in hmpvpositive patients in this study for instance the rate of hmpvrsv coinfection was 222 in israel wolf et al 2010 and 282 in spain cilla et al 2008 the reason for this difference is unclear but could be attributed to different detection methods a direct immunofluorescence assay dfa and tissue culture methods were used in the study in israel wolf et al 2010 whereas a nestedpcr or pcr method different from the rtpcr method employed here was used in the study in spain cilla et al 2008 in this study detection of bacteria in respiratory samples was not carried out because such detection cannot be used as evidence for infections in respiratory samples bogaert et al 2004 although there might have be a few communityacquired pneumonia cases in this study coinfected with bacterial pathogens these exceptions should not affect the major findings described here based on sequence analysis of the partial p gene of hmpv three hmpv subtypes a2 b1 and b2 were detected during the study period consistent with a previous study cilla et al 2008 hmpva2 was the most frequently detected subtype in pediatric patients with communityacquired pneumonia hmpva1 was not detected in this study hmpva1 was also not found in patients with other lower respiratory tract infections data not shown these results agree with those of previous reports from tianjin china li et al 2009 and from korea chung et al 2008 in contrast in taiwan china between february 2006 and february 2009 wang et al 2008 and in brazil between january 2003 and december 2006 oliveira et al 2009 all four hmpv subtypes were detected in patients with lower respiratory tract infections in another report from gansu province china between december 2006 and november 2008 hmpvb2 was not detected xiao et al 2010 whereas in chongqing china between april 2006 and march 2008 hmpva1 and hmpvb1 were not detected chen et al 2010 taken together with findings in this study these reports suggest that the prevalence of hmpv subtypes varies among different geographical locations long term surveillance of hmpv infections are needed to better understand the distribution of hmpv subtypes to prevent possible outbreaks and to inform vaccine development in summary the detection rate of hmpv ranked third in patients with communityacquired pneumonia and similar clinical manifestation was observed between hmpvpositive and rsvpositive patients these findings indicate that hmpv plays a significant role in pediatric communityacquired pneumonia in china the findings also provide a better understanding of the epidemiological and clinical features of hmpv infections  rapid detection of anti-h5 avian influenza virus

hibara yutaka yonezawa kunitoshi imai haruko ogawa manabu tokeshi   avian influenza is a poultry disease caused by influenza a virus infection influenza a virus has many subtypes based on the type of virus surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na wild aquatic birds are the primary natural host of influenza a virus and 16 has h1h16 and 9 nas n1n9 have been found so far in such birds 12 avian influenza virus aiv usually infects intestinal cells of aquatic birds and does not show pathogenicity however it can infect poultry and cause pathogenicity 34 the virus that causes a high mortality when poultry were infected is designated as a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus hpaiv to date some h5 and h7 subtype aivs have been reported to be hpaivs 5 6 7 8 h5n1 subtype hpaiv which appeared after 1996 has been reported not only in poultry but also in humans the mortality rate for humans infected with h5n1 is reported to exceed 50 9 if these hpaivs have acquired human-to-human infectivity the deaths of many persons world-wide due to a pandemic become a concern rapid initial response for a suspected infection and continuous surveillance are indispensable to prevent poultry epidemics of hpaiv and further human threats 1011 when a diagnosis is performed at the site of a disease outbreak a rapid simple and accurate antigen detection method is required on the other hand in the process from a disease occurrence to its cleanup and under a usual surveillance system antibody detection to check for previous infections also plays an important role even in poultry that do not currently have the virus the history of past infection can be determined by detecting antibodies this is essential for investigating the routes of transmission of infectious diseases as a recent example antibody tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 have received broad attention to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 1213 although some antibody tests such as the agar gel immunodiffusion test hemagglutination inhibition test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are used for the detection of anti-aiv antibody 14 15 16 17 18 these methods require complicated operations and a long reaction time therefore it is impractical to use these methods outside the laboratory if the method is developed that can rapidly and easily provide antibody test results outside the laboratory field applications become possible and the surveillance system using the antibody test can be significantly strengthened fluorescence polarization immunoassay fpia is widely used in various fields and it has the degree of polarization p as a parameter 1920 advantages of fpia compared to other immunoassays are the simplicity and rapidity of its procedures and the short measurement time fpia does not need a washing step and the reaction is completed by simply mixing the reagents together in this study we developed a system that selectively detected anti-h5 aiv serum by measuring p value of the mixture of an anti-aiv serum and fluorescein-labeled h5 subtype ha glycoprotein using a newly designed microdevice based on our previously developed microdevice with a portable fp analyzer 21 22 23 24 fig 1
a besides being portable our fp analyzer is low cost and has high throughput and these features make it possible to conduct fpia outside the laboratory all procedures from sampling to obtaining measurement results can be completed on-site and that contributes to a significant increase in efficiency of diagnosis and surveillance phosphate-buffered saline pbs ph 74 solution and micro bca protein assay kit were purchased from thermo fisher scientific inc waltham ma the sylgard 184 silicone elastomer kit for polydimethylsiloxane pdms microdevice fabrication was purchased from dow corning toray co ltd tokyo japan the pdms included black silicon rubber to decrease the background signal of fluorescence a negative photoresist su-8 3050 for pdms microdevice fabrication was purchased from nippon kayaku co ltd tokyo japan isogen-ls was purchased from nippon gene tokyo japan superscript iii reverse transcriptase was purchased from invitrogen carlsbad ca takara ex taq was purchased from takara shiga japan expression vector pet-32b and rosetta-gamitm 2 de3 plyss were purchased from novagen san diego ca isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside was purchased from wako pure chemical industries osaka japan nickelnitrilotriacetic acid ninta agarose was purchased from qiagen hilden germany lightning-link  rapid fluorescein was purchased from innova biosciences co ltd cambridge united kingdom as an antigen for the fpia recombinant h5 subtype aiv ha h5-rha was produced using the bacterial expression system as we previously described 25 with slight modifications briefly viral rna was extracted from h5n3 subtype aiv awhistling swanshimane4991983 26 the viral rna was extracted from the virus with isogen-ls and then reverse transcribed into cdna by using superscript iii reverse transcriptase for amplification of the partial ha gene aa 284425 pcr was performed using the takara ex taq and the following primers 5-ggccatggaactggagtatggtaactgt-3 and 5-ggccatggccattttcttatttaaatt-3 which include restriction enzyme site sequences underlined the pcr cycle included an initial cycle at 94  for 1 min then 30 cycles at 94  for 20 s 58  for 30 s and 72 for 2 min and a final extension at 72 for 7 min the pcr product was ligated into the expression vector pet-32b the expression vector prepared was used to transform the rosetta-gamitm 2 de3 plyss and isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside was used to induce the expression of the partial ha gene the protein extracted from the bacteria was purified using nickelnitrilotriacetic acid ninta agarose the recombinant protein obtained was concentrated using an ultrafiltration membrane and then dialyzed against pbs the recombinant protein was identified by western blotting using anti-h5 mouse serum and its concentration was measured by the micro bca protein assay kit the resultant h5-rha was labeled using the lightning-link fluorescein conjugation kit the goat antisera against h1h15 subtypes and the chicken antiserum against h16 subtype aiv were kindly provided by dr yoshihiro sakoda hokkaido university sapporo japan the immunogen of each serum is shown in table 1
 the basic pdms microfluidic device was fabricated using the standard soft lithography technique as described in our previous work 24 briefly the mold was fabricated from negative photoresist su-8 3050 and a silicon wafer sumco co tokyo japan the negative photoresist su-8 3050 was spin-coated onto a silicon wafer the pdms prepolymer with black silicon rubber was poured onto the mold and cured the cured pdms was pasted on a glass slide figs 1 b and c show a photograph and a schematic drawing of the microfluidic device we designed the microfluidic device for this experiment based on the basic device the microdevice had nine channels arranged in the field of view of the portable fp analyzer and nine samples could be measured at one time the width of the channel was 200 m and the depth is 900 m the depth of the microfluidic device was significantly different from our previous device by employing a channel having a high aspect ratio it was possible to increase the fluorescence intensity per unit area and reduce specific surface area these features contributed to highly sensitive measurement fig s1 the numbers in fig 1 c denote inlets and outlets and the solution was injected into the inlet with a pipet eppendorf hamburg germany we used our previously developed portable fp analyzer for fp measurement 24 this analyzer made the fp measurement based on the principle of synchronization between the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules and the sampling frequency of a cmos 21 22 23 thus p value could be obtained as a two-dimensional image an image of a microdevice captured by the cmos was processed to produce a p image according to the formula in the literature 21 using home-built image processing software the portable fp analyzer had dimensions of 65 cm w 35 cm  d 15 cm h 15 cm and a weight of 55 kg anti-aiv serum diluted in a prescribed ratio and 640 ngml fluorescein-labeled h5-rha were mixed at a volume ratio of 11 the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min then 20 l of the mixture was injected into the microfluidic device and p value was measured with our portable fp analyzer the fp analyzer acquired p images in the detection area the p value measured was determined by reading out the luminance on the p image in the detection area of the microdevice as shown in fig 1 c nine channels were placed within the detection area therefore nine samples could be measured simultaneously in the fpia measurement p value is expressed by the following equationp  i - i  i  iwhere i
 and i
 are the fluorescence intensities of the vertical and horizontal components of the emitted light respectively a free fluorescence-labeled antigen emits random fluorescence when excited by polarized light and it gives a low p value when a fluorescence-labeled antigen is bound to an antibody p value is high due to the much slower brownian motion of the antibody-h5-rha complex 1920 fig 2
shows the schematic illustration of fpia in this work when anti-h5 antibody in serum binds to a fluorescein-labeled h5-rha p value becomes high therefore anti-h5 aiv serum containing a large amount of anti-h5 ha antibodies shows a higher p value than that of the antibody-negative serum in this work we used the fragment of h5-rha not whole h5-rha as an antigen to improve the sensitivity using a smaller fluorescence-labeled antigen reduces p value of the blank sample fig 3
shows an example of a p image obtained using our portable fp analyzer samples used were a mixture of anti-h5 serum and fluorescein-labeled h5-rha and a mixture of anti-h14 serum and fluorescein-labeled h5-rha blank indicates only fluorescein-labeled h5-rha p value of each sample was calculated by analyzing the luminance value of each channel of this image by home-built image processing software first we confirmed whether the prepared fluorescein-labeled h5-rha binds with antibodies in anti-h5 aiv serum fig 4
shows p value as a function of incubation time after mixing the fluorescein-labeled h5-rha and anti-h5 serum the solution mixture was incubated in a microtube for a certain time before being injected into a microdevice and p value was measured with our portable fp analyzer time 0 means the fluorescein-labeled h5-rha solution without anti-h5 serum as the incubation time increased p value increased and became an almost constant value at 5 min therefore the change of p value due to the changing rotational motion of the fragment of recombinant h5 subtype aiv ha labeled by fluorescein could be detected by our analyzer in the next experiments the incubation period was set at 15 min at which time the reaction of the fluorescein-labeled h5-rha and a serum was sufficiently progressed then fig 5
shows the measured p value results after mixing fluorescein-labeled h5-rha and anti-h5 aiv serum diluted with pbs p value increased as the serum dilution rate decreased increased concentration the more antibodies the serum had the greater the number of antigen-antibody complexes that were formed in the excess amount of fluorescein-labeled h5-rha increasing p value with increasing concentration of serum meant that antigen-antibody complexes successfully formed therefore we concluded that this fluorescein-labeled h5-rha could be used for detection of anti-h5 antibody in serum the limit of detection was about 20-fold dilution our microdevice required 20 l of solution per one channel since serum and fluorescein-labeled h5-rha were mixed at a volume ratio of 1  1 the required serum volume for an analysis was 10 l when a serum with 5-fold dilution was used for the analysis the required volume of the original serum was 2 l it would be sufficiently small for application to on-site diagnosis and surveillance therefore 5-fold dilution of antiserum was used in the next experiment next we verified whether our system could selectively detect anti-h5 aiv serum in anti-h1h16 aiv sera fig 6
shows the p value obtained with anti-h1h16 sera the cutoff value for positive anti-h5 aiv antibody was defined as the average  3sds anti-h5 serum showed the highest p value among all anti-aiv sera and all other antisera except anti-h5 was below the cut-off value therefore we showed that there was no false positive result with other anti-subtype sera the incubation time was 15 min total analysis time was within 20 min which was significantly shorter than the time needed by conventional elisa-based devices these findings showed that our fpia system selectively detected the anti-h5 aiv serum we developed the rapid and easy-to-use system for the fpia detection of anti-h5 aiv serum analysis time was within 20 min and required sample volume was only 2 l our portable fp analyzer with the microfluidic device makes it possible to conduct on-site analysis further study on blocking of protein adsorption to pdms devices may lead to improved sensitivity and selectivity of a detection by designing fluorescence-labeled antigen this system can be applied to other viruses such as sars-cov-2 we may safely say that this system for antibody detection is ideal method for controlling infectious diseases by testing large numbers of samples in the future we plan to conduct experiments using real samples acquired in the field kn yt ks ah yy ki ho and mt conceived and designed the study kn and yt contributed to data collection and analysis of data kn yt mm ai ht ks ah yy ki ho and mt joined discussion and provided constructive suggestions kn and yt wrote the initial draft of the manuscript mm ai ht ks ah yy ki ho and mt critically reviewed and made improvements in the manuscript all authors approved the final version of the manuscript there are no conflicts to declare

 the majority of confirmations of influenza were found in the pomeranian 72 masovian 62 and subcarpathian 55 provinces in other provinces influenza was confirmed in less than half specimens investigated fig 1 and table 1
 we further found that the predominant subtype of influenza a virus in the 201516 season was ah1n1pdm09 that was detected in high percentage of influenza infection in several provinces such as pomerania 80 podlaskie 76 subcarpathia 74 lubuskie 71 silesia and warmia-masuria 69 with a smaller contribution from other provinces in two provinces swietokrzyskie and greater poland there was an equal frequency of type a and b viruses subtype ah3n2 accounted for one percent in the kuyavian-pomeranian and masovian provinces apart from the two subtypes there were unsubtyped cases of influenza infection 60 these infections occurred most frequently in the province of opole table 2
 type b virus predominated in west pomerania 69 of infections and also accounted for a substantial share of more than one third of the confirmed cases in lesser poland table 2 influenza-like infections ili accounted for over 20 of all infections in the opole and greater poland provinces in other regions of the country these infections were rather sporadic fig 1 the respiratory syncytial virus was the most common cause of ili other viruses such as human metapneumovirus adenovirus coronavirus 229enl63 parainfluenzavirus 1-3 coronavirus oc43 and rhinovirus ab were identified in individual cases in the 201516 epidemic season in poland over three thousand respiratory virus infections were confirmed there were 3864731 cases and suspected cases of influenza and influenza-like illness 15312 hospitalizations and 140 deaths niph-nih 2016 most cases and suspected cases were reported in the pomeranian 765296 masovian 689370 and greater poland 546357 provinces as shown in fig 1 the highest incidence per 100000 population was in pomerania 43837 and greater poland 20862 the predominant subtype ah1n1pdm09 accounted for over 70 of confirmed cases of influenza infections it should be noted that the who provides that each year from 330 million to 158 billion people worldwide suffer from influenza and influenza-like infections who 2015 a high percentage of infection by subtype ah1n1pdm09 may stem from a low level of vaccination coverage in poland amounting to about 36 of the population brydak 2016 this subtype was recommended as a component of influenza vaccine in the 201516 epidemic season who 2015 and it also is going to be included into the 201617 vaccine who 2016 influenza virus type b was the most frequent in the west pomerianian and swietokrzyskie provinces accounting for more than half of the confirmed infections table 1 a similar number of cases of influenza b and influenza-like infections was observed in the opole and greater poland provinces amounting to about 30 each the majority of deaths occurred in the region of silesia 33 in which the most frequently detected virus was influenza type a there also were 25 deaths reported in greater poland where virus type a 39 b 32 and viruses causing influenza-like illness 29 were at a grossly comparable level the who estimates that 1 million people die each year due to influenza infection brydak 2012 the present virological data indicate the predominance of infection with influenza virus type a in the eastern polish provinces subcarpathian 91 lublin 80 and podlaskie 74 lying near the border with russia these infection may be related to border trafficking between the two countries as type a virus was confirmed as predominant from week 3 of 2016 in russia kimissarov et al 2016 however predominance of type a virus in 201516 was also confirmed in slovakia ukraine belarus and lithuania flu news europe 2016 a decline in the number of confirmed cases of influenza virus subtype ah3n2 which accounted for only 1 in the kuyavian-pomerianian and masovian provinces was observed in 201516 compared with that in 201415 bednarska et al 2015 a situation similar to that also noted in russia where this subtype caused only sporadic infections kimissarov et al 2016 in contrast predominance of influenza virus type b was observed the west pomerania that lies west of the provinces above mentioned near germany where type b virus was found to predominate in the 201516 influenza season flu news europe 2016 therefore it seems that the regional differences in the type of influenza virus causing infections in a given season have in all probability to do with the epidemiological situation in neighboring countries  the application of dna nucleotide footprint plotting in coronavirus samuel krem   coronaviruses are new viruses although there have been many timely discoveries for this virus there are still many things unknown 13 i designed a novel tool named the dna nucleotide footprint plotter it can distinguish different types of viruses such as coronavirus sars-cov-2 sars-cov virus hiv virus and influenza virus as indicated in fig 1 fig 2 fig 3 fig 4
 it was also used to compare the complete sequence of covid-19 corona strain with oc43 hku1 mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome sars-cov fig 5
 as well as different subtypes of corona viruses fig 12 fig 13 fig 14 fig 15 fig 16 the characteristics of hundreds of virus genomes and gene segments have been displayed by dna footprint plotter data not all shown this application has the capability to display the exact changes that occur in nucleotide position of nonstructural and structural regions of the novel different complete genome of covid-19 corona strains fig 6 even if the method is designed to observe structural changes at the genomic level that single nucleotide polymorphism calling tools cannot identify it is possible to show genotype changes and amino acid changes at a single nucleotide resolution in addition dna footprint plotter is a useful tool to determine the evidence of recombination a recombination between corona virus mt121215 and influenzavirus hc668016 was simulated by making a fasta file containing the beginning of the flu genome and the end of the corona virus genome as demonstrated in fig 7 the simulated recombination created a chimera of partial flu virus and partial corona virus the genome sequences of coronavirus sars-cov-2 sars-cov virus oc43 hku1 mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome hiv virus and influenza virus were downloaded from ncbi virus data hub 4 httpswwwncbinlmnihgovlabsvirusvssi
 the figures have an x axis and a y axis there are three ways to plot dna footprint plots they are acat agac and atag acat is used as an example if the nucleotide is a then x value plusses 1 x1 if the nucleotide is t then x value minuses 1 x-1 if the nucleotide is c then y value plusses 1 y1 if the nucleotide is g then y value minuses 1 y-1 agac and atag use the same logic the three types of footprint of coronavirus2china homosapiensnc045512 are displayed in fig 8 fig 9 fig 10
as examples the framework of the script is shown in fig 11
 the program was written in java the three types of footprint plots look different i only use acat plot in the virus genome structure comparisons in the current paper the method aims to demonstrate structural variations at higher levels that single nucleotide mutation callers cannot identify however the tool can precisely demonstrate single nucleotide information fig 6 the method itself has no limit to plot the number of nucleotide bases but due to the size of computer screens and paper too many bases will cause the lines to overlay each other thus the sizes of virus genome or segments of eukaryote genome are recommended for one particular plot one plot can display a complete virus genome and users can combine multiple plots together to visualize more complicated genomes such as the genomes of eukaryotes or if only a partial virus genome or a particular gene are of interest the corresponding regions can be displayed by dna foot plotter coronavirus demonstrates a unique footprint fig 1 and so do other types of viruses fig 2 fig 3 fig 4 fig 5 the dna nucleotide footprints are different in different types of viruses and it makes it convenient to distinguish one type of virus from another to compare two coronavirus subtypes i overlapped their footprint plots and let one cancel another if they are the same in this way we can see the differences between them the coronavirus in fig 12 fig 13 fig 14 fig 15 are from mainland china mt121215 taiwan mt066176 japan lc529905 and italy mt066156 they were compared with one type of coronavirus from the usa mt188340 dna footprint can quickly distinguish the infection type of patients given the sequencing data it can demonstrate the characteristics of different types of viruses and increase the confidence of diagnosis such as flu coronavirus or sars-cov in addition to specific visualization of coronavirus genome key features it can be applied to recognize various virus genomes in general and to compare subtypes of the same virus species the better understanding of virus genomes will lead to a more accurate diagnosis which lays the foundation of appropriate therapeutic options it can also help the prevention of the disease by guiding vaccine design one example is that the tool can display which regions are similar among various virus subtypes and which regions are different this will facilitate the design of vaccines targeting similar regions among different virus sub-species in this way one vaccine can fight different types of viruses dna footprint plotter is useful for character identification at the genome level it can identify key features in the genome that single nucleotide mutation callers will miss it can also be used as an add-on tool of phylogenic trees phylogenic trees are very useful to group and compare viruses but the detailed differences are not shown if we can also apply dna footprint plot people will have a better idea regarding which regions are similar and which regions are different as well as the patterns of differences in addition to viruses dna footprint plots can be applied to visualize single genes or groups of genes in higher organisms to facilitate the understanding of gene structure it can also help to identify disease-causing structural variations such as repeats in diseases like huntingtons disease if we digitalize the key features of the footprint shapes within genomes and genes we can use machine learning such as neural networks to recognize various viruses and genes 5 dna footprint plotter is a novel tool to display the characteristics of virus genome genes and sections of eukaryote genome it is a quick and convenient method to visualized the features of corona virus dna to distinguish them from other viruses and to

of hiv transmission in 2002 and 2003 none of the reported cases came from the drug injecting community in 2004 however 18 of the 30 reported hiv infections 60 were found in idus we examined the sequences of the hiv-1 strains from idus in order to determine whether there was a common source for the outbreak and to assess the relationship among similar sequences in other parts of the world a total of 14 hiv-infected idu samples genbank accession numbers listed in figure 1
 collected from 2002 through 2007 by the macao public health laboratory were examined nested pcr followed by sequencing was performed to obtain the gag pol and env fragments we used sample sequences of polymerase of 634 bp regions covered protease 256297 reverse transcriptase rt 1592 gag of 284296 bp p17 144396 p24 143 and envelope of 242249 bp gp160 9081158 gp120 9081158 to align with reference sequences retrieved from the los alamos national laboratory hiv database httpwwwhivlanlgov the resulting neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees are shown in figure 1 ac the results revealed 11 unusual cases which showed characteristics of crf12bf n
  2 and crf14bg n
  8 and one that could not be classified into an existing subtypecrf along with three cases of crf01ae antiviral drug resistance analysis httpwwwhivlanlgovcontentsequenceadraadra2html showed no special drug resistance mutations in the pol sequences in addition since six samples were epidemiologically linked mo007 mo021 mo106 mo108 mo112 mo113 one of the samples mo108 was subtyped by rega subtyping tool after whole genome sequencing figure 2
 in the figure it can be seen that it is a triple recombinant bfg except for the three crf01ae sequences probably originated from the same southeast asian region the sequences derived from subtypes bg and bf recombinants have not been previously reported in any other asian cities including the neighboring areas of hong kong and mainland china5 to study the possible geographical origins of these sequences a blast search was performed and the genbank records and literature of the matches were studied samples mo008 and mo009 from two portuguese manifesting characteristics of subtype g matched with sequences from spain and portugal whereas the monophyletic group similar to crf12bf mo007 mo021 mo106 mo108 mo111 mo112 mo113 and mo114 matched with sequences mainly from brazil and a few from europe supplementary table the high query coverage and high similarity in gag and pol regions of mo008 and mo009 suggested that the year of first hiv-positive diagnosis was around 2000 which is in concordance with our records sample mo010 shared characters of both bf and bg recombinants  its gag shared some similarity with that of mo008 while its pol and env shared some similarity with mo108 implying a recombination event the key question is how the two uncommon strains emerged crf12bf circulates in south america and has been reported to be associated with sexual idu and mother-to-child transmission4 6 7 although a major human migration between macao and south america seems unlikely as a colony administered by portugal before 1999 migration between macao and europe could reasonably have occurred the most common hiv subtypes in portugal are b g and crf14bg8 9 coincidentally a cluster of crf12bf was reported in idus in southern portugal in 2003 shortly before the macao outbreak10 subtype f strain has also been reported in the european countries of spain2 portugal8 and italy11 the temporal and spatial information alongside the blast results suggests that idus in portugal could have acquired crf12bf from south america and in turn introduced the strain into macao another subtype crf14bg has also been introduced into macao among the idus in conclusion human activity including travel over long distances and injection drug usage have fueled the spread of hiv and have provided a platform for recombination which may otherwise have taken years to happen no conflict of interest to declare  vigor an annotation program for small viral genomes shiliang wang jaideep sundaram p david spiro   rapid and cost effective genomic surveillance of rna viruses is a critical component of vaccine and drug development pipelines for the control of emerging viral diseases improvements in sequencing technology and the concomitant decrease in costs have made it easier and more common for the re-sequencing of large genomes as well as parallel sequencing of small genomes this has led to an exponential increase in the genomic data available in public databases however accurate gene prediction is a challenge that has created a bottleneck in the gene predication pipeline two major approaches ab initio gene finding and similarity-based prediction 1 have been commonly applied to gene prediction the ab initio method also known as the intrinsic statistical strategy computes statistical data such as the nucleotide frequencies and their ordering in a set of genomic sequences that have been characterized this is because the nucleotide frequencies and ordering for each genome usually differ between protein coding and non-coding regions however viral genomes because of their small genome sizes may not provide sufficient training data to derive the parameters necessary to attain the best performance possible for this approach the heuristic method which determines the parameters of the necessary models from short sequences was adopted by several gene prediction programs eg genemarks 2 small amount of genomic sequence but long enough to produce the efficient markov models usually a small fraction of large genome or small genomes like viral genomes is needed for this method the linear function reflecting the relationship between the nucleotide frequencies in the three codon positions and the global nucleotide frequencies is obtained by analyzing the small amount of dna sequence these derived data will be used to predict protein coding genes by the heuristic method 3 the ab initio method uses these trained or self-trained modules to select the protein coding regions and predict coding sequences the similarity-based method predicts protein coding sequences by a different strategy identifying gene coding sequences by sequence similarity alignment to reference sequences which are closely related evolutionarily since these two approaches use different strategies to detect the protein coding sequences the performances are different and depend on the training data set and reference sequence data usually ab initio approach is more sensitive than similarity-based approach while the performance of similarity-based method has greater specificity this is because ab initio methods predict some false positive exons and genes in intergenic regions and introns while similarity-based tools cannot detect genes if the homologous sequences are not included in the reference data although most viral genomes are relatively small compared to eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes the gene structure of viral genomes can be complex for example introns alternative splicing overlapping genes and ribosomal slippage exist in many viral genomes thus an all purpose gene finder cannot be easily adapted for gene prediction across all virus families however if the genome scaffold and the gene features of a viral genome are well understood a similarity-based gene prediction approach based on the curated gene repertoire for a specific virus genus with attention to particular recognition features such as splice sites and mature peptide cleavage sites can be adapted and perform better than an ab initio gene finder the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid funds a genomic sequencing center for infectious diseases gscid at the j craig venter institute jcvi one of the goals of the gscid is high throughput sequencing of various viral pathogens the viral genome sequencing projects at jcvi have resulted in publication of more than 4000 influenza virus genomes from clinical and animal reservoir specimens and hundreds of coronavirus and rotavirus sequences prediction of protein coding genes encoded in these viral genomes is a critical step to understanding these pathogenic viruses in order to have a flexible accurate gene prediction tool for utilization in high throughput viral genome sequencing projects we developed a viral annotation program vigor viral genome orf reader vigor uses a similarity-based approach to detect open reading frames orf in various viral genomes by similarity searches against custom reference protein sequence databases vigor takes into account differences between the genomic structures of viral taxonomic groups vigor is tailored for the designated viruses with complex gene features such as splicing and frame-shifting and it is able to predict genes accurately in influenza group a b and c coronavirus including sars coronavirus rhinovirus and rotavirus genomes it was also designed to assign function to the predicted orfs and genotype influenza viruses in addition to gene prediction vigor can also be used as a tool to validate sequence accuracy and completeness during the genome finishing process complete protein sequences of all orfs for influenza virus rotavirus rhinovirus and coronavirus subtypes were downloaded from genbank and redundant sequences were removed by custom scripts for coronavirus and sars coronavirus both the orf1a polypeptide sequences and orf1b polypeptide sequences were included in the coronavirus and sars coronavirus reference database similarity searches between viral genomic sequences and a custom protein database are conducted by blastx 4 the longest aligned region detected by the similarity search spanning one single protein sequence plus 100 bases upstream and downstream sequences is selected as the potential coding region for the particular open reading frame this region is then further searched for genomic features indicative of the coding region a similarity search is performed again between the potential coding region and the custom protein database the protein sequence with highest identity in the similarity search is established as the reference sequence for the identification of the start and stop codons if the first codon in the potential coding sequence is atg and aligns with the first residue in the reference sequence this atg is selected as the start codon otherwise the nearest upstream in-frame atg is selected as the start codon if no in-frame atg is present in the upstream region of the aligned sequences the 60 nucleotides downstream of the first aligned residue are scanned for the start codon sequences downstream of the last aligned residue of the potential coding sequence are scanned for in-frame stop codons taa tga and tag and the closest stop codon to the last aligned residue is selected mature mrna for the influenza m2 and ns2 genes is produced by internal splicing the conserved splice donor and acceptor sites gtag 5 are scanned around the alignment joint sites between the gap and aligned regions the splice sites which result in the best alignment between the translated protein and the reference sequence are selected the two main criteria for the selection of splice sites are identity to reference sequence and sequence length of the translated protein however if these two do not agree with each other sequence length has priority in choosing the final splice sites the first transcript of coronavirus genomes and sars coronavirus genomes encodes two polyproteins because of ribosomal slippage during translation 6 the first polyprotein orf1a is translated from the sequence with start and stop codons and normal translation while the synthesis of the second polyprotein orf1ab is dependent on a -1 nucleotide ribosomal frameshift induced by a slippery sequence of the type uuuaaac upstream of the orf1a stop codon 7 vigor examines the region upstream of the orf1a stop codon to map out precisely the uuuaaac string it then shifts back the reading frame by -1 nucleotide from aac to aaa within the slippery sequence and the -1 frame is extended to generate the coding sequence for the translation of orf1ab there are 16 subtypes for hemagglutinin protein ha and 9 subtypes for neuraminidase na in group a influenza viruses but only one subtype for ha and one subtype for na for influenza b viruses 89 the genotypes of influenza viruses can be categorized by the hemagglutinin protein ha and neuraminidase na in the custom vigor database ha and na subtype sequences are stored and used to categorize the genotypes of these two influenza proteins based on the best similarity the rhinovirus polyprotein is cleaved into 11 mature functional peptides by proteases there are conserved cleavage signature sequences for 9 cleavage sites 10 in order to predict mature peptides the polyprotein sequence is aligned with the sequences in vigors custom rhinovirus mature peptide database to identify the mature peptide cleavage sites in the absence of a conserved signature sequence the putative cleavage site whose products result in best alignments for both sequence length and similarity is selected the conserved mature peptide cleavage signature sequences for the orf1a and orf1ab of sars coronavirus derived from sequence comparative alignment and literature 11-13 at the position p1 the position just before the cleavage site is the conserved glutamine q the signature residue recognized by papain-like proteinase mature peptide cleavage sites are determined by mature peptide length and conserved cleavage signature sequences i coding sequences must have both start and stop codons or span the 5 or 3-end of the input sequences for partial genomic sequences ii there should not be an internal stop codon or frameshift in the coding sequences except for the orf1ab in coronavirus genomes and sars coronavirus genomes iii the exon number must be the same as that of the homologous gene in the custom database iv the translated product of the coding region must span 95 of the length of the homologous protein unless the homolog in the reference database is shorter than 50 amino acids except influenza genomes for influenza genes if the encoded protein is 500 amino acids or longer pb2 pb1 pa and ha the translated product must span more than 98 of the length of the reference protein the length difference between the translated product and the reference protein should be within 5 amino acids for ns2 and m2 genes shorter than 150 aa the encoded ns mp np and na proteins should not be 15 amino acid shorter than reference proteins v if any of these criteria is not observed the sequence region homologous to reference sequences will be identified as a non-functional gene region and will be marked as a possible sequence mutation vigor is available at httpwwwjcviorgvigor viral genomic sequences in either fasta or multi-fasta format can be pasted or uploaded from a local file into the input sequence area through a gui interface which was implemented in perl cgi php and javascript vigor is supported by a multi-tiered backend service called arcturus this service includes the capability to receive and process all types of web form submissions the submission component transforms the submitted data into a job and the queuing component schedules the job for processing a post-processing component formats the results and notifies the submitter that the gene predictions can be viewed following the completion of the job arcturus is responsible for invoking the appropriate gene prediction program in the vigor package for the specified virus type currently all jobs are executed on a single dedicated server the backend service is implemented to support scalability the entire backend service was implemented in perl a user needs to select the virus type through a pull-down virus name menu prior to submitting the sequence data the user will be informed of the link to download the prediction result by email following the vigor run the output includes three files the main output file is the gene prediction file which includes the predicted peptide sequence length coordinates of the coding regions splice sites if applicable protein function and genotype if available and the predicted amino acid sequences the other two output files are the cdna sequence file and a file of the alignment between the predicted protein and the best match in the custom database so that the user can evaluate the prediction if mutations which generate internal stop codons or frameshifts are detected the mutated sequences plus the flanking sequences will be presented in the output the alignment data from the blastx search is also included in the gene prediction file the influenza virus genome consists of eight rna segments that encode one or two proteins each splicing is involved in the expression of the mp and m2 proteins from segment 7 mp segment in group a influenza viruses and ns1 and ns2 proteins from segment 8 ns segment in both group a and group b viruses 16 segment 2 pb1 segment encodes two proteins pb1 and pb1-f2 in some influenza genomes the coding sequence of pb1-f2 is completely embedded in the pb1 coding region with a different reading frame 17 in order to test its accuracy in gene finding 2376 full and partial influenza segment sequences including group a group b and group c viruses encoding 3177 annotated proteins were run through vigor vigor predicted 3178 orfs encoded by these segments among these predicted protein sequences 99 31693178 orfs completely agreed with the annotations in genbank three predicted orfs were partially correct and one orf was incorrectly predicted table 1 the influenza sequence set was also run through flan influenza specific gene prediction program the specificity and sensitivity of flan are quite comparable to vigor table 1 however 47 genes annotated in genbank were predicted as non-functional genes by flan because of different problems detected in these sequences including internal stop codons frame shifts or incorrect splicing these predictions were marked as discrepancies in table 1 nine small orfs detected by flan were missing from the vigor prediction list all of these were homologous to pb1-f2 protein these pb1-f2 proteins predicted by flan were manually compared to the homologous pb1-f2 sequences it was found that multiple stop codons are present in the region homologous to the n-terminal domain of pb1-f2 although the annotations in genbank for 6 of these nine sequences are same as flan predictions most likely all these nine sequences encode non-functional pb1-f2 genes the same set of influenza genomic sequences was also run using genemarks and zcurvev two ab initio approach gene prediction tools for viral genomes table 1 the specificity and sensitivity for genemarks was 4063 and 3522 respectively while the specificity and sensitivity for zcurvev was 8174 and 7227 similar numbers of genbank annotated genes were missed by both genemarks 770 genes and zcurvev 841 genes manual inspection showed that the majority of the overlooked genes were pb1-f2 ns2 and m2 genes several studies have shown that embedded genes and splicing often pose problems for viral gene prediction algorithms 214 for example zcurvev could not identify the tat gene correctly and missed the rev completely when it was used to predict genes for the hiv-i virus 14 additionally almost half of the genemarks predictions for influenza genomes picked start codons upstream of the correct start codons rotavirus genomes are made up of 11 segments of double stranded rna encoding 6 viral structural proteins vp1-4 vp6-7 and 6 non-structural proteins nsp1-6 non-structural protein 5 and 6 are encoded by same genomic segment the coding regions overlap but are in different reading frames 18 19 g types and 27 p types of rotaviruses based on structural proteins vp7 and vp4 were recorded we downloaded from genbank 1166 rotavirus sequence segments with 1158 annotated genes and ran in parallel vigor zcurvev and genemarks analyses vigor predicted 1202 protein coding genes including 44 newly detected orfs which were not annotated in genbank three predictions picked different start codons compared to the annotations in genbank these new predictions were examined closely and all of them are homologous to nsp6 with very good similarities e-value  1e-10 data not shown zcurvev performed well for rotavirus genome gene prediction table 1 1112 of the 1171 predictions were the same as the annotations in genbank both the specificity and sensitivity are approximately 95 only one protein coding gene was not picked by zcurvev and 45 were predicted with different start codons the performance of genemarks was limited for rotavirus gene prediction approximately 64 of the predictions 776 predictions selected the wrong start codons table 1 the rhinovirus genome encodes one polyprotein precursor which is cleaved into eleven functional mature peptides 20 thirty-six annotated rhinovirus genomes were downloaded from genbank and tested with vigor genemarks and zcurvev vigor correctly predicted the polypeptide start codon and stop codon as well as the mature peptides for each genome see table 2 genemarks identified all 36 polyproteins but predicted the wrong start codons for four genomes an additional nine small orfs were incorrectly predicted in the 5-utr zcurvev predicted 77 genes in total including the 36 true orfs and 41 mis-predicted small peptides the start codons of 6 real open reading frames were not correctly predicted vigor was also used to predict the polyproteins and mature peptides for 66 atcc rhinovirus samples and field samples sequenced at jcvi with 100 specificity and sensitivity 21 neither genemarks nor zcurvev was designed to predict mature peptide sequences for viral genomes coronavirus genomes are 27 to 31 kb in size and encode 9-15 proteins the genomic structure of each species in the coronavirus genus is highly variable 6 with considerable species diversity among the non-structural proteins the first open reading frame occupies about 23 of the genome and ribosomal slippage occurs in the expression of this transcript producing two polypeptides orf1a and orf1ab which are cleaved into functional mature peptides coronavirus genomes also encode overlapping genes and genes which are completely embedded within other genes to evaluate the performance of vigor for coronavirus gene prediction 38 annotated complete coronavirus genomes containing annotation for 341 genes were downloaded from genbank and run through vigor genemarks and zcurvev vigor identified 354 orfs while genemarks and zcurvev predicted 314 and 339 protein coding genes respectively table 2 of the 341 genbank annotated genes vigor correctly predicted 339 genes missed one gene and identified one gene with wrong start codon table 2 vigor also predicted 14 new orfs which were not annotated in genbank manual curation of these 14 newly predicted proteins showed that they are highly similar e value  1e-10 to annotated coronavirus or other viral proteins data not shown thus we classified these 14 newly identified genes in coronaviruses as correct predictions of the 341 annotated genes genemarks and zcurvev did not detect 48 and 34 genes respectively most of the missing genes were short overlapping genes the small structural envelope protein coding gene in 10 coronavirus genomes was not identified by either of these two programs because the coding region of this envelope protein overlaps with the coding region of an upstream gene vigor was also evaluated and used successfully for the gene prediction of more than 50 coronavirus genomes sequenced at jcvi the specificity and sensitivity were greater than 99 22-25 vigor has been adjusted as well to optimally predict the protein coding genes in sars coronavirus genomes we downloaded from genbank 102 annotated sars coronavirus genomes containing a total of 1322 annotated genes vigor genemarks and zcurvev were run for these sars coronavirus genomes to identify protein coding genes vigor detected 1447 orfs 1321 of which completely agreed with the annotations in genbank table 2 only one genbank annotated gene was missing on the vigor prediction list vigor also found 126 orfs in these sars coronavirus genomes which were not annotated in genbank by searching the ncbi nr database the similarity search showed that these 126 newly detected genes encode proteins highly similar e value  1e-10 to proteins in sars coronavirus or other viruses zcurvev predicted 1204 genes 958 of which were identical to the annotations in genbank one hundred seven zcurvev predictions have different start codons compared to the annotations in genbank table 2 this program also detected 76 new orfs which did not exist in genbank as with vigor the encoded proteins are highly similar to other viral proteins in genbank data not shown sixty-three predictions may be incorrect since they could not be corroborated by similarity searches these were either small peptides shorter than 50 aa or were located within the first long open reading frame genemarks detected only 941 genes and 680 of them were precise predictions one hundred nineteen predictions hit the correct regions with the correct frame but the start codons were incorrect table 2 genemarks also picked 21 new orfs which are similar to other viral proteins one hundred twenty-one genemarks predictions may be incorrect since no homologous proteins could be found in genbank two hundred fifty-seven and 523 genbank annotations were missing on the zcurvev and genemarks prediction list these missing genes were examined closely and most of them are overlapping genes such as non-structural protein 3b 9b envelope protein or the gene encoding a non-structural protein which is completely embedded within the coding region of nucleocapsid protein the gene predictions from two sars coronavirus genomes nc009695 and ay485277 are detailed in table 3 nc009695 is the genomic sequence of a bat sars-like coronavirus published in 2005 26 the annotations have been updated several times by different annotators this genome encodes 14 orfs in genbank vigor predicted 13 orfs and detected one mutation which resulted in a truncated non-functional peptide table 3 the 13 predicted orfs were exactly the same as the annotations in genbank the mutation detected by vigor is located in orf3b and generates an internal stop codon creating truncated peptide of 114 amino acids the orf3b gene in other coronaviruses is 154 aa long we believe this truncated protein is non-functional zcurvev identified 11 orfs but missed the two short orfs 28094-28387 28544-28756 which are completely embedded in the coding region of the nucleocapsid protein genemarks detected 8 orfs but ignored 3 additional orfs one was the envelope protein gene 26056-26286 and the other two were non-structural protein genes 27573-27707 27713-28082 both genemarks and zcurvev did not predict the orf1ab correctly ay485277 is another sars coronavirus genome that has 8 orfs annotated in genbank 27 vigor predicted an additional 7 orfs table 3 these 7 orfs were corroborated by comparing them with other viral proteins in genbank zcurvev detected 12 orfs including 5 orfs which were not annotated in genbank these 5 orfs are highly homologous to other viral proteins one orf annotated in genbank and two orfs predicted by vigor were ignored by zcurvev genemarks identified 9 orfs three genbank annotated genes were missing and 3 vigor predictions were also missing from the genemarks prediction list neither genemarks nor zcurvev predicted orf1ab protein correctly two ab initio gene prediction programs zcurvecov 28 and genedecipher 29 were specifically trained and the program parameters were adjusted for sars coronavirus genomes both programs can correctly predict the major large protein coding genes and structural protein coding genes like polyprotein orf1a orf1ab spike gene nucleocapsid gene envelope gene and membrane protein gene however short peptide genes and embedded genes were often missing on the predicted gene list false negative 29 although the exact function of these small peptide genes is unknown mature peptide prediction is not a designed function for these two programs 17 of the 18 sars-cov genomes tested by genedecipher were used to evaluate vigor predictions since there were no annotations for most of these genomes in genbank sars-cov genome tor2 genome was annotated in genbank and predictions were listed 29 a detail comparison was done for this genome data not shown the predictions of vigor for sars-cov genome tor2 were exactly same as the genbank annotations genedeciper didnt pick 6 small non-structural protein genes and predicted one gene incorrectly the genome structure and genes of the other 16 tested sars-cov genomes are same as sars-cov genome tor 2 14 genes and one non-functional non-structural protein gene were detected in these genomes by vigor vigor has been used extensively to validate the genomes in the finishing process for the high-throughput virus sequencing projects at jcvi 21-2530 in this role vigor is used to detect sequence changes which generate a premature stop codon or a frameshift the potential sequence error and the flanking sequences as well as the blastx alignment results are presented in the prediction output this data allows researchers working on finishing tasks to investigate whether the sequence changes are due to laboratory error or are biologically relevant snps or indels we noticed that if a mutation or a sequence error generates a pre-mature stop codon or causes frame-shift and the translated product still meets all criteria stated above vigor will predict this gene as a functional gene in this type of cases vigor prediction may not be able to identify the potential sequence errors however vigor provides the alignment data between the predicted peptide and reference sequence in the output alignment file users can use the alignment data to evaluate the prediction and identify the potential sequence errors if a genomic sequence covers only a fraction of a gene coding region vigor will identify this genomic sequence as partial sequence genome finishing team is able to pursue finishing the genome basing the missing regions identified by vigor vigor has also been used in the gene annotation and submission process one of the advantages of vigor is that it can be used on large numbers of viral genomes simultaneously the efficiency of vigor varies depending on the viral sequence type used as input for example using four hundred and fifty eight influenza genomes 6 mb in total of nucleotide sequences vigor took 85 minutes to complete the gene predictions in comparison it took vigor 23 minutes to execute the gene prediction for 102 sars coronavirus genomes 3 mb in total nucleotide sequences we have demonstrated that vigor a rna virus gene prediction tool can predict protein coding genes with high accuracy for 5 different rna virus types influenza virus rotavirus rhinovirus coronavirus and sars coronavirus vigor is available for public use at httpwwwjcviorgvigor vigor has been thoroughly field tested in several high throughput genome sequencing projects at the jcvi vigor has been employed to predict the protein coding genes successfully for 51 newly sequenced group a rotavirus complete genomes sequenced at jcvi 30 and to annotate and predict mature peptides for 66 rhinovirus full genome sequences 21 the similarity based program has been also used to annotate the published sequences of bovine feline human murine rat sars and several novel wild animal coronavirus genomes 22-25 partial genomes and the potential sequence errors which generate pre-mature stop codons or frameshifts were identified by vigor as well during the genome finishing process for these viral sequencing projects vigor detects protein coding sequences based on similarity searches in conjunction with the known genome specific features for the particular viral genomes genes with introns overlapping genes and even the genes with a frameshift due to ribosomal slippage can be identified accurately because vigor includes these complex mechanisms in the processing for the designated genomes both the specificity and sensitivity of vigor for the tested genomes was greater than 99 the same sets of viral genomes were tested for two existing universal viral gene predication methods the specificity was between 31 and 95 and the sensitivity was from 35 to 96 vigor was designed to predict the mature peptides accurately for rhinovirus genomes and sars coronavirus genomes which is not applicable for the existing universal gene prediction tools vigor can also conduct genotyping and assign function to the predicted protein both of which are not capable for most available viral gene prediction tools this user-friendly program is convenient for high throughput sequencing projects and for use by individual laboratories if reference protein sequences can be collected and genome specific features are added to vigor this program can extend its capability to predict the protein coding genes in many other small viral genomes  project name vigor  project home page httpwwwjcviorgvigor  operating systems platform-independent  programming language perl and php  any

hossein soleimani mehdi yousefi hossein kafil samadi  abstractintroduction acute respiratory infection ari is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality all around the world the aim of this study was to determine the frequency mortality and association with clinical entities of influenza virus type a influenza virus type b respiratory syncytial virus rsv coronavirus and adenoviruses in patients with ari materials and methods during september 2014 till may 2015 143 respiratory inpatients samples for viral testing collected from central hospital in northwest of iran a real-time reverse transcription-pcr rt-pcr assay was done to allow in one test the detection of influenza a and  viruses also rsv and adenovirus were identified by immunochromatography test results twenty-four 46 cases were positive for influenza a which 11 46 of them were subtype h1n1 and 13 54 cases were subtype h3n2 also 21 40 cases were positive for influenza b 5 10 cases were positive for rsv and 2 4 cases were positive for adenovirus one of the patients was positive for both influenza a and adenovirus two of the patients were positive for both influenza a and rsv none of the patients were positive for coronavirus conclusions our findings show the importance of influenza virus type a influenza virus type b rsv and adenoviruses associated with ari in hospitalized patient and the different epidemiological patterns of the viruses in tabriz iran  acute respiratory infection ari caused by influenza virus type a subtypes h1n1 and h3n2 influenza virus type b respiratory syncytial virus rsv coronavirus and adenovirus are major causes of upper and lower respiratory tract diseases in infants and young children causing croup bronchiolitis and pneumonia 1  ari is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality all around the world however due to social nutritional and environmental factors the risk of death due to ari is 30 times higher in developing countries than in the northern hemisphere 2  while rarely causing death in industrialized countries aris cause enormous direct and indirect health care costs 3  in a relatively large proportion of samples obtained from persons suffering from ari no pathogens can be detected despite the use of a wide range of sensitive diagnostic assays even in the most comprehensive studies a causative agent either viral or nonviral can be identified in only 38-85 of the patients 4 5  according to the who reports causes about 4 million annual deaths of children under 2 years and about 20 to 40 percent of hospitalized children at the health centers are associated with acute respiratory infections 6 7  major outbreaks of influenza are always associated with influenza virus type a or b especially influenza type a virus which has been accounted for four worldwide pandemics during the twentieth century due to virus evolution and migration the transmission of respiratory viruses between animals and humans has been a very severe matter because influenza virus infection is a highly contagious respiratory disease that can spread easily by droplets or nasal secretions and is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality 8  it is estimated that influenza a viruses cause the death of approximately half a million individuals worldwide every year 9  it associated with illness among all age groups but the risk of serious illness and death following infection is highest among persons aged 65 years and persons with certain chronic medical conditions also rsv is known for its tendency to 1 the article is published in the original cause bronchiolitis in infancy but it can infect all agegroups causing illness indistinguishable from influenza 10  although rsv infection is the most important viral cause of severe acute lower respiratory tract infection only a small proportion of children infected with this virus develop severe disease increased understanding of the virus and the host response to it has resulted in expanded therapeutic and preventive options adenoviruses also produce a variety of serious diseases in people of all ages the mode of transmission of adenovirus infections includes respiratory fomite droplet venereal and faecal-oral routes they have been shown to spread with ease in aids patients in young children and in hospitalized patients a constant rate of about 8 of world-wide reported virus infections were observed to be due to adenovirus infections 11  in the case of coronavirus many isolates have been reported to cause upper respiratory tract infections in both children and adults 12  coronaviruses cause wheezing in young asthmatic children but only rarely cause wheezing in normal children determining etiological diagnoses for patients admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms remains a clinical and laboratory challenge infections with respiratory viral infections are traditionally diagnosed using viral culture rapid antigen test and direct immunofluorescence dif tests 13  however over the last 2 decades nucleic acid amplification techniques particularly real-time pcr have become available as diagnostic tools due to its high sensitivity and rapid turnaround time 14  aim of the present study was to determine the frequency and mortality of the viral respiratory infections including influenza virus type a influenza virus type b respiratory syncytial virus rsv coronavirus and adenoviruses in patients with ari that referred to central hospital in northwest of iran during september 2014 till may 2015 from september 2014 till may 2015 143 respiratory specimens for viral testing were collected from central hospital in tabriz northwest of iran the specimens included nasal washes in saline nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs in viral transport medium bronchoalveolar lavage throat or oropharyngeal swabs tracheal aspirates or sputum patients selection was consecutive and samples were included two respiratory samples collected in special sample collection tubes all patients had acute onset of respiratory symptoms accompanied by fever and a recent travel history to countries with sustained human-to-human transmission of rsv coronavirus adenovirus influenza virus type a and b and were analyzed with further assay after obtaining written informed consent from the parents we collected demographic data information on the nature and course of illness medication complications duration of stay parental absenteeism and follow-up information information was supplemented by review of medical records and structured telephone interviews data collected from the hospital database included the number of referrals to the central hospital in northwest of iran the number of acute admissions and the discharge diagnoses for referrals and admissions real-time rt-pcr was done based on who protocol 6  viral rna was extract from clinical specimen with qiaamp viral rna mini kit qiagen hilden germany according to manufacturers instructions for each test sample and positive and negative controls real-time ready rna virus master kit roche germany was prepared after adding 5 l viral rna to the above mix one-step real-time rt-pcr was performed according to the following conditions the reverse transcription for 8 minutes at 50c followed by 30 s at 95c 45 cycles of 95c for 1 s 56c for 20 s 72c for 1 s then 1 cycle of 40c for 30 s using the rotor-gene 3000 corbett research sydney australia and were analyzed by using a software roter-gene version 61 corbett australia the primers and probes were used as described in who protocol 6  rsv and adenovirus were identified by coris-bio concept immonochromatography diagnosis test coris bioconcept gembloux belgium for detection in swabs and nasopharyngeal secretions every sample was diluted in test buffer and strips were added and final results were compared with positive controls rsv and respiratory adenovirus positive controls were provided by coris-bioconcept also sample of suspected patients for coronavirus were sent to center of infection control for identifying by allele specific rt-pcr method ministry of health tehran iran data were analyzed by the  2 test or fishers exact test spss version 21 was used for statistical analysis from 143 patients that referred to central hospital in northwest of iran during the 9-month period 69 48 cases obtained from females and 74 52 cases obtained from males patients were investigated when clinical signs for viral infection were positive including radiographic signs fever and etc among suspected patients 91 64 samples were negative for all viruses that we have studied and 52 36 samples were posi-tive at least for one virus the distribution of samples according to sex and the presence of viral agents have shown in table fifty 35 cases of suspected patient were older than sixty 91 64 cases were between 10 to 60 and 2 1 cases were younger than 10 years old in positive cases sixteen 31 of cases were older than sixty 34 66 cases were between 10 to 60 and 2 3 cases were younger than 10 years old also 14 10 cases of suspected patients were died which 6 cases of them belonged to negative result for viruses while 9 64 cases of dead ones were older than sixty years old and rest of them were between 10 to 60 years old three 6 cases of positive results were positive for 2 viruses that the first one were positive for both h1n1 and adenoviruses the second one were positive for both h3n2 and adenoviruses and the third one were positive for both h3n2 and rsv among 3 cases that were positive for both viruses one of them was died among the positive results 2 1 cases were younger than 10 years old that both of whom were male and were positive for rsv sixty six 46 cases of suspected patient were lived in tabriz and 76 53 cases were lived in countryside and 1 case was lived in turkey from six suspicious patients to coronavirus no one was positive also there was no significant relationship between the presence of viral agents and positive bacterial culture p  005 the study showed that among the all cases of respiratory infection 46 cases were positive for influenza a that 46 of them were subtype h1n1 and 54 cases were subtype h3n2 also 40 of cases were positive for influenza b in the case of rsv and adenovirus 13 and 6 of cases were positive respectively in spite of other viruses no positive results were observed for coronavirus these reveal the importance of above mentioned viruses which associated with ari in hospitalized patient and the different epidemiological patterns in tabriz iran a study that carried out in kerman province revealed that from 168 specimens 18 cases 107 were infected with adenovirus and 63 cases 375 with rsv 7  this rate is slightly higher than the result obtained in this study that may be because their study was conducted on children under 2 years in another study that conducted in a tehran hospital on children with acute respiratory infection influenza a virus rsv and adenovirus were detected in 44 57 and 63 respectively 15  in the detection of seasonal influenza a viruses using rt-pcr assay during 2009 flu pandemic in golestan province showed 13 849 were infected with seasonal influenza h1n1 and 251633 with seasonal h3n2 influenza 16  in their study the rate of infection with seasonal h1n1 and h3n2 was similar to other studies reported from iran but lower than the rate reported from other parts of the world a survey that conducted during influenza a h1n1 pandemic in 2009 showed of 3672 confirmed cases 140 38 deaths were occurred 17  however the mortality rate in our study of 52 suspected patients among all viruses was 8 152 acute respiratory tract infections are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in humans and animals and the costs attributable to acute respiratory tract illnesses in humans are an important burden on national health care budgets 4  the morbidity and mortality from influenza and rsv vary from year to year from community to community and from institution to institution and an accurate estimate of disease burden requires temporal geographic and institutional breadth 18  according to who latest data on h1n1 influenza at least 13554 deaths related to 2009 h1n1 pandemic have been reported and nearly 883 of them were reported from who regional office for the eastern mediterranean emro 19  in studies of respiratory virus detection among children hospitalized with respiratory illness from different parts of the world rsv and influenza are frequently associated with a substantial proportion of hospitalizations 20  although human adenovirus infections are less common in adults than other respiratory virus infections such as influenza viruses human rhinoviruses human parainfluenza viruses enteroviruses and human coronaviruses they can cause fatal respiratory tract infections in affected patients 21  influenza occurs all over the world with an annual global attack rate estimated at 5-10 in adults and 20-30 in children in temperate regions influenza is a seasonal disease occurring typically in winter months it affects the northern hemisphere from november to april with a peak in february and the southern hemisphere from april to september a cor- relation between influenza activity and climate has previously been suggested for other countries 22  vaccination remains important as a means of reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by influenza viruses the h1n1 influenza virus which caused the 2009 pandemic continues to circulate in some parts of the world causing variable levels of disease and outbreaks in some countries seasonal trivalent vaccines are available that cover the h1n1 2009 virus in other countries however seasonal influenza vaccines are not available who advises that there is still public health value in using monovalent h1n1 vaccine where available to immunize persons at risk of severe disease from h1n1 influenza infection especially where trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine is not available however for individuals who cannot be or have not been vaccinated or when vaccine is not available antiviral agents can provide an important alternative groups at increased risk of severe illness from the pandemic h1n1 virus included young children pregnant women and people with underlying respiratory or other chronic conditions including asthma and diabetes patients who have severe or deteriorating influenza should be treated as soon as possible with oseltamivir patients who are at higher risk of severe or complicated influenza should be treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir as soon as possible travelers like local residents are at risk during the influenza season in addition groups of travelers eg on cruise ships that include individuals from areas affected by seasonal influenza may experience out-ofseason outbreaks travelers visiting countries in the opposite hemisphere during the influenza season are at special risk particularly if they do not have some degree of immunity through recent infection or regular vaccinations in this study almost half of the patients were living in small towns or rural areas with different climatic conditions and different prevalence of viral diseases these patients are often referred for treatment to central hospital in northwest of iran and may have a role in the transmission of the disease to new areas given the non-specific symptoms of these viruses and the high prevalence of viral diarrhea in our region more laboratories should be equipped for virus detection and vaccination might be considered as a prevention strategy to detection of influenza viruses pcr method widely used which its materials and equipments is available in many countries however the rate of mutation in the ha and na genes of the influenza virus is high therefore to determine the subtypes we used to specific primers that suggested by cdc also real-time pcr considerably increases the diagnostic yields for respiratory viruses from patients admitted with respiratory symptoms within a clinically relevant time frame this allows clinicians to initiate optimal patient management and to initiate adequate future use of antiviral therapy and optimal infection control 23  therefore we can conclude that a in spite of general conception the viruses that investi-gated in our study have shown endemic distribution among the study period because of spreading rumors about ebola disease outbreaks on social networking a wave of fear in people who had similar and even mild symptoms were created however lastly it considered as an epidemic of influenza or possible coronavirus b our results indicated that rapid test method which was used in the present study showed less positive results in compare with rt-pcr method c in the case of influenza b we had the same mortality or more than influenza a which possibly is in contrary with others d finally we should conclude that we need to develop local protocols and strategies in the case of viral infections and how we have to act when we face with micro-epidemics and endemics to prevent more distribute of the infection  impact of avian viruses michael perdue l bruce seal s christon hurst j   in considering the ecology of the avian viruses and their impact on life on earth it may be useful to first consider the host itself the class aves first diverged from the reptiles between 150 and 300 million years ago depending on which current paleontological interpretations one accepts of the vertebrate classes they are most often compared with the reptiles from which they evolved and with mammals because of their common warm-blooded nature this shared feature with mammals is probably the most influential with respect to ecology since a virus adapted to warm-blooded physiology would not fare well in the cold-blooded world and vice versa along these lines our recent experience is that some virologists think that a bird is a bird and that if a given virus replicates in one it will replicate in them all this is of course far from the truth and perhaps should be a starting point for discussing avian virus ecology according to fossil records the class aves emerged from the extinctions of the late cretaceous period 65000000 years ago somewhat bottlenecked as did the class mammalia but since that time they have undergone parallel evolution with mammals and are equally diverse in their own right certainly some viruses such as avian paramyxovirus 1 of which newcastle disease virus is the prototype are infectious for numerous orders of birds there are also other important avian virus strains such as the gallid herpesvirus 1 infectious laryngotracheitis and the avihepadnaviridae which appear to be exclusively confined to a single bird family or even genus it is clear that birds because of their close association with powered flight do present a more homogeneous anatomy and physiology than do the class mammalia feduccia 1996 whether this affects or specifies the molecular nature of viruses that infect birds is not really known this feature however almost certainly uniquely impacts the natural distribution and ecology of the viruses that inhabit the flying birds a virus infecting or persisting in an arctic tern could potentially be translocated up to 12000 miles in a few weeks viruses such as some avian orthomyxovirus or avian paramyxovirus strains which may exhibit subclinical infections might be shared among a migrating flock of waterfowl and persist for indefinite periods as the flocks move from lake to lake along the way the virus might be shared with other birds crossing flight paths so birds do present unique environments for transmission of viruses the commercial practices of humans have further provided unique opportunities for transmission not normally seen for birds the order galliformes in particular which includes domestic and wild fowl pheasants quail and turkeys has been unquestionably affected it would be quite safe to say that humans have both determined and upset the ecological balance among members of this order and the viruses that affect them due to continuous breeding practices live-virus vaccination regimes and by housing tens of thousands of birds in a single enclosure situations never encountered in natural settings are created whether this has affected the virus-host ecological balance in other orders of undomesticated birds as well is not known but it would seem highly likely one of the most important features of a host-parasite relationship of course is the hosts immune defense while there are similarities shared with respect to the immune system particularly the dual humoral and cell-mediated nature there are marked differences between cold- and warm-blooded vertebrates and additional significant differences between birds and mammals eerola et al 1987 the discovery of processing and maturation of immunoglobulin-producing lymphocytes was made as a result of characterization of an avian-specific organ the bursa of fabricius ratcliffe 1989 although functional equivalents exist in mammals the bursa is a distinct and wholly avian-specific organ since several viruses are known to affect this organ specifically it should be considered a unique ecological niche a second significant difference in the immune system of birds is in the apparent genetic content responsible for specifying the avian major histocompatibility complex mhc the chicken mhc appears considerably more simple providing the oxymoron a simpler complex than the mammalian mhc kaufman and wallny 1996 several alleles have arisen and considerable recombination documented in the mammalian mhcs that thus far have been studied these are responsible for producing a great variety of class i- ii- and iii-type proteins used in recognition and presentation of antigen in the chicken some mhc haplotypes produce only one type of class i protein and there is no evidence for recombination at all kaufman and wallny 1996 this has led to speculation that the relationship with the avian pathogens has evolved significantly differently from the mammals one result of this difference may be the occurrence and frequency of either resistance or sensitivity to specific viral infections encountered in chickens see below thus the class aves presents several unique features that might ultimately affect the ecology of viruses that infect them the classification of birds has presented a significant challenge to systematists the number of species has actually decreased over the years because of the clearer genetic relationships that have emerged conversely additional species have been defined as recognition of convergent evolution has become clearer currently new species are identified at a rate of about two per year while there remains some disagreement among specialists most accept the current classification of 30 orders 174 families 2044 genera and 9020 species gill 1990 molecular analysis of avian genes for phylogenetic studies is still in its early stages restriction fragment length polymorphism rflp analysis and sequence analysis of 12s mitochondria dna has yielded some molecular phylogenetic information but not enough to gain any insight regarding the viruses of birds hedges et al 1996 cooper and penny 1997 mindell et al 1997 roughly speaking the flightless orders represented by ostriches rheas cassowaries and kiwis are thought to be the most ancient while the bewildering array of members of the order passeriformes representing 60 of known species and 40 of known families are thought to be the most recent gill 1990 trying to determine how long viruses have been associated with various avian groups is of course as impossible as it is with virushost relationships in any other classes orthomyxoviruses paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses have recently been isolated from ostriches rheas and emus indicating no absolute barriers in these more ancient birds the class aves is of course distributed worldwide in addition there are several hundred species that migrate sometimes in spectacular fashion biogeographers have divided the earth into six distinct faunal regions which correspond somewhat with the major continental areas welty 1982 these include the nearctic north america and greenland palearctic asia europe and north africa ethiopian central and southern africa oriental india southeast asia australasian australia new guinea and neotropical south and central america each area contains its own characteristic birds in the northern hemisphere nearctic and palearctic most species are migratory which is not the case in the other areas the neotropical has the richest and most abundant bird life and the southern hemisphere has by far the most families represented as well as the most families peculiar to a given region each year billions of land birds and waterfowl in north america and asia head south to south america and africa respectively carrying their viruses with them the size and scale of these geographic relocations are unmatched by any other land vertebrates the sea mammals are the only other comparable migrating vertebrates and they surely cross paths with the birds in the most interesting putative contacts purely avian-origin type a orthomyxovirus of at least two different subtypes were isolated from dead and dying seals off the coast of new england in 1980 and 19821983 webster et al 1981b hinshaw et al 1984 this represents viral ecology at its most forceful being effected between two warm-blooded vertebrate orders during their natural migration and geographic interaction if one takes a broad look at the virus families associated with avian hosts table i
 it is actually easier to list the families of viruses that infect vertebrates but that do not yet have a clear avian member these are the iridoviridae arenoviridae african swine fever-like viruses and filoviridae a similar comparison of families that do not contain a mammalian member yields only the birnaviridae so in one sense the mammalian host might be considered more virus-friendly rather than the alternative still many investigators think of bird tissues in particular the embryo as being an ideal medium for identifying new viruses if just from an experimental and practical rather than a natural point of view the avian host has played a tremendous role in our understanding of viral ecology many of the most important findings in virology have been made utilizing the chicken embryo and in chicken cell cultures the egg also continues to provide an abundant and important substrate for the production of veterinary and human vaccines if we think of ecology as the study of organisms and their relationship with their environment to include all other organisms we most certainly encounter a unique relationship with viruses unlike higher pathogens viruses really do not mate communicate or colonize except in the very broadest stretches of the imagination they simply parasitize and replicate we try and make them more familiar by defining higher organism-type genetic alterations as evolution when in truth the viruses may simply be adapting to the evolutionary pressures encountered by or within its host obviously the host is central to the viruses lifestyle and must be considered a major part of virus ecology in this sense information gathered on various viruses as they replicate in embryos or embryo cells in the absence of immune pressure should only be considered natural for those viruses that are transmitted vertically the embryo or cell culture then can only provide a window on the natural ecology of the organism in which the immune system is not a factor in ecological terms only the natural state of the virushost relationship becomes important viruses being parasites these relationships more often than not eventually result in a disease state it is not possible to distinguish the molecular biology of avian viruses from that of non-avian viruses on the basis of features unique to the avian system however
there are some important distinctions with which viruses must deal one dramatic difference between birds and mammals is body temperature on average birds operate at 34c higher than mammals and most can readily regulate their temperature some dropping body temperature as much as 10c during the night gill 1990 while this certainly could influence such things as rates of viral enzyme activity polymerase fidelity or protein stability there are no situations documented in which a particular virus group is restricted to class aves solely on the basis of body temperature it is possible to distinguish some important receptor-specific distinctions unique to avian systems one example is found in the influenza type a viruses the glycosidic linkages associated with sialic acid residues on the avian versus mammalian cell surface serves to restrict the strains of viruses able to replicate influenza virus hemagglutinin ha proteins bind to sialic acid residues on the surface of the host cell although there is no absolute barrier those viruses that replicate well in avian cells have a receptor binding pocket on the surface of the ha that has a preference for the -23 siallylsugar linkages abundant in bird tissues those viruses that replicate well in mammalian cells have a preference for -26 linkages more prevalent in mammalian cells rogers and paulson 1983 murphy and webster 1996 there are probably many more receptor specificities associated with other avian virus infections particularly among the herpesviruses where host range is narrowly dictated another example of virus-specified tissue tropism unique to birds would be infectious bursal disease virus ibdv genus avibirnavirus which has evolved an affinity for the bursa a bird-specific organ the other two known genera of birnaviridae infect fish and invertebrates since there are as yet no mammalian members it is tempting to speculate that ibdv is bird specific because of its evolved affinity for the bursa air sacs are also uniquely avian structures the bird lung is a fixed tissue incapable of expansion like mammalian lungs the air sacs are a series of extensions of the respiratory system that expand with the musculature of the body cavity and allow the large-scale rapid oxygen transfer needed for powered flight the air sac system is extensive throughout the bird even encroaching into bone tissue some birds have as many as nine distinct air sacs many viruses replicate and cause disease in this unique organ system and there are examples of apparent preferences by some viruses for air sac tissue over other respiratory tissue finally feathers the most notable and prominent distinguishing feature of the class aves provide a unique niche for at least two three viruses  avipox mareks disease and psittacine beak-and-feather disease virus  which can replicate in and are spread from feather follicles biggs 1985 tripathy and reed 1997 as mentioned previously the immune system of the intact bird is a critical feature in the establishment of ecological relationships between many viruses and hosts as the immune system plays a major role in the relationships they will be covered but there are some extraordinary examples that deserve their own mention mareks disease caused by an alphaherpesvirus is most commonly associated with lymphomas developing relatively early in the life of a chicken the initial infection in md is a respiratory infection probably initiated in macrophages a typical field infection would then progress through the following phases in a bird initial lytic infection  latency  2nd lytic infection  oncogenesis latency is established primarily in lymphoid cells and mostly in activated t lymphocytes in susceptible birds the latent state progresses to a second round of lytic infections at multiple sites in the bird interestingly at this point the feather follicle epithelium is the only site where complete virus replication occurs and becomes a significant source of environmental infectious virus calnek and witter 1997 concomitant and permanent immunosuppression occurs in the affected bird the disease then progresses into a lymphoproliferative phase in susceptible birds that can range in severity depending on the virus strain and breed of chickens some breeds have shown natural resistance to this progression and although the mechanism of resistance is not completely understood it involves primarily lymphoid tissue and is dictated mostly by genes involved in the immune response venugopal and payne 1995 it should be clear from this scenario that the immune system in this hostparasite relationship plays a critical role in the ecology of mareks disease virus infectious bursal disease virus as mentioned earlier is a virus that replicates exclusively in lymphoid tissue the virus can be detected replicating in the bursa of fabricius and within circulating lymphocytes as early as 4 hours after infection of a chicken it causes acute degeneration of various lymphoid tissues within the first day of infection and results in a severe albeit age-dependent depression in the humoral immune response being most dramatic in very young birds interestingly the infection does not suppress b-cell responses to the viral antigens themselves in fact there is stimulation of proliferation of b cells committed to anti-ibdv antibody production mcferran 1993 one may only speculate as to what role if any this may play in the viral ecology or replicative cycle but the immune system is once again a major participant in this hostparasite relationship 
finally the effects of vaccination programs on the ecology of avian viruses cannot be overemphasized in one sense we have an ongoing experiment where humans control the type of viruses to which certain species of birds are exposed since live viruses generally yield much better immune responses they are employed most often in the case of the single-stranded rna viruses noted for their ability to rapidly mutate and avoid the immune system this has the effect of artificially challenging the immune system creating selection pressure between host and parasite that would not normally occur this may be effective in the short run protecting against disease but the long-term effects are unknown summarized in table i are some of the most important features of relationships of various viruses with their avian hosts as well as the wide variety of relationships that exist it is not feasible to list all the interesting attributes for each virus-host relationship but the table presents a variety of relationships that will be covered in more detail in the following sections as such the table should not be taken as the final word on each member virus for example in the case of turkey meningoencephalitis virus a flavivirus reduced egg production is listed under pathogenesis reduction in egg production is a common feature in many virus infections of poultry and while listing it under pathogenesis somewhat stretches the meaning of that word this clinical sign is one of the most important aspects of that disease in turkeys although there is variation in the economic or ecological impact of various viral groups from year to year and among geographic sites the top ten list of virus groups exhibiting routine significant impact on commercial poultry worldwide not necessarily in order of impact are paramyxoviruses newcastle disease coronaviruses infectious bronchitis herpesviruses infectious laryngotracheitis mareks disease duck enteritis reoviruses viral arthritis picornaviruses avian encephalomyelitis adenoviruses egg drop syndrome retroviruses lymphoid leukosis orthomyxoviruses avian influenza poxviruses fowlpox and birnaviruses infectious bursal disease the circoviruses chick anemia could likely be included in the above list except it is not yet known to what extent the viral infection alone influences morbidity and mortality see below what may not be obvious from table i is that if one searches for viruses in a given avian species one will likely find them in some of the virus families listed investigators were forced to clearly separate the disease-causing virus in question from accompanying contaminant viruses which may or may not have influenced the original disease manifestation there appear to be many viruses of birds that in certain ecological conditions and in certain species may be considered normal flora and are not associated with disease these obviously are less interesting to any funding agencies and consequently do not receive much research attention no one really knows to what extent their transmission and persistence in avian populations affect their own ecology or that of their hosts the office international des epizooties oie the principal world organization for animal health provides listings of the most serious infectious diseases of animals oie 1996 and divides them into two groups list a diseases which includes those diseases that spread rapidly the scope of which extends beyond national borders and have particularly serious socioeconomic or public health consequences and list b diseases which include those that are considered to be of socioeconomic andor public health importance within countries of the avian viral diseases listed above only highly pathogenic avian influenza and velogenic newcastle disease are in list a mareks disease infectious bursal disease infectious bronchitis duck enteritis and infectious laryngotracheitis are in list b the only avian disease in oies list and not on our top 10 list is duck hepatitis which is a complex of diseases caused by at least three virus families and generally limited to country-specific origins the ecological impact of viruses of birds ultimately interests us as homo sapiens perhaps only to the extent that we are affected in this respect there is no question that the major impact thus far has been on raising birds as a food source for our species ecologically speaking this impact could have very significant consequences when one considers that poultry provide the most widely used protein source in the world thus we will consider for the most part how viruses affect this food source the most significant and widespread infections of wild birds will be discussed as they are encountered relative to commercial and domestic birds the most imminent and significant human public health concerns with regard to bird viruses appear to be twofold1
the potential relationships with type a orthomyxoviruses that have become at least partially adapted in a totally nonpathogenic state to some avian orders there is compelling evidence that these viruses may also replicate in pigs and re-assort with pig andor human strains of influenza yielding new variants capable of replicating and causing disease in humans they also find their way into commercial poultry sometimes with devastating consequences with the recent documented transmission of a lethal avian influenza virus from commercial poultry to humans these ecological relationships take on new significance2
the presence of a large reservoir of arboviruses in wild birds some of which when transmitted by invertebrate vectors to mammals cause disease

 beyond these two examples other relationships are less directly important to human public health other avian-origin viruses are capable of replicating in and sometimes causing mild disease in humans but there is obviously not room in one chapter to cover each in detail infectious laryngotracheitis ilt is a respiratory disease almost exclusively of chickens infections in turkeys and pheasants have been reported but surveys have yielded no wild bird reservoir or other domestic poultry reservoir cranshaw and boycott 1982 based on this and the knowledge that ilt apparently exhibits little antigenic heterogeneity it has been proposed that through proper husbandry practices and appropriate vaccination techniques the disease could be eliminated from commercial poultry bagust and johnson 1998 the virus is a member of the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily and is identified taxonomically as gallid herpesvirus i the disease is almost exclusively respiratory with no systemic involvement the severity of disease can vary from significant mortality 70 in young birds to an inapparent infection of adult birds there are age-dependent effects on the pathognomonic signs and there do appear to be strain-specific virulence differences however different isolates do not exhibit sufficient genetic heterogeneity thus far to identify specific virulence factors bagust and guy 1997 the most interesting aspect of ilt is its capacity for persistence in infected birds and flocks showing no disease signs this persistence is most likely due to establishment of the latent state and recrudescence numerous studies have demonstrated re-isolation of virus many months after initial infection and one more recent study demonstrated reactivation of latent virus due to stress factors hughes et al 1989 this latency achieved by herpesviruses could certainly be considered a unique ecological state and most herpesvirus infections in birds are associated with its establishment duck plague also known as duck viral enteritis dve is caused by an alphaherpesvirus classified as anatid herpesvirus-1 which infects free-living and domestic ducks geese and swans sandhu and leibovitz 1997 the disease is acute and often associated with high morbidity and mortality the virus has a worldwide distribution and has caused numerous documented outbreaks in free-living anatids the first documented north american outbreak was in commercial ducks on long island new york in 1967 leibovitz and hwang 1968 and since that time sporadic reappearance of the virus in commercial and wild populations has occurred major outbreaks in free-living birds along the mississippi flyway and a large epornitic in south dakota in 1973 killed tens of thousands of wild ducks and geese brand 1987 vertical transmission and recrudescence of latent virus has been established experimentally in mallard ducks but has not been demonstrated in wild waterfowl species susceptibility may vary among various waterfowl although more than 30 species have been shown to be naturally or experimentally infected and virulence differences among dve strains have been demonstrated the other notable avian herpesvirus infection occurs in pigeons the virus is taxonomically designated as columbid herpesvirus i and is antigenically indistinguishable from natural isolates taken from wild falcons and owls vindevogel and duchatel 1997 the causative virus is antigenically distinct from ilt mdv herpesvirus of turkeys hvt and the anatid herpesvirus i the disease associated with infection by columbid herpesvirus i is a major cause of growth retardation and bad performance in homing pigeons though mortality is generally low this virus like ilt becomes latent reappears and is shed in asymptomatic birds and flocks other antigenically distinct herpesviruses have also been isolated from cormorants quail and storks kaleta 1990 has proposed the division of these various herpes viruses into eight antigenic groups the host specificity for each group varies but in general they appear to be strictly adapted to the host of origin as exemplified by the gallid herpesvirus i gallid herpesvirus ii and hvt will be discussed in the following section the impact of transmissible neoplastic diseases of poultry has been quite variable over the years prior to vaccination losses to mareks disease were often devastating and even in marketable flocks condemnations due to lymphomas at processing plants could reach 2 lymphomas caused by mdv and retroviruses are still the most common viral neoplastic diseases of poultry and a recent increase in mortality and evolution of more virulent mdv strains indicates that the impact of these viruses will continue to be felt witter 1996 mareks disease is caused by a herpesvirus that has two very similar relatives a second nononcogenic serotype and the herpesvirus of turkeys hvt these are sometimes classified as serotypes 13 respectively of the gallid herpesvirus ii strain they share common antigens that distinguish them from the nononcogenic herpesviruses but can be distinguished on the basis of antigenic differences calnek and witter 1997 only the oncogenic mdvs serotype 1 cause significant problems in commercial poultry the herpesvirus of turkeys is ubiquitous among commercial flocks and quite prevalent in wild turkeys but has not been directly associated with disease the serotype 2 strains were originally thought to be nononcogenic apathogenic mdv isolates until they were serologically distinguished from the original isolates the type 2 serotypes are associated with subclinical infections in chickens although not as prevalent as turkey strains the hvt isolate is a very interesting and important isolate as it was used and is still used in vaccine formulations against mareks disease in chicken flocks it has been very effective at protecting flocks against lymphomas and thus correctly billed as the first anticancer vaccine mareks disease is relatively well controlled by using mixtures of primarily serotype 2 and 3 isolates in vaccine formulations however this vaccination program may ultimately extract a price shown in figure 1
is a diagrammatic representation of the evolution of virulence in mdv strains associated with changing vaccine formulations the extent to which these formulations have influenced the evolution of virulence is not proven but certainly the association is undeniable the 1990s have brought an increase in incidence of mareks disease cases and the presence of these acutely virulent strains raises concerns for the future what is clear is the role of humans in the generation of these strains there is evidence that the commercial housing practices developed in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in generation of strains that were oncogenic and that this rapid evolution of virulence in the last 40 years is probably due to human control of commercial bird populations the avian retroviruses have one of the most interesting histories of all of the avian viruses the first transmissible lymphomas were demonstrated in 1908 by ellermann and bang 1908 and the first cell-free transmissible solid tumor by peyton rous three years later rous 1911 the etiologic agents of both of these diseases were later shown to be members of what is now known as the avian leukosis virus-avian sarcoma virus complex alvasv of related retroviruses scientists investigating this interesting group of viruses have garnered more nobel prizes six than with any other group because of their relative simplicity in genetic content and their close association with the genetic character of their host they have provided a bountiful model for the study of oncogenesis these are rna-containing viruses that replicate via an intermediate dna stage that is most often incorporated into the host genome the integrated viral genomes serve as templates for production of new progeny genomic rna molecules and the mrnas needed to make new viral proteins coffin 1996 in the process these viruses transform the host cell into a tumor cell there is a significant array of viral subtypes and relationships that exist between the host and avian retroviruses and numerous reviews that may be consulted crittenden 1981 swanstrom and vogt 1990 there are several viral subgroups based on antigenic differences alone in the surface envelope glycoproteins viral subtypes have also been grouped on the basis of whether the viruses rapidly induce neoplasia because of the presence of a viral oncogene or whether they induce slow development of tumors due to their integration into the host genome and subsequent activation of cellular oncogenes in commercial poultry the predominant problems are caused by the latter the slow-inducing lymphoid leukosis viruses llvs the sarcoma- myeloblastosis- and erythroblastosis-inducing strains cause only sporadic problems additionally it has been calculated that losses due to llv because of poultry performance decreases are actually greater than those due to the lymphomas still these viruses continue to cause condemnations at slaughter and must be distinguished from the more rapidly forming mdv-induced lymphomas two other oncogenic avian retroviruses pose significant problems and possess much wider host ranges than the llvsarcoma complex the relatively new subgroup j has been characterized in europe as causing significant myelocytoma and endothelioma in contrast to the llvs subgroup j viruses have a high tropism for cells of the myelomonocytic series but a very low tropism for bursal cells arshad et al 1997 a related subgroup j virus has been identified in broilerbreeder flocks in the united states as well smith et al 1997 additionally of note are those retroviruses of the reticuloendotheliosis virus rev group infection with members of this group only rarely results in disease and then disease most commonly occurs only in the hosts from which rev was first isolated turkeys still the rev group is predicted to have significant potential for causing problems in poultry witter and johnson 1985 and the wide host range of the virus group has prompted speculation regarding potential as a public health risk there are in fact data demonstrating antibodies to the virus in human and other mammalian sera johnson et al 1998 coronaviruses contain a large positive-sense rna genome of approximately 30 kb members of this virus family infect both mammals and birds cavanagh et al 1994 infectious bronchitis caused by a coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv is one of the major poultry viral diseases of worldwide economic importance it is also one of the most rapidly spreading avian respiratory diseases known mcmartin 1993 the virus is antigenically variable owing to a high mutation rate in the surface glycoprotein s gene new antigenic variants of ibv continue to be isolated from various geographic regions thus far it has not been possible to determine the number of distinct ibv subtypes but there are at least six siddell 1995 strains can differ in their virulence and tissue tropism but in general the disease is a rapid-onset respiratory distress that can cause significant mortality in young birds in established flocks the infection is often associated with growth retardation and reduction in egg production that may be exacerbated by other respiratory pathogens estimates of a 10 to 20 loss in market value have been made for a typical outbreak in a flock vaccination is employed to control the disease and an interesting related feature is the demonstration that vaccine strains can undergo recombination with wild-type strains consequently new ibv antigenic variants of the s1 gene emerge with characteristics of both viruses cavanagh et al 1992 wang et al 1993 ibv is also an excellent example of a virus exquisitely adapted to its host as it is not found naturally in any other reservoir chickens seem to be the only reservoir and the virus is capable of persisting in some manner within populations and later being transmitted to naive flocks evidence suggests the mode is primarily airborne transmission in controlled studies birds in houses 115 feet away from an experimentally seeded house were infected via aerosol transmission mcmartin 1993 and circumstantial data from natural outbreaks suggest transmission over distances of several hundred yards cumming 1970 coronaviral enteritis of turkeys also known as bluecomb disease may also be species specific since chickens pheasants and quail do not exhibit any disease following inoculation with a strain of virus that is virulent for turkeys hofstad et al 1970 larsen 1979 coronaviruses have been isolated from ratites with enteric disease in zoological collections but the relationship of these isolates with the turkey coronavirus tcv has not been investigated frank and carpenter 1992 kennedy and brenneman 1995 transmission of tcv appears to be restricted to the fecal-oral route although cell-free lysates of the bursa from infected birds can be used to transmit the agent orally among turkey flocks the primary mode of transmission of coronaviral enteritis is via contaminated personnel and equipment however since tcv is excreted in fecal material and is very stable it is conceivable that wild birds may serve as vectors for the agent morbidity is usually as high as 100 with mortality becoming as high as 50 in an infected turkey flock mortality among poults may be much higher with increased numbers of secondary bacterial gastrointestinal infections contributing to severity of disease turkey coronavirus also shares features reported for mammalian hemagglutinating coronaviruses and is closely related by sequence and antigenic crossreactivity to bovine coronavirus and a human coronavirus isolate verbeek and tijssen 1991 this close relationship suggests recent interspecies transmission of the coronaviruses while no etiologic agent has been pinpointed a bovine origin coronavirus has been implicated in an emerging enteric disease of turkeys called poult enteritis mortality syndrome pems barnes and guy 1997 the arthropod-borne viruses arboviruses present a unique challenge to evaluating ecological virushost relationships this grouping includes members from several virus families six of which have members isolated from birds togaviridae flaviviridae reoviridae arenoviridae bunyaviridae and rhabdoviridae of these only the togaviridae and flaviviridae have strains that have caused documented disease in commercial poultry and game birds although difficult to assess in feral populations isolates from the remaining virus families as well as several isolates from the togaviridae and flaviviridae are not associated with any pathology in birds of the togaviridae the genus alphavirus contains the encephalitic strains causing eastern equine encephalitis eee western equine encephalitis wee and a closely related wild bird isolate  the highlands j virus hjv pheasants have been the primary targets of significant outbreaks of eee signs of infection are primarily but not exclusively neural and mortality rates have reached 80 in some natural outbreaks ficken et al 1993 eleazer and hill 1994 economically significant outbreaks of disease due to eee virus in turkeys have occurred in wisconsin with severity of the disease decreasing with increasing bird age significant outbreaks have also been recorded in chukar partridges ducks and chickens wee has been only rarely associated with disease in avian species and the closely related hj virus appears to be the eastern united states equivalent to wee hjv has caused severe neuropathogenic outbreaks in chukar partridges and has been associated with infections in turkey flocks resulting in acute reduction in egg production wages et al 1993 of course these encephalitic viruses also cause disease in humans and horses another interesting alphavirus ockelbo virus related to sindbis virus has been implicated in causing arthralgia and rash in humans following its isolation from mosquitos collected during the outbreak these viruses are transmitted by mosquitos among bird populations which may act as the vector for transmission between humans and avian species ockelbo virus therefore is apparently maintained in an enzootic cycle involving birds and mosquitos with transmission to other hosts such as humans antibodies to ockelbo virus either experimentally or naturally infected have been detected in passeriformes galliformes and anseriformes lundstrom et al 1992 lundstrom and niklasson 1996 viremia in the absence of disease resulting from infection with ockelbo has also been demonstrated in these bird groups given the widespread occurrence of antibodies to these encephalitic alphaviruses it seems logical to conclude that birds in many cases act as natural and reservoir hosts 
the only flavivirus thus far associated with disease in birds is the israel turkey meningoencephalitis virus infected birds exhibit neurological dysfunction and occasional significant mortality this virus has also been identified in turkeys in south africa double-stranded segmented rna viruses are unique and intriguing the distinguished virologist dr wolfgang k joklik when asked what in the world he thought they meant in the grand scheme of biology replied and i paraphrase they represent an evolutionary step forward in the establishment of the ideal genetic material the reoviruses have fascinated virologists for some time they have an unusual and complex replication strategy are able to undergo reassortment of their genes and are curious in that they retain their infecting subviral cores as their rna replication template reoviruses are also quite stable outside the host remaining viable for up to a year at room temperature nibert et al 1996 the mammalian strains have a wide host range but are found without any associated clinical signs the origin of the name reo respiratory and enteric orphan telling most of the story in poultry several antigenic subtypes have been identified and the virus can be classified based on serotyping and virulence but there is no unified typing scheme as yet kawamura and tsubahara 1960 robertson and wilcox 1986 the most severe and common pathology associated with reoviruses is arthritistenosynovitis although associations with other clinical syndromes including respiratory and enteric disorders have been described rosenberger and olson 1997 often the clinical states are influenced by the presence of other pathogens arthritis is a significant problem in birds but primarily only in young chicks and turkey poults other reoviridae in birds include several members of the genera orbivirus arboviruses see below and rotavirus which have been associated with a runtingstunting syndrome in chickens the birnaviridae are a relatively recently characterized family of viruses that contain two double-stranded segments of rna and have no mammalian members thus far ictv 1995 they were difficult to classify for many years because of their cell-associated nature and slow replication in cell culture systems currently two serotypes 1 and 2 are accepted with significant antigenic variation and numerous proposed subtypes within each serotype mcferran et al 1980 jackwood and saif 1987 chickens are the only animals known to develop disease and lesions when naturally infected by avibirnaviruses both serotypes are distributed worldwide but serotype 1 strains are the only ones associated with pathogenicity and immunosuppression the bursa is the primary target organ and strains of differing virulence have been identified the disease is most significantly manifested when young birds are infected and permanent immunosuppression results this sets the stage for subsequent severe viral and bacterial infections later in life interestingly ibd is an example where maternal antibodies derived by either vaccinations or natural infections provide significant immune protection highly virulent strains of these viruses exist in various countries worldwide and there are indications that new virulent variants do arise in the face of immune pressure chettle et al 1989b avian adenoviruses are double-stranded dna viruses containing 3010 genes these viruses can be loosely divided into three groups based on antigenic relationships of internal proteins mcferran 1997 although the three groups have not been officially recognized by the ictv the avian group i adenoviruses include at least 12 serologically distinct types all of which have been isolated from mildly or asymptomatic poultry the type species is known as the celo chick embryo lethal orphan or phelps strain or f1 fowl strain there are also numerous isolates from other avian species plus electron microscopy and immunological evidence that the type i aviadenoviruses are widely distributed in birds by themselves these viruses present no particular clinical problems in commercial poultry but they are thought to cause significant problems in mixed infections with immunosuppressive viruses such as ibdv and chick infectious anemia virus ciav a virus virtually indistinguishable from the celo strain known as quail bronchitis virus qbv can be devastating in commercial quail operations causing as high as 80 mortality dubose and grumbles 1959 montreal 1992 virus isolations and significant antibody levels in wild quail suggest that the virus may present disease problems in nature king et al 1981 although there are no documented cases or epizootics the group ii aviadenoviruses include turkey hemorrhagic enteritis virus hev pheasant marble spleen disease virus msdv and the avian adenovirus splenomegaly aas of chickens these three agents are serologically indistinguishable but induce differing clinical manifestations in the different species infections caused by this virus group appear to target lymphoid tissue often resulting in immunosuppression and there are strain-specific differences in virulence among the various group ii isolates pierson and domermuth 1997 hev reached epidemic proportions in the 1960s and still causes significant problems in turkey-producing states in the united states and elsewhere msdv is a significant pathogen in confinement pheasant operations causing significant economic losses aas is virtually ubiquitous among chicken flocks in the united states in which case mild respiratory signs and splenomegaly are occasionally associated the syndrome is similar to the disease state observed in pheasants but in general aas virus causes no significant problems among chickens evidence indicates that these group ii avian adenoviruses are limited to the order galliformes and that wild bird populations even wild turkeys are unaffected the more interesting group iii adenoviruses first appeared in 1976 associated with a distinct clinical manifestation called egg drop syndrome eds in which egg production decreases and thin-shelled or shell-less eggs are produced the disease has caused significant egg production losses mostly in the eurasian and australian-pacific poultry markets a virus named eds76 which has been found associated with this syndrome may have been originally introduced via a contaminated vaccine but it seems clear now that sporadic cases are initiated by introduction of the causative virus from domestic and wild waterfowl mostly ducks and geese when endemic in flocks the virus is transmitted vertically and exhibits a latent phase which is reactivated in laying hens usually after egg production begins the virus initially appears to replicate in lymphoid tissues but rapidly moves to the oviduct where replication causes inflammation and production of aberrant eggs unlike other avian adenoviruses the group iii strains do not replicate in the intestinal mucosa it is likely that eds76 virus or very similar strains are present ubiquitously in wild ducks and geese but rarely appear to be associated with disease mcferran 1997 the avipoxviruses are widely distributed throughout the class aves having been isolated from some 60 species representing 20 avian taxonomic families the avipoxviruses are responsible for economically important disease problems in commercial poultry and aviaries tripathy 1993 they may cause a slowly developing cutaneous disease with low mortality or conversely significant mortality and generalized infections when in the diphtheritic form on mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract and associated areas these large dna viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of the cell where they form characteristic inclusion bodies within rapidly proliferating nodular lesions the poxviruses may be transmitted by mechanical means such as introduction from poultry workers into abrasions in the skin of uninfected poultry there is also real evidence for transmission of the disease by mosquitos and other vectors such as mites in close conditions where the number of diseased birds is high the avipoxviruses can also apparently establish a latent state and be naturally or chemically induced to reactivate kirmse 1967b cutaneous lesions containing infectious virus persistent for more than a year have also been documented in wild birds kirmse 1967a variant strains of avipoxviruses have since been isolated from previously vaccinated flocks that were experiencing significant mortality from the diphtheritic form of the disease tripathy and reed 1997 this suggests that similar to mareks disease vaccination against poxviruses may ultimately lead to escape of more virulent forms of the viruses the avipoxviruses are also considered one of the most promising dna virus vectors for delivery of recombinant poultry vaccines and poxvirus-vectored vaccines against newcastle disease and avian influenza have been licensed avian encephalomyelitis is primarily a disease of young chicks caused by a picornavirus the disease was quite economically important prior to initiation of live-virus vaccination the host range is very limited order galliformes and there is only one virus serotype the natural isolate is enterotropic and is transmitted horizontally orally and vertically there is a gradient of pathology dependent on the age of infection of young chicks pre-immune chicks from non-immune parents will generally die if infected within 1 to 2 days of hatch if infected between 2 and 8 days of age they may live but exhibit significant nervous involvement encephalomyelitis if infected beyond that age they may exhibit enteric pathology but not neural signs at adulthood or full immunocompetence they may be infected but refractory to any clinical signs so the immune status of the host in this case is very important in affecting the course of the viral replication calnek 1997 another avian picornavirus distinct from aev is the avian nephritis virus shirai et al 1991 this virus is similar to aev in that it is primarily a problem in very young birds and has a very limited host range as the name implies a distinct clinical syndrome is associated with the agents but it is has not yet been determined how extensive infections are in commercial poultry finally another picornavirus duck hepatitis 1 dhv-1 has caused significant problems in commercial duck operations there are still unknowns with regard to the overall importance of dhv-1 and there are additional virus-induced types of hepatitis disease with at least two others often encountered the most significant cost involved in raising birds for food sources is feeding them consequently diseases that affect the feed-protein conversion ratio will directly affect the cost of marketable birds as such enteric disease even when nonlethal or mild in nature can affect the performance of food-source birds in recent years investigators have identified rotaviruses in chickens astroviruses in turkeys and enterovirus-like particles in several avian species associated with enteric diseases many of these have been associated with significant pathogenesis particularly in mixed infections where immunosuppression occurs with subsequent decrease in marketability due to weight loss barnes 1997 the virus designated chicken infectious anemia virus ciav is a single-stranded circular dna-containing virus tentatively classified with two similar agents in a new family circoviridae the agent has only recently been recognized purified and characterized and its unequivocal role in economically important disease is not yet fully established purified virus inoculated into young chicks results in severe anemia and immunosuppression but inoculation of 2- to 3-week old birds results in little if any pathology yuasa and imai 1986 the virus has been associated with adult anemic conditions however in conjunction with other viral and bacterial infections and may thus play a significant role the agent is widespread in commercial poultry flocks worldwide and infection with the virus has been statistically related to a decrease in overall growth and performance chettle et al 1989a the extent to which two other tentative members of the family circoviridae  psittacine beak-and-feather disease virus bfdv and porcine circovirus  are related to ciav is under question and these stated taxonomic relationships may differ in the future bfdv has proven to be a significant pathogen in aviaries and commercial in psittacine birds to the extent that vaccines are now routinely administered recent evidence also suggests that circovirus particles can be detected by em and isolated from several other wild and captive bird species consequently the circoviridae may emerge as a more significant disease-causing agent in the near future the caliciviridae is a family of small single-strand positive-sense rna viruses with a polyadenylated genome virus-like particles resembling caliciviruses have been isolated from a variety of wild-bird and captive-raised species a chicken calicivirus has been replicated in cell culture and caused apparent gastrointestinal disease in specific pathogen-free day-old chicks cubitt and barrett 1985 intestinal contents of goldfinches with hemorrhagic enteritis have been found to contain calicivirus-like particles and gastrointestinal disease associated with caliciviruses has been reported in guinea fowl and pheasants gough et al 1985 caliciviruses were originally isolated from marine mammals and have caused disease in both domestic and feral swine due to consumption of uncooked garbage containing seafood interestingly caliciviruses have been detected in pelagic birds such as the white tern poet et al 1994 calicivirus isolations such as these lead to the speculation that wild sea birds may be important in the transmission of these agents across large areas or to other animals parvoviruses are the smallest of the dna-containing viruses carrying a single-stranded genome of about 5000 nucleotides they cause or are associated with three infections in birds kisary 1993 in wild and domestic geese and muscovy ducks derzys disease refers to a syndrome that had been variously called goose influenza goose hepatitis gosling enteritis and infectious myocarditis in different countries this collection of names gives some indication of the variety of signs associated with derzys disease the virus which can be transmitted horizontally and vertically induces differing pathologies depending on the age of the bird and in the case of hatchlings the level of maternal antibodies an interesting pathology often associated with infection of older birds is the virtually complete loss of feathers the extreme stability of the parvoviruses makes control of this disease difficult in commercial operations worldwide and the disease can result in 100 mortality in young hatchlings in chickens and young turkeys parvoviruses have been associated with runting stunting syndrome rss as have other agents experimental inoculations have indicated that the associated viruses which are distinct from the goose viruses can cause significant pathology but the extent to which these viruses participate in the rss is not yet established trampel et al 1983 decaesstecker et al 1986 another parvovirus the avian adeno-associated virus is almost always found associated with adenovirus infections in poultry the avian adeno-associated viruses are grouped with their mammalian counterparts in the dependovirus genus although they are serologically unrelated the avian dependovirus appears to contribute to disease only in the sense that it can affect multiplication of the associated adenoviruses yates and piela 1993 newcastle disease virus ndv classified as avian paramyxovirus-1 contains a single-strand negative-sense rna genome of 15 kb containing coding sequences for six genes the virus infects all bird species tested to date including free-living and domestic species one panzootic outbreak of the disease is thought to have originated in asia with subsequent spread to europe with outbreaks of disease first reported in poultry during the 1920s in java indonesia and newcastle-upon-tyne england worldwide dissemination of the disease particularly during the 1960s and 1970s has been attributed to increased international trade of both commercial poultry and pet birds this led to development of inactivated and live-virus vaccines for commercial poultry the transmission of infectious ndv may occur by either ingestion or inhalation and this knowledge is the basis for mass-application vaccination procedures during poultry production isolates of ndv are grouped into three main pathotypes depending on the severity of disease that they cause alexander and parsons 1974 mildly virulent lentogenic viruses may cause unnoticeable infections in adult chickens or a mild respiratory distress and are used extensively as live-virus vaccines mesogenic ndvs are of intermediate virulence and cause respiratory distress with mild infections of various organs detectable only by histopathology highly virulent viruses that cause severe morbidity and mortality are termed velogenic velogenic viruses can manifest themselves as neurotropic or viscerotropic forms of newcastle disease with extensive systemic replication throughout a bird virulent forms of ndv can replicate within cultures of most avian and mammalian cell types without the addition of trypsin while lentogens require added proteases for replication in cell culture the presence of dibasic amino acids at the proteolytic cleavage site pcs of the viral fusion protein and the ability of cellular proteases to cleave the fusion protein of various pathotypes specify the molecular basis for ndv virulence fewer basic amino acids are present in the fusion protein cleavage site of lentogenic ndv than is the case for mesogenic or velogenic isolates the presence of the increased number of dibasic amino acids in the fusion protein pcs sequence of ndv allows for systemic replication of these more pathogenic viruses in the host nagai et al 1976 although the principal concern with ndv is its effect on poultry production it may have severe consequences in other free-living avian species major outbreaks of newcastle disease have occurred in north american cormorants during the summers of 1990 and 1992 and again in 1997 outbreaks during 1990 and 1992 occurred in the north central united states and south central canada while in 1997 newcastle disease occurred among cormorants of the western united states and canada mortality in young nestlings in some areas was as high as 80 to 90 and the affected birds had characteristic neurotropic lesions heckert et al 1996 during the 1992 outbreak in cormorants an unvaccinated north dakota turkey flock became infected with ndv resulting in high mortality using nucleotide sequence analysis the virus causing disease in turkeys was proven to be the same virus isolated from afflicted cormorants in the central united states and canada the cormorant virus was also phylogenetically related to other known ndv isolates of psittacine origin seal et al 1995 that had caused a major outbreak in southern california poultry during the early 1970s that resulted in a depopulation of two million chickens utterback and schwartz 1973 illegal importation of pet bird species into the united states continues to be a source of highly virulent ndv and certainly may play a role in spread of viruses that threaten commercial poultry worldwide panigrahy et al 1993 what role free-living birds play in spread of ndv is unclear although persistent infections of chickens by ndv do not appear to occur the virus persistence in poultry flocks may result from virus reintroduced from wild populations also different bird species vary in their level of susceptibility to ndv ducks geese and certain psittacine birds do not exhibit signs of disease when infected with highly virulent ndv while other psittacine species may have high mortality persistent infections have been demonstrated in various psittacine birds with virus isolations noted up to a year following experimental infection of parrots with velogenic ndv chicken isolates erickson et al 1978 although psittacine birds have been directly linked as a source of ndv highly virulent for gallinaceous birds such as chickens and pheasants no studies have shown direct isolation of ndv from feral psittacines newcastle disease occurred in racing and show pigeons during the 1980s in both western europe and north america the outbreaks in western europe were linked to contaminated feed and disease was controlled in both areas via vaccination with mildly virulent ndv commonly used for poultry the virus isolated from these birds varied somewhat from traditionally virulent ndv in having only one set of dibasic amino acids in the fusion protein cleavage site increased virulence for poultry subsequently occurred only after passage in chickens collins et al 1994 these examples demonstrate the fact that variant forms of ndv may arise in different bird species and that free-living birds may be a constant source of viruses that affect both domestic and wild birds vaccination programs against ndv for the most part have been effective al controlling the virus in commercial poultry however all of the vaccine strains available today while effective against lethal disease share less sequence identity with currently circulating disease strains this is effectively illustrated in figure 2
 which may also be considered a useful example for other rna-containing viruses the phylogenetic tree demonstrates the relationship between current strains and the vaccine strains based on the sequence of the fusion protein it shows that vaccine strains are relatively far removed from the recent isolates coming from wild birds the future consequences of such heterologous vaccination approaches are unknown the same scenario might unfold for ndv as has occurred in the attempt to control mareks disease where the immune status of vaccinated flocks promotes generation of novel antigenic variants with new virulence characteristics avian influenza ai presents one of the most interesting ecological relationships between birds and their viruses its ecology has been reviewed in depth webster et al 1992 hinshaw et al 1980 but ai presents such a complete picture of a virus with multiple impacts on several species that it must be included in this chapter the type a orthomyxoviruses are essentially bird viruses the infections in birds can range from clinically inapparent with minimal serologic response to a devastating systemic disease that can result in 100 mortality within a matter of days there are 15 identified subtypes of ai viruses based on the hemagglutinin ha protein antigenic structure and nine subtypes based on the neuraminidase na structure these two genes code for the predominant surface glycoproteins which are embedded in the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope these are only 2 of 10 genes coded for by the virus the virus genetic material is contained on eight separate negative-sensed single-stranded rna segments ranging from 890 to 2450 nucleotides in length all of the ha and na viral subtypes have been identified in feral waterbirds and it has been proposed that these birds act as a natural reservoir for the virus webster et al 1992 slemons and easterday 1977 determination of the phylogenetic relationships of several genes from several subtypes of aiv collected from wild birds indicated that the general rate of evolution in the avian reservoir is low compared to the rate of evolution observed in human and other mammalian strains of type a orthomyxoviruses gorman et al 1992 other recent studies however have shown that the mutation rate of the ha gene and the ns gene even in wild birds approaches that seen in human strains garcia et al 1997 suarez and perdue et al 1998s measurement of clinical signs among infected migrating waterbirds is of course a difficult task thus far only a single instance of severe clinical signs has been associated with free-living birds  a lethal outbreak in terns in south africa in 1961 caused by an h5n1 strain becker 1966 given the recently measured mutation rates and the appearance of this severe lethality in a wild bird population it must be considered that aivs do continue to evolve in feral birds indeed 15 subtypes have arisen already there is no reason to believe that the present count of 15 subtypes will be the final tally while some have proposed that the aiv strain in wild birds causes no disease problems as a result of evolutionary stasis without question the virus has dramatic effects when it leaves this proposed reservoir in addition to the fixed influenza populations in pigs and horses avian strains can directly infect mammals and have been identified in whales seals and mink lang et al 1981 berg et al 1990 the dramatic association with seals in 1980 and 1982 mentioned earlier clearly points out the potential impact of aivs this avian reservoir then serves as a sort of base for the viral biological invasions that are a part of interspecies transmission ecologically and economically the transmission of these aiv subtypes to commercial poultry has perhaps yielded the most important impact the situation is most clearly played out in minnesota each year due to the large number of lakes in the state migratory waterfowl primarily anseriformes ducks geese frequent the area in large numbers seasonably nearby commercial turkey operations suffer infections nearly every year particularly in the cooler fall months caused by different influenza subtypes of different virulence halvorson et al 1985 in severe years the associated costs due to turkey mortality as well as performance and egg production losses can reach several millions of dollars poss and halvorson 1986 in chickens introduction of influenza viruses from waterfowl has been more devastating in the northeastern united states the h5 subtype caused the first large-scale outbreak of highly pathogenic ai in numerous flocks in 1983 twenty-three million birds were destroyed at a cost of more than 65000000 in order to contain the infection clinically the disease was indistinguishable from the disease originally described as fowl plague in 1927 in europe eckroade and silverman 1986 today we know that all of the classical fowl plague-type outbreaks have been associated exclusively with only two subtypes h5 and h7 evolution to virulence in these subtypes has been closely associated with accumulation of basic amino acids at the proteolytic cleavage site of the hemagglutinin protein bosch et al 1981 webster and rott 1987 in order for aiv strains to be infectious the ha protein must be cleaved into ha1 and ha2 subunits which subsequently allows structural rearrangement and exposure of a protein sequence needed to fuse the viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the target cell klenk et al 1975 skehel et al 1995 isolates of low pathogenicity lack multiple basic amino acids and are only cleaved by trypsin-like extracellular proteases these proteases are abundant on the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract and gut so the viruses replicate unrestricted at these sites the highly pathogenic hp forms however have additional basic amino acids which are recognized by the intracellular furin-like proteases ubiquitous in bird tissues rott et al 1995 thus in birds these viruses are able to escape the respiratory tract and infect a wider variety of internal tissues and organs this is one of the most important of the virulence factors webster and rott 1987 only two subtypes have been shown to accumulate these basic amino acids h7 and h5 these subtypes appear to do so by either base substitution or by insertion events wood et al 1993 perdue et al 1997 nucleotide insertion events appear to be the most common mechanism and table ii
and figure 3
illustrate what is presently known about occurrence of these hp virus isolates in commercial poultry the hp isolates with only two exceptions have additional inserted basic amino acids within the well-conserved region surrounding the cleavage site from the data in table ii and figure 3 it may be easily surmised that both the number of hp isolates and the number of basic amino acids at the cleavage site are increasing 
the avian influenza viruses are distributed worldwide in addition to the united states outbreaks of highly pathogenic ai have occurred in mexico canada europe asia and australia in most cases there is some sort of connection between the affected flocks and nearby waterfowl the extent to which the reservoir of viruses exists in waterfowl is not really known surveys have shown that in addition to the viruses being widespread the various subtypes increase and decrease in prevalence over successive years the order charadriiformes shorebirds and allies in addition to anseriiformes has been shown to carry aiv strains kawaoka et al 1988 and the extent to which aivs are carried in other orders has really only been superficially explored molecular and phylogenetic evidence have clearly shown that these segmented viruses share various genes back and forth within the populations of circulating virus strains garcia et al 1997 they are also capable of donating genes through genetic reassortment to viruses in swine and those genes ultimately end up in humans webster et al 1993 add this capacity to the known albeit rare transmission of purely avian influenza strains directly into mammals and one creates a potential ecological bonanza for the virus and potential nightmares for new hosts as advanced as our study of viruses has become there are still a variety of unknowns with regard to the extent to which avian viruses infect other vertebrates it would not be unreasonable to suggest that because of their mobility and longevity of existence that the class aves may have played a critical role in distribution of viruses to other classes in the case of the avian orthomyxoviruses phylogenetic evidence points to recent introduction of these viruses from birds to mammals following introduction the natural mutation and evolution of the virus produced strains that now appear to be adapted to their new hosts there are swine equine and human strains of type a influenza viruses that do not replicate well outside their respective host species if birds are indeed responsible for us coming down with the flu today we know of no reason why they might not have participated over the eons in the establishment of other purely mammalian diseases of course one could easily argue the opposite relationship but intuitively birds do present an ideal mobile vector particularly for the enterically transmitted viruses in addition to the diseases discussed here there is a growing group of emerging diseases or diseases of as yet unknown etiology in commercial poultry saif 1997 many of them have virus particles clearly associated with the syndrome but only limited research and characterization has been carried out thus far it is probably safe to assume that the future will continue to bring new avian diseases and bring to light new or undiscovered avian viruses the relationships existing among birds insects and viruses is one area that should be explored in more detail by increased research efforts in free-living birds the large number of apparently innocuous infections with bunyaviridae togaviridae and flaviviridae suggest that birds may act as an ecological reservoir for maintenance of these virus populations from a virocentric point of view if there is such a thing having a potentially highly mobile population of susceptible hosts on which transmission vectors may feed would be advantageous it would provide a mechanism by which to transfer viruses over large geographical distances where they could then be transmitted by new related or unrelated vectors thus increasing host range of course one runs the risk here of assuming that the virus would be ecologically improved by extending its replicative capacity in new hosts this may not be a valid assumption for example if variola virus or human poliovirus type 1 had been exploiting this strategy they made a bad choice in extending their host range into humans from one human vantage point birds provide a useful monitor for detection of arboviral diseases in a given area sentinel chickens are actually in use today along the east coast of the united states to gauge the extent to which some mosquito populations are carrying eastern equine encephalitis and st louis encephalitis viruses the future is perhaps the most important aspect to consider what viruses other than the orthomyxoviruses may someday establish a similar relationship where transmission to a mammalian intermediate or even direct transmission may allow introduction into the human population one fundamental unanswered question is whether birds acting as reservoirs for arboviruses should be considered an important ecological niche for those viruses there is no evidence of which we are aware to indicate either yes or no there have been no documented transmissions of arboviruses from birds to mammals without the insect vector in nature however so at this point wild birds could be considered dead-end hosts for the arboviruses in commercial poultry during outbreaks of the alphavirus eeev there is no evidence of infection of workers in close contact with infected birds if however a bird provides the necessary reservoir of eeev that infected the human then this bird becomes very important but there are no data that as yet identify the bird as the required reservoir for disease transmission to human newcastle disease virus provides an interesting new disease problem in humans that has only arisen as a result of increased vaccination of birds a live-virus vaccine is available for control of ndv that is administered by aerosol spray in a small number of cases where precautions have not been taken vaccinators can contract a conjunctivitis caused by the vaccine this outcome has been seen in the heavy poultry-producing areas of northern georgia on a common enough basis now to be easily recognized by ophthalmologists there is usually no seroconversion to the virus in these cases and they are not particularly serious infections there is also suggestive evidence in the form of measured seroconversion that poultry workers occasionally may be subclinically infected with avian coronaviruses and avian retroviruses the evidence for direct infection of humans with avian influenza viruses is growing human strains have classically included only three subtypes h13 until recently the only other strains shown to cause disease in humans were of the h7 subtype conjunctivitis caused by purely avian h7 subtype viruses has been reported on two occasions kurtz et al 1996 webster et al 1981a the most disturbing set of events however was the more recent highly publicized influenza outbreak in hong kong a purely avian h5 subtype virus was isolated from some 18 patients 6 of whom died from may through december of 1997 the index case a 3-year-old child in may followed a highly pathogenic outbreak of avian influenza that had just previously occurred in chickens in hong kong and its environs the child had been exposed to ill birds at a day care center and it was clear that the recovered virus was essentially the same as that recovered during the chicken outbreak considerable efforts were made to determine whether the virus was a contaminant and whether it was replicating in the child the evidence strongly suggested that it was indeed replicating subbarao et al 1998 subsequent to this event in novemberdecember the remaining confirmed cases were reported and an intense effort was mounted to determine exactly how this virus was transmitted it is clear now that the h5n1 viruses infecting humans in hong kong 1997 were all of avian origin suarez et al 1998 there is limited serologic suggestion of human-to-human transmission but no genetic evidence of adaptation to humans this case was touted as a premier test run for the next predicted influenza pandemic whether this outbreak represents a simple dead-end zoonotic transmission or whether these purely avian influenza viruses can become fixed in the human population is a matter for conjecture the avian h5 and h7 influenza strains have been the only natural influenza strains thus far to unequivocally cause systemic lethal infection in any species owing to the unique structure of their ha protein see fig 3 a major fear is that by adding such ha subtypes to a population of mammalian viruses a whole new class of virulent strains might be created our experience in working with numerous highly pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains has been one of very little or no evidence for human infection in the 25 years that scientists and technicians have spent working with hundreds of different stains but our experience has also been that when one attempts to confine influenza viruses by setting biological rules for them they usually find a way to break them if ecology is the study of the relationship of organisms to their environment for bird viruses the active pertinent environment is always within the bird and its tissues while one cannot discount the effects of the environment outside the host there are no positive effects on an avian virus life cycle outside the host of which we are aware that is there are no activation events outside the avian host of which we are aware only events of inactivation certainly avian viruses as all viruses have evolved survival strategies to allow passage from host to host and some are much more refractory to environmental inactivation than others but without really knowing which if any evolutionary direction viruses are taking it is impossible to determine whether a large herpesvirus of 150 genes is ecologically more fit than the enterovirus with five genes the relationship of birds and insects in the transmission and life cycle of the arboviruses is poorly understood until this recent transmission of h5n1 influenza strains to humans this relationship appeared to be the only significant one in which there is interaction among a genetically unaltered virus an avian host and a non-avian host as mentioned earlier other documented cases of avian-to-mammalian viral transmission are newcastle disease infections of humans and influenza a infections of mammals and humans there is also serological evidence for avian retrovirus and avian coronavirus infections in the case of newcastle disease the documented infections are mostly minor conjunctivitis in the case of influenza discussed earlier the avian viruses most often acquire rna segments from other sources before they are established in a new host thus in general the impact of avian viruses on public health might currently be considered small but clearly the potential exists for significant future impact a major interesting question arises when evaluating virulence of avian-origin viruses conventional wisdom seems to be suggesting that virus entry into naive host populations is more likely to result in a general decrease in virulence as the virus adapts to the new host morse 1994 this may be true under truly natural conditions but what happens under human-dictated conditions such as vaccination and by defining the host population through breeding and housing in the case of mareks disease we see an example of virulence increasing in the face of continued vaccination against the virus fig 1 whether this is occurring as a result of the vaccination or a combination of factors the fact is that the population of mareks disease herpesviruses in nature is becoming more virulent the vaccination programs for newcastle disease utilize vaccines whose genetic compositions are becoming farther and farther removed from the virulent strains circulating in wild fowl fig 2 this may not bode well for future control of virulent strains in commercial poultry in the case of avian influenza viruses we have seen the number of highly virulent outbreaks increase in recent years often following prior circulation of a nonpathogenic precursor and we have seen concomitant changes in genetic structure related to virulence fig 3 again there are unknowns in this system but the fact remains that we are seeing more virulence as the nonpathogenic aiv subtypes replicate in commercial poultry settings thus this naive commercial population unlike the waterfowl hosts to which the virus has adapted appears to allow generation of heretofore unencountered virulence phenotypes similar scenarios appear to be playing out as more virulent infectious bronchitis strains and infectious bursal disease strains appear worldwide one must be cautious then in working strictly under the previously mentioned virulence-decrease paradigms for mammalian viruses these have been suggested mostly by the experiences with artificial introduction of rabbit papilloma viruses in australia or where new introductions occur as human encroachment ensues such as in the recent cases of ebola virus or monkey poxvirus infections in these cases it was proposed that virus transmission results first in high virulence for the host followed by subsequent adaptation and attenuation finally it may be dangerous to attempt to confine avian viruses to some of our more logical inferences based on darwinian evolution one paraphrased definition of evolution is moving from a prior more primitive or less fit state to a current more advanced or more fit state it is difficult for us at least to say that any avian viruses are following such a progression additionally other than use as molecular biological vectors viruses in general have not been shown to provide anything positive to the ecology of any other organisms the future may yet reveal such relationships but for now ridding ourselves of these fascinating parasites by continuing such policies as those resulting in the eradication of smallpox and polio still appears to be our most prudent course  mutations in sars-cov-2 viral rna identified in eastern india possible implications for the ongoing outbreak in india and impact on viral

coronavirus disease covid-19 which has infected millions of people and is responsible for more than 200000 deaths worldwide in a span of just 4 months the virus has a positive sense single-stranded rna genome which is around 30 kb in length the genome codes for four structural and multiple non-structural proteins astuti and ysrafil 2020 while the structural proteins form capsid and envelope of the virus non-structural proteins are involved in various steps of viral life cycle such as replication translation packaging and release lai and cavanagh 1997 although at a slower rate mutations are emerging in the sars-cov-2 genome which might modulate viral transmission replication efficiency and virulence in different regions of the world jia et al2020 pachetti et al2020  the genome sequence data has revealed that sars-cov-2 is a member of the genus betacoronavirus and belongs to the subgenus sarbecovirus that includes sars-cov while mers-cov belongs to a separate subgenus merbecovirus lu et al2020 wu et al2020 zhu et al2020 sars-cov-2 is approximately 79 similar to sars cov at the nucleotide sequence level epidemiological data suggests that sars-cov-2 had spread widely from the city of wuhan in china chinazzi et al2020 after its zoonotic transmission originating from bats via the malayan pangolins zhang et al2020 global sequence and epidemiological data reveals that since its emergence sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly to all parts of the globe facilitated by its ability to use the human ace2 receptor for cellular entry hoffmann et al2020 the accumulating mutations in the sars-cov-2 genome have resulted in the evolution of 11 clades out of which the ancestral clade o originated in wuhan since the first report of sequence of sars-cov-2 from india there have been multiple sequence submissions in global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg extensive sequencing of the viral genome from different regions in india is required urgently this will provide information on the prevalence of various viral clades and any regional differences therein which might lead to improved understanding of the transmission patterns tracking of the outbreak and formulation of effective containment measures the mutation data might provide important clues for development of efficient vaccines antiviral drugs and diagnostic assays we have initiated a study on sequencing of sars-cov-2 genome from swab samples obtained from infected individuals from different regions of west bengal in eastern india and report here the first nine sequences and the results of analysis of the sequence data with respect to other sequences reported from the country until date we have detected unique mutations in the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp spike s and nucleocapsid n coding viral genes it appears that the mutation in nucleocapsid gene might lead to alterations in local structure of the n protein also the putative sites of mirna binding could be affected which might have major consequences the possible implications of the mutations have been discussed which will provide important insights for functional validation to understand the molecular basis of differential disease severity

omega was used to display the mutations in the context of the sequence alignments bioedit software v72 was used to extract the cds from consensus sequence and to check codon usage nucleotide to amino acid conversion was done in emboss transeq online tool f madeira et al2019 to generate the clustering patterns of the viral sequences from west bengal a subset of representative virus sequence data n  310 were downloaded from gisaid global database supplementary table 1 only high coverage data where the entries have less than 1 ns and less than 005 amino acid mutations complete genome entries with base pair greater than 29000 and excluding low coverage entries entries having more than 5 ns were used in the analysis all of the sequences were aligned using mafft multiple alignment using fast fourier transform we used the nextstrain pipeline to process the sequence data nextstrain with the augur pipeline was used to build phylogenetic tree based on the iqtree method which is a fast and effective stochastic algorithm to infer phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood the tree building process involves the use of these subtypes wuhan-hu-12019 wuhanwh012019 to generate the root of the tree the tree is refined using raxml randomized axelerated maximum likelihood a web-based visualization program auspice was then used to present and interact with phylogenetic and phylogeographic data we investigated the potential mirna binding site in the region coding for n protein found to be mutated in our samples starmir httpsfoldwadsworthorgcgi-binstarmirtest2pl software was used for this purpose the whole human mature mirna library was obtained from mirbase database the sequence in query was taken 50 nt upstream and 50 nt downstream from the site of mutation the mirnas which bind to the mutation site through seed sequence were shortlisted the change in bases can prevent certain mirna binding and support the binding of others therefore mirna binding was checked for both original and mutated site we checked the levels of mirnas in the cancer conditions around the upper respiratory tract in the dbdemc2 database httpswwwpicbaccndbdemc the tissueatlas database httpsccb-webcsuni-saarlanddetissueatlas was used to analyse the presence and correlation of mirnas in body fluids all patients were diagnosed positive for sars-cov-2 rna by real time pcr as described above five of the patients suffered from fever while seven patients exhibited some symptoms of infection like sore throat cough with sputum running nose or breathlessness one patient suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome ards two patients did not exhibit any symptom table 1 five individuals had contact with covid-19 patients in particular both s2 and s3 had contact with the same patient table 1 one individual had history of international travel while another had history of domestic travel the shotgun rna-seq data resulted in high coverage greater than 100x median depth of coverage of complete genome sequences of the sars-cov-2 in five samples s2 s3 s5 s6 and s11 in which greater than 96 of the viral genome was covered at greater than 5x and greater than 99 of the viral genome was covered at greater than 1x a negative correlation was found between viral load represented by the threshold cycle or ct value of the rna samples in the real time pcr based diagnostic assay and the number of reads mapped to the viral genome in the rna-seq library even with 9 samples the pearson correlation coefficient was found to be 063 p value  0036 table 1 in particular it was observed that samples with ct values greater than 25 mostly resulted in generation of low counts of viral sequence reads leading to less than 15x median depth of coverage of the viral genome in the remaining four samples s1 s8 s10 and s12 the median depth of coverage was less than 15x and hence the viral genome sequencing was achieved after amplification of the viral genome by a multiplex pcr approach all the nine sequences have been submitted in the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid database phylogenetic tree analysis of the sequences along with other complete viral genome sequences submitted from india in gisaid revealed that seven of these sequences belonged to the a2a clade while only one sequence belonged to clade b4 figure 1 and table 1 we were unable to classify one of the nine sequences s1 into any clade due to low sequence coverage to understand transmission histories of these nine sars-cov-2 isolates from west bengal we aligned these sequences with more than 6000 global sequences including thirty sequences submitted in gisaid from india at the time of our analysis to identify specific mutations that occur at the highest level of the tip in a branch leading to the specific subtype the predicted origin of the transmitted subtype in each case was identified with 98-100 confidence from the branch in which our samples were located in the phylogenetic tree table 1 the list of mutations detected in the sequences from nine samples are provided table 2 seven sequences harboured the important signature mutations of a2a clade these consisted of the 14408 ct mutation resulting in a change of p323l in the rdrp and the 23403 ag mutation resulting in a change of d614g in the spike glycoprotein of the virus in addition to these 24933 gt mutation in the gene coding for spike glycoprotein g1124v and triple base mutations of 2881-2883 gggaac in the gene coding for nucleocapsid resulting in two consecutive amino acid changes r203k and g204r were detected in s2 s3 and s2 s3 s5 respectively while the 24933 gt s gene mutation was unique to these samples and could not be found in any other sequence from india or the rest of the world the nucleocapsid mutations could be detected in only three other sequences from india figure 2 out of these two sequences were obtained from individuals with contact history of a covid-19 patient who had travelled from italy interestingly two out of three sequences harbouring these mutations obtained by us belonged to kolkata and with contact history with one covid-19 patient who had travelled from london uk the third sequence was obtained from a covid-19 patient from darjeeling india who had history of travel from chennai india these mutations have been found in 16 of sars-cov-2 sequences reported world-wide from countries like uk netherlands iceland belgium portugal usa australia brazil etc rdrp nsp12 gene of the sars-cov-2 codes for the rna-dependent rna polymerase and is vital for the replication machinery of the virus we detected a total of six mutations in this gene in the nine samples out of which four were nonsynonymous including the a2a clade specific 14408 ct rdrp p323l mutation two individuals s11 and s12 harboured viral genome sequences that shared a unique 13730 ct a88v mutation which was not found in any other sequence reported from india or rest of the world one individual s10 whose viral sequence belonged to b4 clade harboured 3 mutations in rdrp which appear to be clade specific out of which 2 were nonsynonymous to study the functional relevance of the mutations we investigated the alteration in mirna binding in the nucleocapsid coding region predicted to be caused by the 28881-3 gggaac mutations we found seven mirnas which bind to the original sequence and three which bind the mutated sequence exclusively table 3 and figure 3 the number of bases in the sequence gggaac which bind the seed sequence of mirna were also identified the strength of mirna prediction is reflected by the g value mentioned in the figure 3 lesser the value stronger is the binding the values are comparable to some of the experimentally validated mirna bindings like mir122 binding to hcv rna has g value of 183 kcalmol for s1 binding site and 226 kcalmol for s2 binding site data not shown the values of g obtained for the mirnas binding to n protein coding region are comparable to these values suggesting their relevance in the in vivo conditions we checked the levels of these mirnas in cancer conditions around the upper respiratory tract in the dbdemc2 database we found that mir-24-1-5p and mir-299-5p were downregulated in most of the cancers mir-24-2-5p was found to be upregulated in esophageal cancer esca head and neck cancer hnsc lung cancer luca and downregulated in nasopharyngeal cancer nsca supplementary figure 1 assuming that the binding of mirnas would inhibit the viral replicationstability higher abundance of that mirna would be protective against infection and lower abundance would increase the susceptibility towards infection to comprehend the results we have found that if a patient suffering from esca hnsc luca is infected with the original virus containing ggg sequence the upregulated mir-24-2-5p would be protective against the infection but if the same patient is infected with the mutated virus containing aac sequence mir-24-2-5p will not be functional anymore and mir-299-5p which targets the mutated site is also downregulated this could make the patients suffering from described cancers highly susceptible to infection with the mutant virus we also checked if these mirnas are associated with other disease conditions and found that mir-299-5p is down regulated in type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm and hence could serve as one of factors for increased susceptibility of t2dm patients for the mutated viral subtype and increase the risk of co-morbidity huang et al2018 another mir-3162-3p targeting original subtype is reported to be higher in asthma patients fang et al2016 this could be one of the factors limiting the original viral propagation but the loss of its targeting site in mutated viral subtype could increase the host susceptibility towards viral infection we further checked if there are some other conditions that could alter the availability of these mirnas at the site of infection therefore we used the tissueatlas database to analyse the presence and correlation of these mirnas in body fluids we found that there is differential expression of certain mirnas in the saliva of patients suffering from pancreatic cancer mir-642b-5p mir-3162-3p and mir-299-5p were found to be upregulated in the saliva of pancreatic cancer patients which could provide similar protectivesusceptible effect as mentioned of mirnas before supplementary figure 2 mirnas have been known to affect viral replication and stability by binding to protein coding regions of the genome of h1n1 ev71 cvb3 and many more viruses bruscella et al2017 trobaugh and klimstra 2017 in most of the cases binding of mirnas leads to translational repression of the targeted protein and hence directly affects viral rna replication targeting by mirnas could decrease the levels of n protein which is involved in various steps of viral life cycle including replication translation and coating of viral rna to form the nucleocapsid hence altered levels of the shortlisted mirna could regulate various viral processes and severity of sars-cov-2 infection the effect of mirnas would be opposite if they assist in viral replicationstability but that needs to be experimentally confirmed and still holds the importance of mirnas targeting the original and mutated sites we analysed the 28881-3 gggaac mutations in the nucleocapsid gene which results in contiguous amino acid changes of r203k and g204r for their potential role in alteration of structure of the encoded protein the sites of these mutations at position are located in the sr-rich region which is known to be intrinsically disordered chang et al2014 in addition this region is known to encompass a few phosphorylation sites surjit et al2005 notably the gsk3 phosphorylation site at ser202 and a cdk phosphorylation site at ser206 which are in close proximity to these mutations the sequence motifs srgts 202-206 and spar 206-209 are entirely consistent with gsk3 and cdk phosphorylation motifs respectively when ser202 is phosphorylated which incorporates a large negative group tethered to the sidechain of ser as seen in many other substrates of kinases it is likely that charge neutralization takes place involving positively charged sidechains in the sequential and spatial vicinity arg203 is a part of gsk3 phosphorylation motif and its sidechain could potentially contribute to charge neutralization at p-ser202 given the sequential and therefore spatial proximity of arg203 to p-ser206 the sidechain of arg203 could potentially be involved in interaction also with phosphate group at position 206 this interaction would contribute to reduction of conformational entropy similarly arg209 a part of cdk phosphorylation motif would contribute to charge neutralization at p-ser206 arg203 and gly204 are mutated to lys and arg respectively figure 4 spike protein s of coronaviruses is a class i viral fusion protein which is synthesized as a single chain precursor that trimerizes upon folding it is composed of two subunits s1 in the amino terminal containing the receptor binding domain rbd and s2 in the carboxy terminal that drives membrane fusion figure 5 while the s1 n-terminal region comprises of domain a the s1 c-terminal half folds as three spatially distinct domains b c and d walls et al2016 wrapp et al2020 the s protein pre-dominantly exists in two structurally distinct conformations pre-fusion and post-fusion li 2016 the pre-fusion state is metastable interactions between the protomers facilitated through interlocking of the s1 subunit around the s2 trimer in a crown-like fashion stabilizes the pre-fusion conformation walls et al2016 transition from pre-fusion to post-fusion state involves large conformational change to fuse the viral membrane with host cell membrane this process is triggered when s binds to hace2 protein via the sb domain to enter the host cell the ectodomain trimer of s protein in coronaviruses are known to adopt multiple sb conformations walls et al2020 at the time of preparing this manuscript three pre-fusion state structures of sars-cov-2 s protein solved by cryo-em are available which encompass the two sites of mutation d614 and g1124 of our interest while one of these three structures pdb code 6vxx walls et al2020 is in a perfectly closed state ie the sb domain in all the three protomers of the trimeric s protein are in a closed conformation the other two structures pdb codes 6vyb and 6vsb walls et al2020 wrapp et al2020 are in partially open state in 6vyb the sb domain in chain b is in open state whereas it has a closed conformation in chain a and c in 6vsb the sb domain in chain a is in open state whereas it has a closed conformation in the other two chains b and c in all the three structure d614 lies in a loop at the interface between any two out of the three protomers the co-ordinates for the d614 side-chain in chain a and c of 6vyb are available only up to c-atom and the orientation of these atoms are similar to that observed in the respective atoms of d614 in 6vxx the co-ordinates of all the side-chain atoms of d614 in chain b of 6vyb are available and they are similar to that observed in chain b of 6vxx the side-chain of d614 in all the protomers of 6vxx and chain b of 6vyb point outward from the core of the protein toward the solvent the side-chain orientation of d614 in all the three chains of 6vsb is different from the former two structures this differential orientation of d614 side-chain in 6vsb facilitates formation of hydrogen bond between d614 present in s1 subunit and t859 present in s2 subunit from the neighbouring chain in two out of the three interfaces found in 6vsb figure 6 taken together these facts suggest that d614 is highly flexible and support the wobbly nature of the inter-protomeric hydrogen bond observed between d614 and t859 contribution of this transient hydrogen bond toward stability of the pre-fusion state cannot be negated interestingly s protein of mouse coronavirus mhv-a59 which has a similar structural topology as that of the sars-cov-2 s protein but shares a low overall sequence identity 32 has a conservative substitution at the position equivalent to d614 of the latter the asn n655 of mouse coronavirus mhv-a59 is replaced with asp d614 in sars-cov-2 figure 5 and figure 7 in earlier literature n655 has been suggested to offer inter-protomeric interactions that contribute toward maintenance of the s2 fusion machinery in its metastable state ac walls et al2016 given the conservation of asp at this position in closely related coronaviruses bat coronaviruses btcov-ratg13 and btcov-hku3 sars-cov and its conservative substitution in mouse coronavirus mhv-a59 it is likely that d614 is important for structural stability of s protein as gly lacks a side-chain the transient hydrogen bond as observed in the wild-type s protein would be lost in the variant with d614g mutation this can potentially compromise on the structural stability of pre-fusion state of s protein possibly interfering with conformational transitions moreover replacement of asp with gly at this position would come with higher conformational freedom at the backbone c ramakrishnan and gn ramachandran 1965 of the polypeptide resulting in enhancement of local conformational entropy the gly at this position is solvent exposed and is present at the tip of the c-terminal end of a -strand this position is proximal to the region where the s protein attaches itself to the viral membrane figure 5 it is to be noted that the gly at this position is conserved among the closely related coronaviruses bat coronavirus ratg13 and hku3 sars-cov hinting toward its possible role in maintenance of structure and function of the s protein figure 7 in general as explained above gly backbone has higher conformational freedom than any other amino acid residues ramakrishnan and ramachandran 1965 therefore substitution of gly with val would impart rigidity to the local region the possible implication of such rigidity on the association of s protein with viral membrane could be understood from a structure of s protein in association with the viral membrane however such a structure is currently unavailable substantial uncertainties surround the trajectory of the recent epidemic of covid-19 in india it is extremely important to track the outbreak by analysing the phylogenetic relationships between different sars-cov-2 genomes prevalent in india and compare them with genomes reported from rest of the world the error-prone replication process of all rna viruses in general results in introduction of mutations in their genomes which behave as a molecular clock that can provide insights into the emergence and evolution of the virus the data till date suggests that sars-cov-2 emerged not long before the first cases of pneumonia in wuhan occurred wu et al2020 in this study direct massively parallel sequencing of the viral genome was undertaken on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples collected from infected individuals from different districts of west bengal we have analysed the first nine sequences in this report recent analysis of sars-cov-2 sequences from all over the globe has revealed that the outbreaks have been initially triggered in most countries by the original strain from wuhan clade o which thereafter have diversified into multiple clades yadav et al2020 biswas and majumder 2020 temporal sweeps leading to replacement of the ancestral o and other clades by a2a have been detected until our report initial sequences from samples obtained from individuals with travel history to china reported genetic similarity to the clade o which was obtained at the beginning of the outbreak in wuhan china rest of the sequences reported from india mostly belonged to either clade a3 18 or a2a 44 supplementary table 3 with evidence of the temporal sweep where the a2a is emerging as the predominant clade biswas and majumder 2020 the a2a clade is characterized by the signature nonsynonymous mutations leading to amino acid changes of p323l in the rdrp which is involved in replication of the viral genome and the change of d614g in the spike glycoprotein which is essential for the entry of the virus in the host cell by binding to the ace2 receptor notably the d614g mutation is close to the furin recognition site for cleavage of the spike protein which plays an important role in virus entry whether both these mutations have resulted in the evolution of a more transmissible viral subtype ie the a2a clade is yet to be verified by in vitro and in silico analyses interestingly we also found that one of viral sequences in our study belonged to the b4 clade which originated in china gonzalez-reiche et al2020 b4 clade sequences have not been reported from india earlier and are only less than 1 of sequences reported worldwide probably the individual s10 was transmitted this subtype by contact with others who had travel history to china although this information was not available in the patient clinical history emergence of viral subclones in an outbreak can affect the transmission patterns and disease severity which are immensely important for public health harvala et al2017 jones et al2019 given the large size of the infected population in india with the possibility of regional differences in the population and host-related factors this can have the potential to affect the course of the outbreak population surveillance is essential for early detection of emergence of such subclones we analysed the mutations detected in each sequence that we generated and found preliminary evidence of this we found that three individuals of this study viz s2 s3 and s5 shared rare set of three contiguous mutations in their genome which resulted in the consecutive alterations of r203k and g204r these mutations were also found to be shared with 3 other sequences reported from western india interestingly while two out the three sequences harbouring these mutations were from individuals who shared contact history with a covid-19 patient with history of travel from italy two out of the three samples from west bengal shared contact history with the same covid-19 patient with history of travel from uk the third individual whose sample harboured these mutations viz s5 was found to have history of travel from chennai india but the possibility of the patient having contact in transit with an individual with international travel history cannot be excluded additionally origin of the viral subtypes infecting s5 and s6 has also been predicted by phylogenetic analysis to be europe uk s6 had been infected in delhi india where he had contact with an infected individual who travelled from europe one of the individuals s10 harboured a viral subtype which is predicted to have been transmitted in china s2 and s3 who shared an identical sequence of the virus also harboured one unique mutation resulting in the amino acid alteration of g1124v in the spike protein this correlates with the fact that these two individuals had also been known to have contact with the same covid-19 patient viral rna sequences obtained from two samples s11 and s12 shared all mutations except a v32l mutation at orf8 harboured by s11 and not by s12 interestingly both these individuals belonged to the same district of east medinipur had history of contact with covid-19 patients and did not exhibit any clinical symptom thus our findings indicate that the viral subtypes transmitted in the eastern region of india in particular west bengal have mostly originated from europe and also china sequencing of large number of samples are being presently undertaken to confirm and elaborate these initial findings rdrp is essential for replication of viral rna genome and hence this gene is expected to be conserved interestingly we detected multiple mutations in this gene the majority of which were non synonymous and hence result in alteration of protein sequence in particular the p323l was present in all a2a sequences in our samples this mutation is located adjacent to a hydrophobic cleft in rdrp which is a promising target for potential drugs pachetti et al2020 sequences from two samples s11 and s12 shared a unique rdrp mutation at a88v which has not been detected until date in rest of the sequences submitted from india or worldwide as observed earlier these two samples harbour viral subtypes whose genomes are strikingly similar sequence obtained from one of the samples s10 which belonged to the clade b4 did not possess the p323l mutation instead it harboured three different mutations resulting in two non-synonymous changes of h286y p287t and a synonymous mutation which were not found in any other sequences reported from india until date and are specific for the b4 clade it remains to be seen whether these amino acid alterations result in substantial changes in structure or function of rdrp resulting in emergence of drug resistant subtypes or enhancement in mutation rate in the viral genome we investigated the potential of the mutations detected in the nucleocapsid region to effect alterations in the viral and host processes we found that this mutation results in considerable alterations in the predicted binding of mirnas which might play a role in the establishment and progress of infection in the patient we also found that some of the mirnas which are predicted to bind to the mutated subtype might be downregulated in multiple cancer types this raises the possibility that cancer patients might have higher susceptibility to the mutated sub-clone due to the reduced ability to contain the virus in vivo compared to infection by the original virus of the same clade the leads obtained from this study need to be pursued to develop mirna based novel therapeutic approaches we also analysed the predicted structural alterations in the viral nucleocapsid protein which might be caused by consecutive alterations of r203k and g204r as a result of these mutations we have two strong positively charged residues in close sequential positions as opposed to only one positively charged residue in the other genotype given the structural vicinity of p-ser202 and p-ser206 and the long sidechains of lys and arg with high positive charge and significant side-chain conformational freedom in this genotype both these residues potentially could contribute to charge neutralization of the phosphorylated serine residues this contributes to further reduction of conformational entropy compared to the other genotype while lys203 is likely to offer electrostatic interactions to p-ser202 arg204 with a greater number of positively charged centres as compared to lys could potentially simultaneously interact with the phosphate groups at both p-ser202 and p-ser206 together these two positively charged residues lys203 and arg204 have the potential to offer additional interactions to the phosphorylated serine residues at 202 and 206 positions as opposed to only one of them arg203 in the other genotype consequently one can expect a significant difference in conformational entropy as well as in the inter-residue interaction structural network between the two genotypes especially when ser202 and ser206 are phosphorylated further gly at position 204 in one of the genotypes would confer significantly higher conformational freedom at the backbone ramakrishnan and ramachandran 1965 of the polypeptide chain compared to arg in the equivalent position in the other genotype this mutation adds another dimension to the likely structural differences in this local region of the two genotypes subsequently phosphorylation-mediated functional events might be different in the two genotypes surjit and lal 2008 surjit et al2006 these proposed differences in the inter-residue structural network between the two genotypes are depicted schematically in figure 4 admittedly the proposed network of interactions is fraught with uncertainty however given two positively charged residues in one genotype compared to only one in the other genotype the charge neutralization structural interaction networks involving p-ser202 and p-ser206 has to be certainly different going by the highly established literature on kinase substrates kitchen et al2008 krupa et al2004 interestingly the mutations d614g in sd domain is supposed to confer flexibility in the sd domain and the mutation g1124v might impart partial rigidity in the conformation of s2 domain obvious question is whether such structural alterations in local region would have any consequence in receptor binding affinity of spike protein since the mutation resides in rbd domain- s1 subunit of spike protein residue 614 is not directly involved in the interaction with ace2 but the mutation might have some effect on the positioning of the residues involved in interaction now to address the concerns whether these mutations are expected to affect the sensitivity of the existing diagnostic kit we have again explored the implications of the structural changes most likely the presence of mutation should not affect the rapid detection kits because these kits detect the presence of specific iggigm antibody against viral n protein or viral s protein the whole protein is coated for the test and therefore polyclonal antibodies would provide the result here change in just one epitope might not affect the overall result we have further checked if the mutation sites fall in immunodominant epitopes this data is available for sars proteins and the sites where we have found mutation have been shown to be conserved in sars and sars-cov-2 while the mutation site of n protein does not elicit much antibody response region 603-634 of the s protein of sars has been shown to be a major immunodominant epitope in s protein he et al2004 change in this epitope by mutation could alter the sensitivity of the iggigm tests conducted also there are certain diagnostic kits being designed to check the presence of viral antigen in the clinical sample the abundance of antibodies targeting the mutation sites needs to be checked in those kits to be more effective across the viral strains harbouring different mutations we also detected interesting relationships between ct value of diagnostic assay as a surrogate of viral copy number and viral sequence reads obtained we recommend that for future sequencing studies the shotgun rna-seq approach should be used for high viral copy number represented by low ct values while for rest a viral genome amplification method should be used although the sample size of our preliminary report is small follow up studies are underway to confirm these observations for understanding the impact of the same in the ongoing outbreak of covid-19 in india we have not commented on the relationship of the viral sequence alterations with disease severity due to the limited sample size of this analysis we hope to provide valuable information on this aspect based on the expanded number of samples being sequenced at present our findings provide leads which might benefit outbreak tracking and development of therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to contain the infection finally we conclude that the initial sequences generated by us from first nine samples in west bengal in eastern india indicate a selective sweep of the a2a clade of sars-cov-2 however the viral population is not homogenous and other clades like b4 also exist we have also detected emergence of mutations in the important regions of the viral genome including spike rdrp and nucleocapsid coding genes some of these mutations are predicted to have impact on viral and host factors which might affect transmission and disease severity this preliminary evidence of emergence of multiple subclones of sars-cov-2 which might have altered phenotypes can have important consequences on

two surface proteins haemagglutinin h and neuraminidase n which govern the viral lifecycle at cellular entry and release of virions all subtypes of influenza a virus from h1 to h16 and n1 to n9 are detected in wild water birds h17n10 is found in bats1 although most infections with these subtypes are mild or asymptomatic in avian species outbreaks in wild birds and poultry have been associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza h5 and outbreaks in poultry have been associated with h7 subtypes1 2 human infections are generally confined to h1 h2 and h3 subtypes because these subtypes have affinity for host cell receptors containing -26-linked sialic acid which occur in human beings whereas other avian influenza viruses generally preferentially attach to avian host cell receptors which contain -23-linked sialic acid direct transmission of avian influenza viruses from domestic poultry to people have been documented only for the h5n1 h7n2 h7n3 h7n7 h9n2 and h10n7 subtypes1 3 4 5 6 7 human infections due to these subtypes were generally mild and manifested as conjunctivitis and upper-respiratory-tract infections except for the h5n1 subtype which was associated with mortality of greater than 50 and the h7n7 subtype which has caused one death1 4 since february 2013 a novel reassortant h7n9 virus associated with human deaths but no apparent outbreaks in poultry and wild birds

 serial samples from patient 2 were tested throat swab samples were consistently negative but sputum samples were positive table 3 h7n9 virus was isolated from respiratory specimens from patients 1 3 and 4 in cell culture and confirmed by rt-pcr in which h7-specific and n9-specific primers were used no viral co-infections were detected by multiplex pcr and no bacterial or fungal co-infections were detected in 14 blood cultures and 16 respiratory secretion cultures two of five pigeons 40 four of 20 chickens 20 zero of four quails 0 and zero of 57 ducks 0 tested positive for the h7n9 virus sequence analysis of patient 3 and an epidemiologically linked chickens h 1673 of 1683 bases 994 and n 1394 of 1398 bases 997 genes showed that the human h7n9 isolate was almost identical to chicken h7n9 isolate the h7 in the isolates clustered with h of the h7n3 of ducks in zhejiang and the isolate n9 clustered with the n of the h7n9 of wild birds in korea figure 3
 the six internal genes of the isolate h7n9 are closest to those of poultry h9n2 viruses of china figure 4
 analysis of the h7 receptor binding site showed a gln226leu substitution in the human isolate and a gly186val substitution h3 numbering in both human and chicken isolates table 4
 no multibasic aminoacids were noted at the proteolytic cleavage site of this h7 in either the human or the chicken isolates although the pb2 glu627lys substitution frequently detected in human h5n1 isolates was not noted an asp701asn substitution was noted in the human isolate deletion of five aminoacids in the stalk region of n9 at position 6973 n9 numbering was noted in the human and chicken h7n9 isolates we detected a premature stop codon near the c-terminus of ns1 leading to pdz motif deletion in all h7n9 isolates a ser31asn substitution of the m2 gene associated with adamantane resistance was recorded in both isolates but we noted no resistance mutations associated with neuraminidase inhibitors we diagnosed avian influenza a h7n9 in all four patients who were epidemiologically unlinked two of whom died and two of whom were recovering at the time of writing panel
 all patients had histories of occupational or wet market exposure to poultry the genes of the h7n9 virus in patient 3s isolate were phylogenetically clustered with those of the epidemiologically linked wet market chicken h7n9 isolate human and chicken isolate h7 clustered with that of h7n3 of ducks in zhejiang and human and chicken isolate n9 clustered with that of h7n9 of wild birds in korea and the six internal genes of the isolate h7n9 are closest to those of poultry h9n2 viruses of china these findings suggest sporadic poultry-to-person transmissionpanelresearch in context
systematic review
we searched pubmed on april 11 2013 with the terms influenza avian h5 h5n1 h7 h9 and h10 for articles published in english our search did not reveal any reports of avian influenza a h7n9 virus infection in human beings before 2013 we noted only reports of poultry outbreaks caused by some h7n9 virus strains which were usually weakly pathogenic for avian species all reported human infections with avian influenza a virus were caused by h5n1 h7n2 h7n3 h7n7 h9n2 and h10n7 subtypes severe community-acquired pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction due to h5n1 infection was associated with a mortality rate of more than 50 and one death due to the h7n7 subtype has been reported4 however most h7 viruses and other subtypes caused mild respiratory illness or conjunctivitis in people most cases were attributed to avian-to-person transmission and there was little evidence of first generation person-to-person transmission
interpretation
our study showed that human infections with the avian influenza a h7n9 virus were acquired from live poultry markets in china evidenced by the phylogenetic relatedness between viruses in isolates from a patient and an epidemiologically linked chicken markers of mammalian adaptation were found in the human virus isolate clinical manifestation of this new emerging infection is similar to that of h5n1 infection and can be fatal in patients with substantial cytokine activation and multiorgan dysfunction further virological study is important to establish diagnosis and allow early treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors and infection control rising poultry and human populations will increase the emergence of novel avian influenza viruses infecting human beings as was the case with influenza a h5n1 virus in 19972 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus in 200315 and human coronavirus emc in 201216 17 infection with a novel virus was suspected because the pneumonia of these patients did not respond to typical and atypical antibiotic coverage the four patients were clustered within zhejiang china within a few weeks when migratory birds were moving north and transiting at the yangtze river delta however unlike other types of avian influenza affecting human beings no increase in poultry deaths was noticed before the onset of human infections after diagnosis of influenza a h7n9 infection was confirmed in patient 1 by rt-pcr additional and retrospective testing of 486 patients between march 7 and april 8 2013 led to the discovery of three further infected patients similar to those infected with h5n1 our patients had few upper-respiratory-tract symptoms1 they presented with high fevers lower-respiratory-tract symptoms especially dyspnoea and radiological features of consolidation and ground glass changes multiorgan involvement was shown by abnormal results of liver and renal function tests myalgia with high creatine kinase concentrations suggestive of myositis impaired coagulation and severe lymphopenia gastrointestinal symptoms were noted only in patient 1a profile that differs from that in previous reports of h5n1 or severe a h1n1 pdm09 infections1 respiratory failure progressed within 314 days and death 13 weeks after onset of symptoms however none of these clinical radiological or laboratory findings was pathognomonic oseltamivir was begun late mean 16 days after symptom onset because of the late presentation of respiratory failure and delay in virological diagnosis similar to the cytokine storm noted in h5n1 infection the substantially increased concentrations of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory serum cytokines and chemokines in patient 3 who died were compatible with the clinical severity of this novel h7n9 infection18 in particular the serum concentrations of interleukin 10 were persistently increased in patient 3a finding similar to that for severe a h1n1 pdm09 infection12 although serial rt-pcr assays of sputum samples from patient 2 were positive for viral infection cycle thresholds were low 1520 days after onset of symptoms and corroborated well with decreasing serum cytokine and chemokine concentrations besides the likely absence of protection by pre-existing neutralising antibodies in the general population the internal genes from the h9n2 virus might also contribute to the severe pathogenesis of this novel infection double and even triple reassortant avian h9n2 viruses were well reported19 and the six internal genes of the 1997 h5n1 virus originated from avian h9n2 virus furthermore h9n2 and h5n1 viruses both induced prominent cytokine and chemokine activation in human macrophages and epithelial cells compared with that induced by seasonal influenza a h1n1 virus20 in previous studies treatment with convalescent plasma or hyperimmune  globulin seemed to improve survival of patients and therefore hyperimmune  globulin should be considered in the treatment of severe h7n9 infection21 immunomodulatory agents such as celecoxib but not corticosteroids improve outcomes of h5n1 infections in mice22
 other host factors such as smoking and obesity are risk factors for severe influenza23 24 findings from murine models challenged with influenza viruses suggest that smoking worsens the response of proinflammatory chemokine and cytokines and histological changes of inflammatory infiltrates and lung damage increases viral titres and impairs pulmonary adaptive t-lymphocyte responses to the virus25
 rapid virological diagnosis was established by rt-pcr of the m h7 and n9 genes and confirmed by viral culture in cell lines similar to h5n1 infection which mainly affected the lower respiratory tract sputum and endotracheal aspirates might be better than nasopharyngeal and throat swabs for detection of influenza a h7n91 the predilection of influenza a h7n9 for the lower respiratory tract suggests that the virus might replicate more efficiently there where both -23-linked and -26-linked sialic acid receptors are noted1 -23-linked sialic acid was detected on non-ciliated cuboidal bronchiolar cells at the junction between the respiratory bronchiole and alveolus a substantial number of cells lining the alveolar wall also expressed this receptor the emergence of a new reassortant avian h7n9 virus causing human infections without preceding or concomitant outbreak in poultry was quite unexpected this occurrence could be attributed to the absence of the multibasic aminoacid motif at the proteolytic cleavage site of h which is associated with broad tissue tropism and organ dissemination and is therefore a key virulence marker of h5 or h7 subtypes of highly pathogenic avian influenza1 this multibasic cleavage site is a virulence marker in birds but is not confirmed as a virulence marker in people no pandemic virus has had this multibasic aminoacid motif wild waterfowl such as ducks and geese were the original natural reservoir for h116 n1926 and provide new genes for making new virus reassortants that then infect domestic poultry such as chickens ducks and geese which are in close contact with human beings further adaptive genetic changes of such viruses in domestic poultry can enable transmission to people the key concerns about the current outbreak of influenza a h7n9 virus are how the virus crosses the species barrier and whether it will further adapt to enable efficient person-to-person transmission sequence analysis showed that the human h7 had aminoacid substitutions associated with increased affinity for the human -26-linked sialic acid receptor27 however binding to the -23-linked sialic acid receptor is likely to be retained allowing the virus to circulate in poultry and infect human lower-respiratory-tract mucosae which contain both types of receptor1
 shortening of the n stalk region of h5n1 viruses enhanced adaptation to land-based poultry28 an important virus protein pb2 in combination with two other viral proteins pb1 and pa comprise the viral rna polymerase complex pb2 is an important determinant of the host range and virulence of influenza viruses two aminoacids in pb2 627lys and 701asn have previously been detected in h5n1 viruses isolated from people18 coupled 627lys701asp or 627glu701asn substitutions were thought to be important for efficient transmission29 although we did not note glu627lys substitution in pb2 in our human isolate we did record asp701asn substitution another study14 of the current h7n9 outbreak detailed three cases of infection in shanghai and anhui china the viral isolates showed glu627lys mutation we noted neither genetic signature for mammalian adaptationie gln226leu and asp701asnin the chicken isolate which suggests that this genetic adaptation might have occurred after the virus jumped from the chicken to the patient ser31asn mutation associated with adamantane resistance was noted but neuraminidase inhibitors including oseltamivir zanamivir and peramivir should still be active if given early in the course of illness one patient did not receive any antivirals and three patients received oseltamivir more than 5 days after onset of symptoms we do not know whether oseltamivir resistance will emerge as was the case with the h5n1 virus because the last h7n9-positive sample from patient 2 was not tested for oseltamivir resistance after 5 days of oseltamivir treatment delayed initiation of oseltamivir treatment and use of corticosteroids have been associated with slow decreases in viral load and poor outcomes23
 in 2003 an h7n7 virus which contained the multibasic aminoacid motif associated with virulence and the genetic marker for mammalian adaptation glu627lys caused one fatal infection in the netherlands4 other severe human infections with the h7 subtype had not been reported before the current h7n9 outbreak previous surveillance studies have shown the h7n3 virus to be present in domestic ducks in zhejiang30 avian h7 subtype viruses are likely to have become established in domestic poultry in zhejiang interaction between newly established h7 subtypes and other avian influenza viruses such as the h9n2 subtype might have resulted in the current h7n9 strain which has gained some ability to infect human beings further adaptation could lead to less symptomatic infection and more efficient person-to-person transmission aggressive intervention to block further animal-to-person transmission in live poultry markets as has previously been done in hong kong should be considered temporary closure of live bird markets and comprehensive programmes of surveillance culling improved biosecurity segregation of different poultry species and possibly vaccination programmes to control h7n9 virus infection in poultry seem necessary to halt evolution of the virus into a pandemic agent  multiplex pcr tests sentinel the appearance of pandemic influenza viruses including h1n1 swine influenza james mahony b todd hatchette davor ojkic steven drews j jonathan gubbay donald low e martin petric patrick tang sylvia chong kathy luinstra astrid petrich marek smieja   the current outbreak of swine influenza that originated in mexico in march 2009 has spread to 39 countries in one month causing 8480 cases globally with 66 deaths as of may 171 the 2009 swine flu virus designated h1n1 aswinecalifornia042009 is not zoonotic swine flu and is not transmitted from pigs to humans but rather from person to person in humans h1n1 swine flu presents as an influenza-like illness ili with symptoms similar to those of seasonal influenza viz namely chills fever sore throat muscle pains severe headache coughing weakness and general discomfort2 since these symptoms are not specific to swine flu early in the pandemic physicians were advised to consider swine influenza in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute febrile respiratory illness who had returned from mexico or been in contact with persons with confirmed swine flu however this epidemiological link will require modification3 this new strain of h1n1 swine influenza appears to be a result of reassortment of two swine influenza viruses one from north america and one from europe with the north american virus itself the product of previous reassortments carrying an avian pb2 gene for at least 10 years and a human pb1 gene since 1993 the hemagglutinin ha gene is similar to that of swine flu viruses present in united states pigs since 1999 while neuraminidase na and matrix m genes resemble viruses present in european pigs viruses with this genetic makeup have not previously been found in humans or pigs although there is no formal national surveillance system to identify what viruses are circulating in pigs in north america the genetic makeup of this virus is germaine to the design of molecular tests for diagnosis multiplex pcr testing for the detection of respiratory viruses has seen major advances over the past decade resulting in the development of several commercially available tests4 these tests can amplify one or more genes from a number of respiratory viruses and detect amplified products using microgene arrays one test the xtag rvp test was developed to detect 20 different virus types and subtypes in a single test using multiplex rt-pcr and detection with a microfluidic array on the luminex 100 instrument5 the xtag rvp test was developed in 2005 immediately following sars and h5n1 influenza and was designed to detect and type the three influenza a subtypes circulating at that time viz h1 h3 and h5 understanding how the xtag rvp test identifies influenza a is important to its detection of new non-seasonal influenza viruses the test amplifies a conserved part of the matrix gene found in all influenza a viruses and specific regions of the h1 or h3 genes6 the test therefore simultaneously detects influenza a and determines the h1 or h3 subtype since all seasonal influenza viruses in man over the past 20 years prior to h5n1 in 2003 and swine influenza in 2009 have been either h1 or h3 the rvp test can effectively detect the presence of non-seasonal non-h1 non-h3 virus by virtue of a positive matrix gene signal and negative h1 and h3 signals a combination of results that flag a new influenza subtype and potential pandemic threat the objective of the study was to demonstrate that the use of multiplex pcr tests such as the xtag rvp test that use a combination of matrix and hemagglutinin gene targets can detect novel non-seasonal strains of influenza the study was a laboratory based study using specimens from newly diagnosed h1n1 swine flu human cases and avian swine and equine isolates of influenza a the introduction of h1n1 swine flu this year provided a real life challenge for the rvp assay the rvp test results for 20 confirmed cases of h1n1 swine influenza in four canadian cities in three provinces nova scotia ontario and british columbia are shown in table 1
 all 20 individuals who presented with ili had either recently returned from mexico or had an epidemiologic link to travelers to mexico and were confirmed as positive for h1n1 aswinecalifornia042009 by either the national microbiology laboratory in winnipeg the ontario agency for health prevention and promotion in toronto or the bccdc in vancouver using a combination of real time matrix gene pcr real time pcr targeting the aswinecalifornia042009 ha gene or by sequencing the ha gene matrix gene signals for all 20 patients were positive mean signal was 6970 mfi while the h1 and h3 signals were negative indicating the presence of a non-seasonal non-h1 non-h3 influenza a virus to further validate the ability of the rvp test to identify non-h1 non-h3 influenza viruses we tested 17 influenza a viruses representing 11 of the 16 ha subtypes and four untyped isolates the influenza subtypes tested included both high pathogenicity and low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses isolated from four bird species turkey quail mallard chicken in five countries canada italy england usa and vietnam four swine and two equine viruses the results show that all 17 viruses had a positive matrix signal mean 7692 and negative signals for both h1 and h3 genes table 2
 for comparison one h1 and two h3 seasonal influenza specimens gave readings of 8716 1566 and 3255 for the h1 and h3 targets respectively the rvp test also correctly flagged two h5n1 isolates as h5 subtypes using unmasked software these results indicate that the rvp test can distinguish between seasonal h1 h3 influenza and non-h1 non-h3 non-seasonal avian or animal influenza the emergence of h1n1 swine influenza has provided a real life challenge for the rvp test to detect new pandemic strains the xtag rvp successfully flagged 20 out of 20 swine flu patients as having non-seasonal influenza while at the same time correctly identified seasonal influenza 8 h1n1 and 14 h3n2 3 parainfluenza type 3 6 rhinoenterovirus 2 coronavirus 229e and 1 metapneumovirus infections in hamilton during the month of april by running the test daily as a sentinel test we have been able to provide public health authorities with a probable swine flu result with a 24 h turn around time faster than that provided by our public health laboratories while laboratories rush to build h1n1 swine flu specific assays currently available molecular tests such as the xtag rvp assay provide a solution for detecting swine flu cases in the absence of specific h1n1 swine flu tests we believe that the rvp test if implemented in diagnostic algorithms can play an important role as a sentinel test to detect novel non-seasonal influenza a viruses in patients presenting with ili and therefore act as an early warning system for the detection of future pandemic influenza threats all authors have agreed to the content of the manuscript and its submission to the journal jbm is an inventor on a patent relating to the xtag rvp test all authors declare that the content of the manuscript is original and has not been published or submitted for publication to another journal  from aiv to zikv attacks from emerging and re-emerging pathogens george gao f   this year marks the centenary of the spanish flu pandemic the most devastating viral pandemic in history caused by an h1n1 influenza a virus that infected over 500 million and killed between 50 and 100 million people we know to expect a flu season every year the question is always how severe it will be with high numbers of influenza infections reported worldwide during this season we are again reminded of the public health threat stemming from a potential influenza pandemic the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc reported that this is the first time in the past 15 years that all states in the entire continental usa have reported widespread flu activity during the same week in china the reported number of flu cases have increased over 2-fold compared to the flu seasons in the past several yearsthe second-highest recorded number just after the 2009 pandemic h1n1 ph1n1and many patients have been hospitalized with severe clinical symptoms these events have raised concerns that we are in danger of another flu pandemic circulating flu viruses are quite diverse this yearincluding the swine flu 2009-ph1n1 h3n2 and influenza bvictoria and byamagataand are spread across various geographical locations the h3n2 subtype is dominant in the uk and the usa but a mixed pool of ph1n1 h3n2 and influenza byamagata with a small portion of bvictoria have been reported in china a universal influenza vaccine to combat such mutation-prone viruses is urgently needed yet still far from reach despite the global efforts despite best efforts to anticipate the emergent strains vaccines vary from year to year in terms of efficacy with this years providing only moderate protection human infections with different subtypes of avian influenza a viruses aivs have been consistently reported since h5n1 aiv was reported in hong kong during 1997 yuen et al 1998 infections with aiv typically result in high case fatality rates cfrs ranging from 30 to 70 and at least 14 influenza a virus subtypesincluding the three seasonal flu viruses h1n1 h2n2 and h3n2have reportedly infected humans to date figure 1
 of note influenza a virus has a segmented genome with 8 genomic segments encoding at least 1016 proteins two of which are hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na there are currently 16 2 ha genes and 9 2 na genes 2 means two more ha or na from bat-derived influenza-like viruses for which only genomic sequences are available but no alive virus has yet been isolated wu et al 2014 the combination of ha and na would theoretically yield 144 subtypes of hxny viruses due to the migratory birds travel and live poultry trade which includes the transport of poultry and operation of live poultry markets lpms throughout china and southeast asia gao 2014 we should expect more human infections with aivs in the future aivs may supply genomic segments for reassortment with circulating seasonal influenza viruses to generate a novel pathogen with high cfr and pandemic potential as we cant yet eradicate seasonal flu efforts to change the traditional live poultry tradefor example the traditional lpmsin order to restrict the flow of domestic poultry migration may help decrease the probability of the emergence of novel aiv subtypes even the potential pandemic viruses flu isnt alone coronavirus is another family of emerging pathogens with public health concern a devastating but quickly conquered outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov during 2003 transformed chinas approach to outbreak control a sophisticated surveillance system has since been put into place while primarily government led there is extensive collaboration with various institutes in the academic industry and healthcare fields to produce a wide-ranging comprehensive network that issues warnings of an impending outbreak at the earliest opportunity as exemplified by the chinese academy of sciences center for influenza research and early-warning cascire network in addition to chinese national influenza centerwho collaborating center for reference and research on influenza under china cdc such a system can drive basic applied and translational research on infectious disease control and prevention bi et al 2017 a related coronavirus the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov emerged in the middle east during 2012 and has on occasion caused sporadic infections with imported cases from returning travelers some of which go on to infect others one such instance was the importation of a mers-cov case into china from south korea during 2015 su et al 2015 in which the traveler was promptly identified and quarantined preventing further infections due to the ongoing nature of the mers-cov outbreak we are likely to encounter more coronavirus infections in the future preparations should be made accordingly through the development of both vaccines and antivirals ebola virus ebov first identified in central africa during 1976 unexpectedly struck west africa during 20132015 impacting several countries in north america europe and africa after earlier incidents efforts were underway to develop vaccine candidates however these were challenged as the virus was at first suspected to have a higher mutation rate that might negatively impact the efficacy of the ebov vaccine candidates under clinical trials gire et al 2014 to address this question directly a total of 175 whole-genome sequences were obtained from viral isolates and the mutation rate was determined to be similar to that of past ebov outbreaks tong et al 2015 therefore current experimental vaccines should still be efficacious during this epidemic application of genomic sequencing technology greatly facilitated disease control molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis studies in addition to the development of effective antivirals such as the zmapp antibody cocktail and the vesicular-stomatitis-virus vsv- and adenovirus ad5 chad3-based vaccines were the key measures for the effective control of these pathogens while the world was still celebrating the success of finally conquering ebov after a protracted 2-year battle zika virus zikv struck with the first cases reported in brazil after small outbreaks previously reported in micronesia yap island and french polynesia in 2007 and 2013 respectively figure 2
 as an obscure pathogen but known to humans since 1947 the zikv isolates from the 20152016 epidemic were found to possess new characteristics grubaugh et al 2018 the virus quickly spread geographically with at least 84 countriesregions affected figure 2 a coordinated global response eventually led to the conclusion of the epidemic in november 2016 but long-term complications stemming from zikv infections are yet being reported from convalescent patients after the zikv epidemic outbreaks of yellow fever virus yfv occurred across angola and brazil in 2017 the virus was imported to china as chinese workers returned from angola chen et al 2016 almost simultaneously rift valley fever virus rvfv was also imported into china from angola through a returning traveler these events highlighted the difficulty in accurately predicting the time and location as well as the identity of the causative pathogen behind the next outbreak indeed ebov and zikv were both considered neglected tropical re-emerging pathogens sars-cov and mers-cov were novel emerging pathogens and influenza viruses were typically re-emerging pathogens with new properties derived from genetic evolution and reassortments a myriad of contributing factors such as urbanization globalization and climate change will impact the pathogenicity and transmission of certain pathogens as well as the distribution of their reservoir hosts this reality places additional emphasis on the importance of proactive countermeasures such as pathogen surveillance and vaccine development as well as the need for reactive countermeasures such as antiviral therapy as a community of scientists clinicians public health experts and caregivers we have so far been able to answer the challenges posed by a spectrum of pathogens ranging from avian influenza virus to zika virus each has taken time and a somewhat tailored approach we can expect sterner tests in the future and some of the lessons learned must be carried forward since the spread of re-emerging viruses is not confined by geographic boundaries it is clear that collaborative solutions across nations are needed to solve these global problems efforts in this vein are getting off the ground international partnerships such as the global virome project carroll et al 2018 for virus hunting worldwide and the establishment of a cdc network in africa with assistance from the us cdc and china cdc will greatly improve our capacity for surveillance contributing to ideally a worldwide system in the big data era of the 21st century the pandemic emergency financing facility pef launched by the world bank in collaboration with the world health organization and the governments of japan and germany aims to provide over 500 million to cover developing countries against the risk of outbreaks the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi founded by the norway government the bill  melinda gates foundation the wellcome trust and the world economic forum aim to provide a coordinated bench-to-bedside approach for pre-clinical vaccine development and delivery the above examples show that we are beginning to learn our lessons but we must not forget that basic scientific research into both high-profile and obscure pathogens forms a crucial basis for the effective implementation of informed public health policies and innovative collaborative initiatives robust investment into basic research ie viral pathogenesis interspecies transmission etc should be encouraged to achieve a fully multi-faceted approach to combating future pandemics  pedv enters cells through clathrin- caveolae- and lipid raft-mediated endocytosis and traffics via the endo-lysosome pathway xiaona wei gaoli she tingting wu chunyi xue yongchang cao   as a type of alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv has caused enormous economic loss to the global pork industry especially after the emergence of highly pathogenic pedv variant strains in 2010 pedv was first reported in 1971 in the uk 1 and afterward was also discovered in europe and asia 25 although pedv has persisted in asian swine-producing countries it does not attract enough global attention after october 2010 severe ped outbreaks occurred even in chinese pig farms that were already vaccinated with cv777-inactivated or live-attenuated vaccines 2 68 in 2013 the first pedv outbreak occurred in the us and rapidly spread across the entire country 9 molecular epidemiological results show the genetic differences between classical gi subtype and new pedv variant strains gii subtype 2 3 5 6 8 9 pedv is presently recognized worldwide due to dramatic changes observed in its epidemic character pathogenic properties and gene drift 10 studies focused on its pathogenesis 11 12 immune evasion 13 and developing effective vaccines 14 15 are progressing a virus is a non-cellular life form that must rely on cells to complete its life cycle the first step in virus infection is successful entry into cells most enveloped viruses enter cells through cellular endocytosis 16 17 the endocytic pathways utilized by viruses vary including clathrin-mediated endocytosis cme caveolae-mediated endocytosis lipid raft-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis among others cme is the most classical and well-known endocytic pathway utilized by viruses after binding to cell surface receptors the virus is packaged by clathrin-coated pits ccps and transported to clathrin-coated vesicles ccvs in which virus particles as the cargo will be transported to the early endosomes 18 19 caveolae is a plasma-specific invagination structure with a diameter of 50100 nm when viral particles interact with receptors caveolae coated with caveolin-1 invaginates and pinches off plasma membrane then the caveolae vesicles mature into caveosomes and deliver cargoes to early endosomes 20 21 lipid raft are plasma membrane microdomains enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol that participate in the lateral organization of the cell surface raft-mediated endocytosis is the process of internalization of ligands and receptors by these domains 22 the mechanisms of some coronaviruses entry into cells have already been studied such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov murine hepatitis virus mhv and human coronavirus hcovs entry of sars-cov into hepg2 and cos7 cells is clathrin-dependent while entry into vero e6 cells is clathrin- and caveolae-independent 23 24 but the lipid raft plays an important role in the process 25 mhv entry into cells needs clathrin 2628 the same as hcov-nl63 29 for hcov-229e caveolae-mediated endocytosis is utilized to enter human fibroblast cells 30 sars-cov and mhv-cov can induce continuous micropinocytosis but this occurs in the later phase during infection and is not associated with virus entry 31 coronaviruses enter host cells via various endocytic pathways after viral spike glycoprotein s interacts with receptors and then initiates the endocytic process internalized viruses are trafficked like cargoes to membrane fusion sites through specific transport routes different covs have varying fusion sites 32 the fusion site of the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov takes place in the early endosome while mhv and the feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv are transported to the lysosome to fuse although there have been many studies on the invasion mechanism of cov the invasion strategy of pedv has not yet been fully elucidated in 2014 park et al 33 revealed that pedv entry followed clathrin-mediated endocytosis and was dependent on a low ph for successful entry into cells in their research one pedv strain was studied in vero cells in the presence of trypsin and only the chemical inhibitors and confocal method were used to reveal the pedv entry however there are still important questions to address considering that covs take advantage of different pathways to enter cells whether different subtypes of pedv invade cells by different ways and whether pedv enter different types of cells through different ways remains to be determined to concretely clarify the entry and transportation routes of pedv we used vero and ipec-j2 cells as models for pedv entry and chose cv777-like strain gds09 and highly pathogenic variant strain gds01 to compare the invasion

independent experiments significance was estimated using one-way anova with multiple comparisons to control p values less than 005 were defined as the threshold for statistical significance p values between 005 and 001 were marked with one asterisk p values between 001 and 0001 were marked with two asterisks p values between 0001 and 00001 were marked with three asterisks and p values less than 00001 were marked with four asterisks coronavirus entry is inextricably linked with proteolytic processing of the s protein in most cases pedv is trypsin dependent thus we investigated the trypsin dependency of both strains used in our research as shown in figure 1a gds01 strain needed trypsin while gds09 strain is trypsin independent so we added trypsin in the following assays to explore the invasion mechanism of pedv the dynamics of viruses invading different kinds of cells vary and there may be differences among various subtypes of the same virus thus it is necessary to know the entry dynamics of pedv before studying the endocytic pathways the cells were incubated with pedv at moi  05 at 4 c for adsorption and shifted to 37 c to initiate internalization the adsorbed but not internalized virions were removed with proteinase k and the pedv invasion rates at different time points were detected using qrt-pcr the invasion kinetics figure 1 showed that most of the pedv particles were detached from the cells by proteinase k at the beginning of invasion after 60 min in the vero cells figure 1b and 45 min in the ipec-j2 cells figure 1c nearly maximum proportions of viral particles completed the internalization approximately 95 of the pedv particles entered the vero cells while only 30 entered the ipec-j2 cells notably the gds01 strain demonstrated less efficient invasion than the gds09 strain but there was no significant difference dynamin ii plays an essential role in cellular membrane fusion during vesicle formation due to its gtpase activity and it is necessary for clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis 35 37 thus we explored the essentiality of dynamin ii in pedv entry using specific chemical inhibitors overexpression of domain-negative mutants of dynamin ii and sirna interference dynasore 38 a cell-permeable non-competitive inhibitor of dynamin ii was used to pre-treat cells at different concentrations to analyze the effect on pedv entry the cytotoxicity test showed that 50 m of dynasore had no effect on the viability of the vero and ipec-j2 cells additional file 1 cells were pre-treated with 30 m and 50 m dynasore for 1 h before pedv infection dmso was used as a negative control the effect of dynasore on pedv entry was quantified by qrt-pcr at 6 hpi pedv invasion was significantly inhibited by dynasore at a concentration of 50 m the invasion rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains into the vero cells were approximately 17 and 12 and the invasion rates into the ipec-j2 cells were 8 and 63 respectively figure 2a a comparison of the invasion rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains indicated that the gds01 strain was more sensitive to dynasore than the gds09 strain when invading the ipec-j2 cells but there was no significant difference between them when invading the vero cells many studies used the overexpression of dominant negative mutants to explore the role of dynamin ii in virus entry 39 40 mutation of dynamin ii from 44k to 44a can inhibit gtpase activity and reduce endocytosis 41 cells were transfected with wild-type and mutant types of dynamin ii respectively and infected with gds01 and gds09 strains at 24 h after transfection the confocal results showed that the vero and ipec-j2 cells overexpressing wild-type dynamin ii gfp-dyn-wt were infected with pedv while the cells overexpressing mutant dynamin ii gfp-dyn-m were barely infected figure 2b sirna interference was also used to identify the importance of dynamin ii on virus entry 23 35 42 sus scrofa and chlorocebus sabaeus sirnas of dynamin ii sidyn were designed and synthesized the interference efficiency of sirna on the dynamin ii expression in the vero and ipec-j2 cells was obvious at both the mrna and protein levels additional file 1 cells were infected with pedv after transfection twice and the internalized virions were quantified at 6 hpi and 9 hpi by qrt-pcr and western blotting assay respectively the qrt-pcr results figure 2c showed that the knockdown of dynamin ii expression reduced the pedv internalization the internalization rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains into vero cells were approximately 50 and 57 the internalization rates into the ipec-j2 cells were approximately 48 and 60 respectively but there was no significant difference between the gds01 and gds09 strains in the two cells figure 2c the same results were confirmed by western blotting figure 2d taken together the results suggested that pedv entry relies on dynamin ii clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the most commonly used and classical endocytic pathway for virus entry to identify whether pedv utilized cme to enter cells we co-inoculated the vero and ipec-j2 cells with pedv and trf which is the most typical biomolecule that uses cme to enter cells 43 the co-inoculation results showed that pedv co-located with trf in the two types of cells figure 3a which means that pedv might utilize clathrin-mediated endocytosis to enter cells to prove this conjecture we used specific chemical inhibition the overexpression of domain negative mutants of eps 15 the knockdown expression of chc and eps 15 by sirna and the location of pedv in the cells to estimate the role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in pedv entry cpz is a specific chemical inhibitor used to block the cme pathway by preventing the assembly of ccps at the plasma membrane 44 the cytotoxicity test showed that 30 m cpz have no effect on the viability of the vero cells and 50 m cpz have no effect on the viability of the ipec-j2 cells additional file 2 vero and ipec-j2 cells were treated with cpz at different concentrations for 1 h and then infected with pedv the internalization rates of pedv after cpz treatment were quantified by qrt-pcr and western blotting at 6 hpi and 9 hpi respectively the qrt-pcr results figure 3b showed that pedv invasion was significantly inhibited by cpz the invasion rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains at the highest drug concentrations were nearly 48 and 23 in the vero cells and 24 and 50 in the ipec-j2 cells respectively notably there were no significant differences between the gds01 and gds09 strains in the vero cells but the gds01 strain was more sensitive than the gds09 strain in the ipec-j2 cells reflecting the gds01 strains significantly decreased invasion rates figure 3b the same results were also observed by western blotting figure 3c and ifa assay additional files 3 4 the role of cme in endocytosis was also identified by the overexpression of gfp-tagged dominant negative mutants of eps 15 45 eps 15 is a critical component of ccps by interacting with adaptor protein 2 ap-2 a major clathrin adaptor complex 46 cells transfected with wild-type gfp-eps15-wt and mutant eps 15 gfp-eps15-m were infected with pedv strains at 24 h after transfection the confocal results of the pedv invasion showed that the cells overexpressing wild-type eps 15 were infected with pedv while few infections were observed in the overexpressed gfp-eps15-m cells figure 3d sirna was also used to explore the role of cme in pedv entry by interfering with the expression of clathrin heavy chain chc and eps 15 chc and clathrin light chain form a triskelion shape which is a key component for regulating the formation and disassembly of the clathrin lattice 47 cells were infected with pedv strains after transfection twice and the invasion rates of the viruses were assessed using qrt-pcr and western blotting assay at 6 hpi and 9 hpi respectively the quantitative experiments showed that knockdown of the expression of chc significantly reduced the invasion rates of pedv the invasion rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains were 50 and 62 in the vero cells and 61 and 65 in the ipec-j2 cells respectively and there was no significant difference between the gds01 and gds09 strains figure 3e knockdown of the expression of eps 15 also significantly reduced the invasion rates of pedv the invasion rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains were 61 and 65 in the vero cells and 51 and 66 in the ipec-j2 cells respectively and there was no significant difference between the gds01 and gds09 strains figure 3g the significant inhibition of sichc and sieps15 on pedv entry was also observed by western blotting assay figures 3f h to estimate whether pedv directly entered the cells through cme we analyzed the localization of pedv and chc in the vero and ipec-j2 cells respectively pre-cooled cells were incubated with pedv at 4 c for 1 h for adsorption and shifted to 37 c for internalization five min later the cells were washed and fixed for observation using an ultrahigh-resolution laser confocal microscope the confocal results showed that pedv particles co-located with chc protein in the vero and ipec-j2 cells figure 3i but some virions were not co-localized with chc the results indicated that pedv can enter cells through the cme pathway but cme may not be the only pathway utilized by pedv cholesterol an important component of cell membranes embeds phospholipid bilayers and plays a crucial role in the fluidity of cell membranes 48 many studies showed that most enveloped virus relied on cholesterol to invade cells 49 50 if a virus invades cells depending on the presence of cholesterol it will be sensitive to cholesterol extractants mcd can eliminate cholesterol on the plasma membrane of cells 51 nystatin can bind to the cholesterol-enriched regions of cell membrane and then decompose cholesterol and impair cholesterol synthesis 52 the cytotoxicity test showed that the maximum tolerance concentrations of vero and ipec-j2 cells to mcd were 3 mm and 15 mm respectively and the maximum tolerance concentrations to nystatin were 30 m and 50 m respectively additional file 5 cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of mcd and nystatin for 1 h then infected with pedv the effects of drugs on pedv entry were estimated by qrt-pcr and western blotting at 6 hpi and 9 hpi respectively mcd showed a significant inhibition of pedv entry the internalization rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains after mcd treatment were approximately 4 and 6 in the vero cells and approximately 5 and 35 in the ipec-j2 cells there were no significant differences between the gds01 and gds09 strains in the mcd-treated vero cells but in the ipec-j2 cells the gds01 strain was more sensitive to mcd figure 4a the results were confirmed by western blotting figure 4b and ifa assay additional files 3 and 4 pedv entry was significantly inhibited by nystatin treatment the internalization rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains after nystatin treatment were approximately 75 and 25 in the vero cells and approximately 65 and 45 in the ipec-j2 cells the gds09 strain was more sensitive to nystatin than the gds01 strain in both the vero and ipec-j2 cells figure 4c the same results were confirmed by western blotting figure 4d and ifa assay additional files 3 and 4 to further evaluate the importance of cholesterol cells pre-treated with mcd were supplemented with exogenous cholesterol and then infected with pedv and the changes in the viral invasion rates were quantified by qrt-pcr at 6 hpi the results showed that adding exogenous cholesterol could significantly increase the invasion rate of pedv the average invasion rate of the gds01 and gds09 strains increased from 10 to over 90 in the vero cells and from 10 and 50 to approximately 95 in the ipec-j2 cells figure 4e the results indicated that pedv invading and entering cells depended on cholesterol but the two pedv subtypes showed different degrees of dependence on cholesterol when entering the vero and ipec-j2 cells as both caveolae and lipid raft are rich in cholesterol they are sensitive to cholesterol inhibitors 53 54 to identify whether caveolae-mediated endocytosis was involved in pedv entry cells were co-inoculated with pedv and ctb which entered the cells after interactions with specific receptors 55 the localization results showed that pedv co-localized with ctb in vero and ipec-j2 cells figure 5a which means pedv may utilize caveolae-mediated endocytosis to enter cells as the caveolae is mainly coated with caveolin-1 56 knocking down the expression and separating the interaction factors with caveolin-1 blocked the caveolae-mediated endocytic pathway overexpression of the domain-negative mutant of caveolin-1 57 blocked its interaction with the interaction factors cells were transfected with wild-type caveolin-1 gfp-cav-wt and mutant caveolin-1 gfp-cav-m then infected with pedv at 24 h after transfection and fixed for confocal observation at 12 hpi the results showed that pedv infected gfp-cav-wt-overexpressing cells but barely infected gfp-cav-m-overexpressing vero or ipec-j2 cells figure 5b sirnas sicav were designed and synthetized to knockdown caveolin-1 expression cells were transfected with sicav twice and then infected with pedv after the second transfection the invasion rates of pedv were measured by qrt-pcr and western blotting at 6 hpi and 9 hpi respectively the qrt-pcr results showed that the knockdown of caveolin-1 expression reduced the internalization of pedv the inhibition rates in the gds01 and gds09 strains were 53 and 32 in the vero cells and 33 and 40 in the ipec-j2 cells respectively figure 5c compared with the gds09 strain the gds01 strain showed a higher degree of reduction in the invasion rate in the vero cells but there was no significant difference in the ipec-j2 cells figure 5c the same results were confirmed by western blotting assay figure 5d to identify the role of caveolae in pedv entry we investigated the cellular localization of pedv with caveolin-1 pre-cooled cells were incubated with pedv at 4 c and then shifted to 37 c for internalization the cells were then washed and fixed for 10 min for observation with an ultrahigh-resolution laser confocal microscope the cellular localization results showed that pedv was co-located with caveolin-1 in the vero and ipec-j2 cells figure 5e pedv can enter cells through the caveolae-mediated pathway if pedv can enter cells through the lipid raft pathway the viral components should be contained in lipid raft enrichment layer after isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation 58 after incubation with pedv the cells were lysed and subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation the products were extracted from the top down and a total of 12 fractions were obtained for western blotting analysis caveolin-1 was used as the protein marker representing the lipid raft layer 58 the results showed that pedv could be detected in the upper lipid raft enrichment layer almost all the virions were concentrated in the lipid raft enrichment layer in the vero cells figure 6a and virions were detected in both the upper and lower components in the ipec-j2 cells figure 6b the differences between the gds01 and gds09 strains were the proportion of virions in the upper and lower components in the ipec-j2 cells the gds01 particles were mainly present in the upper layer while amounts of gds09 particles were present in the lower layer figure 6b the results indicated that pedv utilized lipid rafts to enter cells viruses that enter cells via endocytosis are usually trafficked by endocytic vesicles to early endosomes for sorting and are transported to late endosomes or fused with early endosomes 59 if viruses do not fuse in the early endosomes and release genomes into the cytoplasm they will enter the late endosomes with the further acidification and maturation of the early endosomes similarly if the ph environment in the late endosomes does not meet the requirements for conformational changes of viral glycoproteins to cause membrane fusion viruses will enter the lysosomes with the transportation of the late endosomes and finally achieve membrane fusion viruses require acidic ph to traffic between endosomes therefore it is necessary to clarify whether pedv relies on a low ph environment nh4cl is an inhibitor of endosome acidification 60 baf a1 is a v-atpase inhibitor that can block the traffic of endocytic cargoes from early endosomes to late endosomes and inhibit the stability of low ph environments in the lysosome lumen 61 cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of nh4cl and baf a1 additional file 6 and infected with pedv additional file 4 the invasion rates of pedv were measured by qrt-pcr and western blotting at 6 hpi and 9 hpi respectively the results showed that cells pre-treated with nh4cl significantly inhibited pedv entry the invasion rates in the gds01 and gds09 strains were approximately 30 and 15 in the vero cells and 50 and 73 in the ipec-j2 cells figure 7a this significant inhibition was also confirmed by western blotting figure 7b and ifa assay additional files 3 and 4 baf a1 can significantly inhibit pedv entry the invasion rates in the gds01 and gds09 strains were approximately 75 and 5 in the vero cells and 41 and 30 in the ipec-j2 cells figure 7c western blotting figure 7d and ifa assay additional files 3 4 also confirmed the inhibition of baf a1 the results proved that pedv entry requires low ph early endosomes mature into late endosomes by increasing intraluminal acidity through proton pump activity late endosomes can become larger vesicles by fusing with the same type of endosomes so they mostly exist in the form of a multivesicular body mvb late endosomes release rab5 incorporate rab7 and prepare to fuse with lysosomes 62 to explore whether pedv particles are trafficked after internalization we interfered with the expression of rab7 63 involved in late endosomes and vps39 32 involved in late endosome-to-lysosome maturation and identified whether viral particles co-located with early endosomes late endosomes and lysosomes knockdown of the expression of rab7 sirab7 can significantly inhibit the invasion efficiency of pedv the invasion rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains were 49 and 51 in the vero cells and 82 and 38 in the ipec-j2 cells figure 8a similarly the knockdown of the expression of vps39 sivps39 also significantly inhibited the invasion efficiency of pedv the invasion rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains were 68 and 56 in the vero cells and 45 and 50 in the ipec-j2 cells figure 8b for cellular location by pedv observation pre-cooled cells were incubated with pedv at 4 c and then shifted to 37 c for internalization the cells were washed and fixed at different time points after shift for observation using an ultrahigh-resolution laser confocal microscope cellular localization assays showed that internalized pedv could co-locate with eea1 the early endosome protein marker in the vero and ipec-j2 cells 30 min after endocytosis figure 8c and could co-locate with rab7 the late endosome protein marker 40 min after endocytosis figure 8d while the late endosomes were mostly in the form of mvb co-localization of pedv with lamp1 lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 an important lysosome membrane component was also observed 50 min after endocytosis in the two types of cells figure 8e the results demonstrated that pedv was trafficked to the lysosomes after entering the cells through endocytosis and there were no differences between the two pedv genotypes and cells since highly pathogenic variant strains emerged in 2010 pedv has attracted global attention many studies have reported that vaccines based on cv777 or cv777-like strains have low protection efficiency against re-emerging variant strains 3 4 68 genotyping showed that pedv strains can be sorted into two genotypes gi subtypes classical and gii subtypes variant the nucleotide sequence of s1 subunit of s protein is 7590 similar between gi and gii which shows high variability 10 64 as the main antigen of pedv the s protein plays an important role in inducing immune responses and viral entry mutation of the s gene may lead to different mechanisms of virus invasion which may help elucidate the pathogenesis and immune evasion of pedv as sars-cov utilizes varying endocytic routes to invade different cells 23 24 we wondered whether pedvs can enter cells through different pathways burkard et al clarified that coronavirus entered cells through the endosomelysosome pathway and was proteolytic dependent the furin cleavage site just upstream of the fusion peptide fp of the s protein was the key to determining the fusion site of the viral membrane 32 while the s protein of pedv does not have the furin cleavage site a conserved arginine just upstream of the putative fp as the potential cleavage site can be cleaved by trypsin 65 whether the theory mentioned above is applicable to pedv thus needs further study here we explored the gi and gii subtype pathways of pedv entry into vero and ipec-j2 cells respectively and the transportation route after internalization our results showed that two the subtypes of pedv utilized clathrin- caveolae- and lipid raft-mediated endocytosis to enter the vero and ipec-j2 cells but the utilization efficiency of each endocytic pathway varied depending on the different genotypes and types of cells to describe the dynamic curve of pedv entry the appropriate viral scavenger is extremely important to remove virus particles effectively adsorbed on the cell surface we compared the effects of citrate buffer ph 30 with proteinase k 1 mgml and the latter exhibited a stronger capacity to remove viruses the results of dynamic invasion showed that the virus invaded vero cells 100 within 60 min while the invasion efficiency of the ipec-j2 cells was only approximately 30 although ipec-j2 cells are considered the host cells of pedv the cell lines cultured in vitro lost their polar growth state in vivo 66 which possibly affects the viral recognition and reduces the infection efficiency of the virus gds01 showed a lower invasion rate than gds09 but there was no significant difference dynamin ii a gtpase plays an important role in endocytosis by pinching the endocytic vesicles off the plasma and is necessary in clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis we found that pedv entry is dynamin ii-dependent although the sensitivity of the gds01 and gds09 strains to dynasore varied considering the low specificity of chemistry inhibitor dominant negative mutant and sirna-mediated knockdown of dynamin ii were carried out to evaluate dynamin ii for pedv infection both the gds01 and gds09 strains were inhibited by sidynamin ii with no significant difference clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a classical and commonly used pathway for most enveloped viruses many coronaviruses use cme to enter cells such as sars-cov entry into hepg2 cells and cos7 cells and phev entry into neuro-2a cells 23 35 to ascertain whether pedv utilized cme to enter cells the chemistry inhibitor cpz was used to prevent clathrin assembly and further block cme clathrin is composed of light chain clc and heavy chain chc which form clathrin lattices under the interaction of ap-2 and eps 15 both cpz pre-treatment and sirna-mediated knockdown of chc and eps 15 can significantly reduce the invasion rate of pedv into cells with no significant difference between the gds01 and gds09 strains dominant negative mutants can provide a more specific method to study endocytic pathways by separating the prototype protein from their interaction regulatory factors in this study we also showed that cells overexpressing dominant negative mutant of eps 15 were barely infected with pedv but cells overexpressing wild-type eps 15 were infected as normal however the inhibition of endocytosis by overexpressing dominant negative mutants may be compensated through other clathrin-independent endocytic pathways when viruses enter cells through cme they are carried by clathrin-coated vesicles co-localization of viral particles and chc indicated that pedv entry relies on cme although caveolae and lipid rafts have the same components such as caveolin-1 gm1 and cholesterol they are two completely different endocytic pathways before investigating whether pedv can use these two pathways to enter cells we first examined whether pedv invasion depends on cholesterol the cholesterol inhibitors nystatin and mcd had significant inhibitory effects on pedv entry nystatin had higher inhibitory effects on gds09 entry than gds01 the inhibitory effects of mcd on vero cells were similar for gds09 and gds01 strains mcd effects were lower on gds09 than gds01 in ipec-j2 cells we hypothesized that gds01 cell invasion mainly depended on cholesterol on the cell surface while gds09 depended on the presence of cholesterol on the cell surface and cholesterol synthesis exogenous cholesterol supplementation also confirmed the importance of cholesterol in pedv entry endocytic vesicles formed in the caveolae-mediated pathway were coated with caveolin-1 which plays a critical role in the process dominant negative mutant rna interference and the cellular co-localization of caveolin-1 with viral particles provided further evidence that pedv entry needed caveolin-1 collectively both subtypes of pedv entered the vero and ipec-j2 cells through caveolae-mediated endocytosis however park et al 33 showed that pedv entry was independent of caveolae-coated pit assembly by treating vero cells with nystatin the different results may be explained by different operational details firstly nystatin was used before and during the incubation of pedv in this study while only before incubation in the research of park et al the concentrations of nystatin used in the two studies were different the highest concentration of nystatin used in parks research was 20 m 33 while the highest concentration we used was 30 m in vero cells when the concentration is 10 m nystatin does not inhibit the entry of pedv which is consistent with parks results secondly park et al added methyl cellulose to block second-cycle infection 33 while we added nothing except trypsin in medium whether these reasons cause two different results needs further study lipid raft acted as a platform for cell signal transduction and viral invasion distributed in an island form on the plasma membrane of cells and was isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation western blotting analysis showed that pedv n protein located in the lipid raft upper layer with caveolin-1 in the cells as shown in figure 6b pedv n protein is also present in the bottom layer when infected with ipec-j2 cells which may be due to the different composition of the plasma membranes of the two kinds of cells we demonstrated that pedv gi subtype gds09 and gii subtype gds01 strains could enter vero and ipec-j2 cells via the clathrin- caveolae- and lipid raft-mediated endocytosis pathways furthermore we also found that the invasion efficiency of the two strains was different with different endocytosis pathway these differences between gds01 and gds09 strains may be due to the difference of s gene especially the s1 region of s gene homology was about 92 which is responsible for cell entry and membrane fusion by binding with receptor the difference of gene may lead to the difference of binding ability or affinity between s protein and receptor thus leading to the different utilization or initiation efficiency of different endocytosis pathways however whether the different gene sequence causes different invasion efficiency between gds01 and gds09 strains needs further study after internalization viral particles are transported by specific endosomes for membrane fusion the classical transit route is the endo-lysosomal pathway in which endocytic cargoes are transported along endocytic vesicles early endosomes and late endosomes-lysosomes park et al have confirmed that nh4cl and baf-a1 could inhibit pedv entry 33 which is consistent with our results but needs to be confirmed by different methods in this study in addition to chemical inhibitors we also used sirna interference and cellular localization of virus particles to identify the role of ph and endosomes the results of this study revealed that pedv entry relied on low ph which means that internalized pedv particles are transported to endosomes and lysosomes as demonstrated by the co-localization of viral particles with eea1 rab7 and lamp1 liu et al 67 reported that pedv s protein was activated by lysosomal cysteine proteases to activate pedv entry however based on the data we could not conclude that membrane fusion occurred at the lysosomes more technical methods are necessary to demonstrate the mechanism in conclusion studying the internalization and intracellular trafficking mechanism of pedv are important to understand viral pathogenesis and benefit to the development of future therapies strategies this study demonstrated that both the gi and gii subtypes of pedv enter vero and ipec-j2 cells via the clathrin- caveolae- and lipid raft-mediated endocytosis pathways but the efficiency of each endocytosis pathway varies depending on the different genotypes and types of cells the internalized pedv entered the lysosomes through the early and late endosomes the results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the further understanding of pedv pathogenesis to find new targets of antiviral drugs  influenza virus like particles vlps opportunities for h7n9 vaccine development peter pushko irina tretyakova   in addition to pandemic covid-19 virus infections influenza virus remains a major threat to public health and causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide from annual seasonal epidemics and periodic pandemics 12 according to who seasonal influenza affects 510 of the global population annually and results in 3-5 million hospitalizations and about half a million deaths per year pandemic influenza a virus iav represents an even greater concern due to the rapid mutation rate of human iavs antigenically novel viruses are emerging periodically which are difficult to predict prevent or treat 3 zoonotic influenza viruses of h5n1 h9n2 and recently h7n9 and h10n8 subtypes have been identified as potentially pandemic 45 influenza viruses belong to the orthomyxoviridae family and comprise negative-sense single stranded segmented rna genome the rna genome segments are loosely encapsidated by the nucleoprotein into virus particle there are four types of influenza virustypes a b c and d influenza a viruses iav and type b viruses are clinically relevant for humans iav are further sub-divided based on the antigenic properties of surface glycoproteins into 18 hemagglutinin ha and 11 neuraminidase na subtypes only a few iav subtypes have been known to infect humans while the majority of them are harbored in their natural hosts such as waterfowl shorebirds and other species 6 cases of h7n9 human infections caused by an avian-origin h7n9 virus emerged in eastern china in march 2013 78 this novel virus has immediately raised pandemic concerns as historically pandemics were caused by the introduction of new subtypes into immunologically nave human populations 9 phylogenetic results indicate that novel h7n9 virus was a triple reassortant derived from avian influenza viruses 7 since 2013 surveillance of live poultry markets routinely detected h7n9 virus 10 human infections with h7n9 virus were associated mainly with the exposure to infected poultry 11 and were identified in many cities in china 12 both low pathogenicity avian influenza lpai and high pathogenicity avian influenza hpai h7n9 viruses have been recorded the first wave of h7n9 was associated with lpai virus and lasted from march until september 2013 the following four waves occurred annually until 2017 figure 1 during the fifth wave in the 201617 season the emergence of hpai h7n9 viruses was detected after no reported human cases of hpai h7n9 for over a year another hpai h7n9 case with severe disease was reported in mainland china in late march 2019 indicating the continuing public health threat from the h7n9 subtype 13 hpai subtype h5 and h7 proteins contain multiple basic amino acid cleavage sites between ha1 and ha2 domains within ha proteins which can be cleaved by furin-like proteases 14 in many host cells and organs that can lead to the efficient spread of the virus and severe disease in humans in contrast ha of lpai viruses does not have the furin cleavage site a fatality rate of up to 38 was reported for h7n9 viruses 16 which highlights the need for a safe and effective vaccine 17 several candidate h7n9 vaccine viruses have been prepared and listed by who table 1 these candidate vaccine viruses are available to vaccine developers for the preparation of h7n9 vaccine in the case of a pandemic the majority of current vaccine manufacturers prepare vaccines either as split subvirions or live-attenuated viruses and they are mostly dependent on fertilized chicken eggs as production bioreactors this technology is unlikely to meet the vaccine production demand during the rapid pandemic spread 18 scalability issues one vaccine doseegg the relatively long 6-month time period from strain isolation to final dose formulation and the requirement of biosecurity facilities for hpai are the major obstacles for egg-based production 19 in addition iav can acquire adaptive mutations when grown in eggs which can interfere with the vaccine performance and efficacy according to the action plan published by who in 2006 more than 234 billion monovalent vaccine doses will be needed in the case of a global pandemic which justifies the development of novel technologies capable of supporting surge demand for pandemic influenza vaccine within a short period of time 20 recently several new platform technologies including recombinant vlps have been developed in order to facilitate the scale-up of vaccine production including overcoming the drawbacks of the egg-based vaccine production method the first recombinant influenza vaccine flublok based on ha antigen has received fda approval 22 the surface envelope glycoproteins such as influenza ha and na generally are viewed as the primary targets for vaccine development ha currently represents the major target for vaccine development including approved and experimental vaccines 22 recombinant ha-based vaccines have been shown to be efficacious against influenza including h7n9 17232425262728293031 experimental na-based vaccines have been reported 3233 the induction of immune responses against the surface envelope proteins has advantages because virus-neutralizing antibody response to the viral envelope proteins can prevent early steps of viral infection human monoclonal antibodies targeting the ha glycoprotein can neutralize h7n9 influenza virus 34 importantly the neutralizing antibodies protected against ashanghai22013 h7n9 virus challenge 35 the novel recombinant vlp vaccine platforms included vlps prepared in mammalian insect and plant expression systems recombinant vlps are morphologically and biochemically similar to the wild type influenza virus figure 2 however they lack viral genetic material and are unable to replicate and cause infection table 2 shows examples of various vlps prepared from h7n9 virus antigens cell culture-based production of vlps can potentially overcome limitations of classic influenza vaccines 36 as vlps closely resemble viruses they contain immunological epitopes in the natural conformation are highly immunogenic but they are non-infectious because they are prepared in the absence of viral genomic rna segments each vlp represents a repetitive and highly organized molecular array of antigens displayed on the vlp surface vlps have been shown to be better immunogens than subunit vaccines because of their self-adjuvant properties 51 the antigens present in vlp bind pattern recognition receptors on innate immune effector cells and trigger the innate immunity of host cells 5253 the molecular arrays displayed on vlps surface are also potent inducers of type 2 t-independent b-cell response 54 cryo-electron microscopy of vlps from 1918 pandemic influenza virus demonstrated a uniform distribution of ha molecules on the surface of vlps along with prefusion state confirmation 55 two types of spike on the surface of virus are formed by trimers of ha and tetramers of na it has been estimated that a spherical influenza virion of average diameter 120 nm has 375 spikes 56 the recombinant platforms using either mammalian insect or plant cells have many potential advantages including scalability and intrinsic safety especially for hpai viruses such as h7n9 table 2 mammalian cells such as mdck vero and percc6 cell lines have been extensively studied and applied to influenza vaccine production the use of vlps expressed from mammalian cell platform has advantages for vlp production such as flexibility and a similar glycosylation pattern to the human virus in some reports vlps expressed from hek293t cells containing ha and na proteins on their surface with a hana ratio of 11 which is higher than natural influenza viruses where the hana ratio is 41 57 vlps isolated from hek293sf cells were also characterized by nano-lc-msms analysis to identify the protein cargo nucleolin was the most abundant cellular protein present in vlps in addition to the recombinant influenza vlp proteins 58 however production of vlps in mammalian cell expression system is difficult to scale up to the commercial scale especially when using the transient transfection method this limitation can be addressed by preparing stable cell line of corresponding genes for example a stable cell line expressing h1 and n1 genes under the cumate inducible promoter was generated to create 293ha-na cells plasmid with either gag or m1 gene was transiently transfected in 293ha-na cells and vlp yield was compared with gag or m1 protein 293ha-na cells produced seven times more ha and na with gag plasmid transfected cells than its counterpart matrix m1-encoding plasmid 59 gag vlps produced by this approach elicited strong antibody response and provided complete protection against the homologous virus strain optimization of cell density at the time of induction in inducible stable hek293 cell lines also increased vlp yield by five-fold 60 insect cells such as sf9 can be maintained in serum-free suspension cultures and have been often used to prepare recombinant vlps including h7n9 when influenza vlps were compared between insect sf9 cells and mammalian hek293 suspension cells thompson et al found that sf9 cells produce approximately 35 times more vlp than hek293 cells 61 vlps produced from sf9 cells also showed higher ha titer and more homogenous vlps than hek293 cells derived vlps 61 as expected the high titer of baculovirus vector was also present in vlps prepared in sf9 cells however vlps generated in hek293 cells contained extracellular vesicles such as exosomes and microvesicles vlps produced from sf9 insect cells may have a safety advantage over other expression system because insect cells are unlikely to contain human pathogens and baculovirus vector cannot replicate in human cells vlps produced from insect cells show higher yields as compared to mammalian cell-produced vlps which is beneficial for commercial production in the above study sf9 cells produced up to 35 times higher yield than the hek293 cells expression system 61 in addition vlps had higher ha activity and they were more homogenous in morphology and size than mammalian cells produced vlps 61 sf9 cells are usually maintained in a serum free animal product-free medium some of the chemical compounds known as m2 inhibitors such as amantadine-enhanced expression of ha protein in vlps by seven-fold in sf9 expression system 62 however the challenge for vlps expressed using baculovirus expression system is that it is difficult to separate vlps from the baculovirus expression vector during vaccine manufacturing h7n9 vlps have been prepared from the full-length ha na and matrix m1 genes in sf9 cells the h7 ha was derived from ashanghai22013 h7n9 virus while both na and m1 proteins were derived from apuerto rico81934 h1n1 virus a standard donor virus that is often used for preparation of influenza reassortant viruses used in human influenza vaccine production 63 vlps have been isolated from sf9 cells and their morphology resembling native h7n9 virus envelope was confirmed in another study recombinant h7n9 vlp vaccine was prepared from ha and na derived from the aanhui12013 h7n9 virus and the matrix m1 protein derived from the h5n1 virus aindonesia052005 42 as control vaccines vlps were prepared from achickenjaliscocpa12012 h7n3 and aindonesia052005 h5n1 viruses the h7n9 vlps elicited hemagglutination-inhibition hai antibody response against the homologous h7n9 virus cross-reactive hai against the heterologous h7n3 virus and three- to four-fold higher hai response if vlps were administered with iscomatrix saponin-based adjuvant similarly all doses of h7n9 vlp elicited anti-na antibody with three- to four-fold higher responses measured in the corresponding iscomatrix subgroups a lethal murine wild-type aanhui12013 h7n9 challenge demonstrated 100 survival of all animals receiving h7n9 or h7n3 vlp vaccines versus 0 survival in ah5n1 vaccine and placebo groups 42 another study reported a vlp from sf9 cells that consisted of ha na and m1 proteins derived from the human isolate ataiwans020762013h7n9 as a potential vaccine in animal experiments balbc mice and specific-pathogen-free chickens receiving the vlp immunization developed hai serum titer and antibodies against na and m1 proteins 45 the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a h7n9 vlp vaccine were evaluated in the ferret challenge model considered the most appropriate animal model for influenza 31 purified recombinant h7n9 vlps morphologically resembled influenza virions and elicited high-titer serum hai and neutralizing antibodies to aanhui12013 h7n9 virus h7n9 vlp-immunized ferrets were challenged with homologous virus after challenge vlp-vaccinated animals displayed reductions in fever weight loss and virus shedding as compared to the same parameters in the unimmunized control ferrets h7n9 vlp was also effective in protecting against lung and tracheal infection the addition of either iscomatrix or matrix-m1 adjuvant further improved immunogenicity and protection of the vlp vaccine against h7n9 virus 31 another recombinant influenza vaccine was developed by expressing h7 from h7n9 ashanghai22013 on the surface of recombinant baculovirus although this approach would not result in a typical influenza vlp morphology the spatial conformation of h7 in the resulting vaccine is expected to be similar to that in an influenza virion or in a cognate vlp mice were immunized twice either intranasally or subcutaneously with the vaccine the immunogenicity and cross-protective efficacy of the vaccine were evaluated against h7n9 or h7n7 subtype challenges the authors concluded that intranasal administration of h7 protein expressed on the baculovirus envelope can be an alternative way to prime the immune system against influenza infection during a pandemic situation 64 recently a baculovirus vaccine expressing the ha of h7n9 strain achickenjiaxing1482014 was prepared 65 the recombinant baculovirus-ha generated in this study showed favorable growth characteristics in insect cells good safety profile and induced high-level hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer moreover this vaccine demonstrated better efficacy than inactivated whole-virus vaccine jx148 provided complete protection of chickens against challenge with hpai h7n9 virus and effectively inhibited viral shedding plant-based vlp vaccines can be produced from agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of influenza ha proteins in nicotiana benthamiana plant-made h1 or h5 vlps mimicked the structure of influenza virions to some extent they are immunogenic and elicit both humoral and cellular responses 6667 each ha-only particle contains 3050 homo-trimer ha incorporated into lipid bilayer envelope of plant cell origin 68 plant-based recombinant vlp vaccines elicited humoral and cellular responses and protected against challenges for example a plant-derived vlp vaccine based on the ha of influenza h7n9 ahangzhou12013 was prepared with no other influenza proteins included in the vaccine the immunogenicity of such h7-only vlp vaccine was assessed in mice and ferrets after one or two intramuscular doses with and without adjuvant alum or gla-se in ferrets h7-specific cell-mediated immunity was also evaluated the mice and ferrets were challenged with h7n9 aanhui12013 influenza virus a single immunization with the adjuvanted vaccine elicited a strong humoral response and protected mice against an otherwise lethal challenge two doses of unadjuvanted vaccine significantly increased humoral response and resulted in 100 protection with significant reduction in clinical signs leading to nearly asymptomatic infections in ferrets a single immunization with the alum-adjuvanted h7 vlp vaccine induced strong humoral and cmi responses with antigen-specific activation of cd3 t cells this plant-made h7 vaccine therefore induced protective responses after either one adjuvanted or two unadjuvanted doses 39 potentially the plant-based transient expression system can allow the production of vlp structures which contain ha only without other influenza proteins the recombinant ha-only h7 vaccine against h7n9 virus has been also prepared in insect cells 30 the study has shown that purified ha formed rosette-shaped nanoparticles of approximately 3050 nm in diameter 69 similarly subviral particles containing the full-length h7 rha aanhui12013 h7n9 were isolated from sf9 cells treated with mild detergent 38 similarly to a previous study 30 purified rha formed particulate structures the particles were approximately 20 nm in diameter exhibited hemagglutination activity and consisted of approximately 34 trimers of the full-length ha molecules as noted above immunization with vlps have shown promising results in protecting from influenza infections with h7n9 277071 table 2 potentially antibody induced by vlps can be more effective than those of subunit vaccines containing recombinant protein antigens 72 in addition experimental vlp vaccines generally show higher protective rates to high-risk groups such as children and the elderly 26 however the full spectrum of factors affecting immunogenicity of vlps requires additional studies for example it has been shown that amino acid residues of ha that are related to receptor specificity can affect the protective efficacy of h5n1 and h7n9 vaccines in mice 44 h7n9 vlp vaccine that contained l226 mammalian specificity and g228 avian specificity in ha showed better immunogenicity and protection efficacy than vlp containing ha with either l226  s228 or q226  s228 this observation indicated that specific ha residues could enhance a vaccines protection efficacy and ha glycoproteins with both avian-type and human-type receptor specificities may produce better pandemic influenza vaccines for humans 44 while inactivated vaccines have been shown to induce predominantly systemic humoral response vlp vaccines stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses h7n9 vlps secreted from 293t cells triggered both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice this vaccine produced higher levels and antibody and isotypes of igg as well as cross-reactive hai titer against heterologous h1n1 and h1n3 subtypes 43 the presence of na and potentially other iav proteins in vlp could be beneficial the na was demonstrated to protect host from influenza infection 73 mice immunized with na vlps without ha were protected against lethal challenge of homologous apr834 virus without any weight loss 74 furthermore both the exterior and interior of vlps can be altered to enhance their stability and immunogenicity various adjuvants such as alum cpg dna monophosphoryl lipid a mpl poly ic gardiquimod cholera toxin ct can be encapsulated into vlps by exogenous and endogenous methods 7576 these adjuvanted vlps show higher levels of antibodies in both sera and mucosa in another study adjuvants that stimulate tlr3 or nlpr3 pathways showed higher efficiency of influenza vlp vaccine in aged group of mice 77 the cpg-adjuvanted intranasal immunization with an egg-derived split h7n9 vaccine offered a high level of protection against h7n9 infection in mice 78 two phase i clinical trials of experimental h7n9 vlp vaccines with and without adjuvant have been completed nct01897701 and nct02078674 the first study enrolled 284 adults 18 years of age in a randomized observer-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial 79 interestingly enough significant increases in n9 neuraminidase-inhibiting antibodies occurred in up to 719 of recipients of the vaccine without adjuvant 920 of recipients of vaccine with 30 units of adjuvant and 972 of recipients of vaccine with 60 units of adjuvant remarkably the vaccines that were studied were released for human use within 3 months after the availability of the ha and na sequences this illustrates the possibility of rapid response to the public health emergency situations such as in the case of pandemic influenza outbreaks as well as other health emergencies such as the ongoing covid-19 coronavirus pandemic in another previously reported phase i clinical trial subjects vaccinated with two doses of an unadjuvanted h7n9 vlp vaccine responded poorly 156 seroconversion rates with 45 g ha dose in contrast 806 of subjects receiving h7n9 vlp vaccine 5g ha with iscomatrix adjuvant developed hai responses 80 the results suggest that adjuvants can be important component for the development of safe and effective h7n9 human vaccines 81 plant-derived quadrivalent seasonal vlp vaccine has been evaluated and elicited cross-reactive antibody and t cell response in healthy adults 82 although h7n9 antigens have not been included in this study the confirmed safety profile of vlp in humans suggests an attractive alternative manufacturing method for producing effective and ha-strain matching influenza vaccines current annual vaccines inactivated live attenuated and recombinant subunit protect from circulating antigenically matching iav and influenza b virus strains broad protection is difficult to achieve because of the frequent emergence of new strains 83 therefore current approved and experimental vaccines have limited protection against antigenically mismatched variants and newly emerging viral strains for new strains antigenically matching new vaccines have to be developed within short periods of time therefore vaccines are needed that can protect from an antigenically divergent strain especially from potentially pandemic viruses with a new ha subtype in addition to h7n9 virus described above multiple other viruses with pandemic potential including h5n1 h9n2 and h10n8 subtypes that have caused human infections in the past continue to circulate in birds and other animals therefore vaccines capable of protecting against multiple potentially pandemic influenza strains would be advantageous for pandemic preparedness and public health one way to achieve protection against multiple strains and increase the breadth of immune response afforded by vlps can be a blended formulation of monovalent vaccines a vaccine was prepared by mixing vlps that display h1 h3 h5 or h7 ha molecules mice vaccinated with these vlps intranasally showed significant protection 94 aggregate survival following vaccination against 1918 h1 1957 h2 and avian h5 h6 h7 h10 and h11 ha subtypes 41 these experiments suggest a promising and practical strategy for developing a broadly protective influenza vaccine potentially ha molecules from different subtypes can be co-localized within recombinant vlp envelope for broader immune coverage a multi-subtype mosaic vlp design containing three or four subtypes of the full-length rha within the envelope has also been described 5071 a triple-subtype vlp contained ha proteins from the potentially pandemic h5n1 h7n2 and h9n2 subtypes 50 a recombinant baculovirus vector was prepared to co-express the h5 h7 and h9 genes from aviet nam12032004 h5n1 anew york1072003 h7n2 and ahong kong339822009 h9n2 viruses respectively as well as na and m1 genes from apuerto rico81934 h1n1 virus vlps were prepared in sf9 cells and the immunogenicity and efficacy of the resulting h5h7h9 vlps were evaluated in a ferret animal model following intranasal in vaccination we showed that in vaccination with the h5h7h9 triple-subtype vlp induced immune responses and protected ferrets from experimental challenges with three subtypes of avian influenza viruses 50 we also prepared triple-ha mosaic vlps that co-localized avietnam12032004 h5n1 ahong kong339822009 h9n2 and ashanghai22013 h7n9 rha proteins as well as quadri-ha vlps figure 3 by using group antigen gag derived from bovine retrovirus as a vlp core in place of m1 protein quadri-subtype vlps were prepared which co-expressed within the vlp the four ha subtypes derived from avian-origin h5n1 h7n9 h9n2 and h10n8 viruses vlps showed hemagglutination and neuraminidase activities and reacted with specific antisera 84 quadri-subtype vaccine elicited serum antibody in ferrets to the homologous h5 h7 h9 and h10 antigens antiserum was also evaluated for cross-reaction with multiple clades of h5n1 virus and cross-reactivity has been confirmed the level of immune response suggests protection against multiple influenza subtypes which was experimentally confirmed by challenge with h10 iav ferrets were protected from challenge with h10 virus 85 overall such multi-subtype mosaic vlps that co-localize distinct ha subtypes in the envelope showed broader protection range against different influenza viruses 478586 multi-subtype mosaic vlps combine advantages of conserved ha epitope and blended vlps as vlps contain both subtype-specific head epitopes and the conserved stem epitopes recently a vlp preparation consisting of retroviral gag-vlps pseudo-typed with the ha was expressed using the novel trichoplusia ni tni-derived insect cell line tnms42 and tested successfully to assess the sole contribution of anti-ha immunity in limiting post-influenza secondary staphylococcus aureus bacterial infection morbidity and mortality in a situation of a vaccine match and mismatch 87 the results demonstrate that matched anti-ha immunity elicited by a vlp preparation may suffice to prevent morbidity and mortality caused by lethal secondary bacterial infection it should also be noted that cross-reactive antibodies to the h7n9 virus were also induced by recombinant viral vectors such as newcastle disease virus ndv 888990 and parainfluenza virus piv5 91 the emerging strains potentially can be also targeted by universal vaccines consisting of conserved viral proteins or epitopes such as stem region of ha or extracellular domain m2e of the ion channel protein m2 which are both considered capable of inducing cross-reactive immune responses targeting the stem region of ha for antibody production could be a promising approach to generate a broadly protective influenza vaccine the immune response can be elicited against both the head and stem region of ha protein however because of the constantly changing nature of the head region due to the antigenic drift new vaccine candidates need to be updated frequently since the stem region is evolutionally more stable and more conserved among different influenza strains vaccine candidates targeting the stem region might not need to be updated every year and could induce a broad range of protective immunity against different influenza strains 9293 however the stem region is less immunogenic in the virus therefore chimeric vlp approaches have been used to elicit antibodies to the stem region of ha the long alpha-helix lah region located in influenza virus hemagglutinin ha shows conservation among different influenza a strains and could be used as a candidate target for influenza vaccines the hepatitis b virus core protein hbc was used as a carrier for heterologous lah epitopes to elicit effective immune responses 94 the spatial conformation of lah epitope cloned in the major immunodominant region mir of the hbc molecule and expressed in yeast is shown on figure 4 the lah region of the h7n9 influenza virus was inserted into the hbc to prepare chimeric lah-hbc protein which was capable of self-assembly into vlps in e coli expression system 95 intranasal immunization of the lah-hbc vlp in combination with chitosan adjuvant or ctb adjuvant in mice induced both humoral and cellular immune responses effectively and conferred complete protection against lethal challenge with homologous h7n9 virus or heterologous h3n2 virus as well as partial protection against lethal challenge of heterologous h1n1 virus these results provide a proof of concept for lah-hbc vlp vaccine that can be rapidly produced and potentially can serve as an antigen against a future influenza pandemic 95 in another study the globular head domain ha1-2 aa 62284 of the protective h7 ha was fused to the potent tlr5 ligand salmonella typhimurium flagellin flic 96 the resulting fusion protein ha1-2-flic which apparently did not form vlps was efficiently expressed in e coli retained the native ha and flic conformations and was highly immunogenic in mice by intraperitoneal vaccination furthermore highly immunogenic influenza vlps have been prepared via the overexpression of four viral proteins ha na m1 and m2 using m2 fusion with the flic 97 the chimeric h5n1 vlps were further combined with the molecular adjuvant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf flic or a gm-csfflic 98 all three forms of the chimeric h5n1 vlps elicited protective immunity against live virus next the gm-csfflic h5n1 vlps were obtained to include h7 or h1h7 antigens for developing multi-subtype influenza vaccines 98 the chimeric norovirus vlps p particles were used to express the trivalent ha290-105 epitopes derived from h1 h3 and b subtypes with 24 copies in total on the surface loops 99 finally trimeric h7 transiently expressed in n benthamiana was conjugated successfully onto the surface of nanodiamond particles 100 after two or three immunizations in mice the mixture of trimeric h7 protein and nanodiamond elicited statistically significant stronger h7-specific-igg response demonstrated by higher amounts of h7n9-specific igg other universal influenza vaccine approaches applicable to h7n9 were based on ion channel protein m2 extracellular part of m2 protein 23 aa residues is highly conserved among human iav strains suggesting its potential utility as a broadly protective immunogen for the development of broadly protective influenza vaccines tandem repeats of heterologous m2e sequences m2e5x derived from human swine and avian origin influenza a viruses were expressed on influenza vlps in a membrane-anchored form immunization of mice with m2e5x vlps induced antibodies that were cross-reactive to antigenically distinct influenza a viruses and conferred cross-protection 101 furthermore the m2e5x vlps demonstrated a clear advantage in inducing igg2a isotype antibodies t cell responses plasma cells and germinal center b cells as well as in conferring cross protection 102 these studies paved the way to a novel vaccination strategy by enhancing the cross protective efficacy of live attenuated influenza virus vaccines by supplemented vaccination with m2e5x vlps 103 high immunogenicity in mice even in the absence of adjuvants was demonstrated by the m2e displayed on vlps of macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus 104105 this novel vaccine candidate was tested by the h1n1 and h3n2 challenge in mice and potentially it can be universal and applicable to h7n9 virus in another example the m2e proteins as well as na were expressed on recombinant lactococcus lactis which conferred effective mucosal and systemic immune responses 106 heterogenous composition is one of the challenges associated with the use of influenza vlps as a vaccine candidate vlps produced by using baculovirus expression system contain live baculovirus vector as impurity moreover considerable fraction of ha protein is bound to viral envelope of baculovirus 107 therefore it is difficult to distinguish whether the ha activity is associated with influenza vlp or with baculovirus-displayed ha in the unpurified samples during vaccine manufacturing which also causes difficulty for ha quantification vlps produced from mammalian expression system do not contain baculovirus contamination but they contain extracellular particles and produce low yields with vlps needing to be concentrated up to 200 times to reach measurable titers 72 the current methods that are used for quantification are mostly applicable to concentrated and purified vlps however better methods need to be developed to characterize the materials at the different stage of bioprocessing during the manufacturing process other potential challenges include the presence of endogenous rhabdovirus in standard sf9 cell lines 108 although insect rhabdovirus is not associated with any human disease the development of rhabdovirus-free cell line can resolve this potential safety concern 108109 to overcome manufacturing challenges technological improvements to production of h7n9 vlps in baculovirus-sf9 insect cell cultures have been reported 110111112 the yield and quality of influenza vlps produced in insect cells could be improved by inhibiting cytopathic effects of the protein m2 62 the ion channel activity of m2 induces significant cytopathic effects in sf9 insect cells these effects include altered sf9 cell morphology and reduced baculovirus replication resulting in impaired influenza protein expression and thus vlp production the use of the m2 inhibitor amantadine indeed improved sf9 cellular expression not only of m2 three-fold but also of ha seven-fold and of matrix protein m1 three-fold when co-expressed to produce influenza vlps this increased cellular expression of all three influenza proteins further led to two-fold greater vlp yield the quality of the resulting influenza vlps was significantly improved as demonstrated by the two-fold 50-fold and two-fold increase in the antigen density to approximately 53 ha 48 m1 and 156 m2 per influenza vlp respectively 62 for purification of influenza vlps a nitrocellulose membrane-based filtration system 113 and a cascade of ultrafiltration and diafiltration steps followed by a sterile filtration step 109114 were used successfully the bioprocessing of influenza vlps was recently reviewed 115 recently a fast chromatography step purification method was developed for chimeric hiv-1 gag influenza-ha vlps produced in tnms42 insect cells using the baculovirus insect cell expression vector system 116 the absence of the baculovirus capsid protein p39 in the product fraction was confirmed by hplc-ms the process is simple and includes only a few handling steps which has promising characteristics to become a platform for purification of these types of vlps 116 regarding the detection and quality assessment of influenza vaccines several methodologies are being used these include development of standards for potency determination 117 a high-resolution lc-ms method allows the quantitation of both ha and na protein concentrations in influenza vlp vaccine candidates 118 recombinant vlps were developed with the purpose of rapidly preparing influenza vaccines including against pandemic threat viruses such as h7n9 virus multiple designs of vlps have been evaluated including the use of multivalent vlps multi-subtype mosaic vlp and rationally designed vlps containing conserved influenza virus epitopes the use of highly conserved epitopes remains a promising approach for the improved design of highly immunogenic vlps blended vlps have been used as a classic approach to broaden immune coverage multi-subtype mosaic vlps potentially combine the conserved epitope and blended approaches as vlps contain both subtype-specific head epitopes and the conserved stem epitopes in addition to vlps other novel technologies have been used to develop improved influenza vaccines including dna vaccines viral vectors advanced adjuvants and other approaches potentially the combination of various technologies can prove beneficial for the development of next-generation influenza vaccines including h7n9  the activity of influenza and influenza-like viruses in individuals aged over 14 in the 20152016 influenza season in poland mieczyslaw pokorski d kowalczyk k cielak k szymaski l brydak b   influenza is an infectious viral disease of the respiratory system caused by influenza viruses belonging to orthomyxoviridae there are three types of the influenza virus a b and c among which infections caused by type c are asymptomatic in every epidemic season infections are induced by influenza virus type a and b with usually a different course of illness for either type of virus which also depends on the patients age and the immune systems efficiency brydak 2008 influenza a virus is divided into subtypes depending on the combination of the surface antigens hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na there are 18 types of ha and 11 types of na described wu et al 2014 improperly treated infections caused by influenza viruses can lead to complications and consequently to death therefore it is important to confirm the presence of influenza virus in a short period of time using

hospitalizations and 140 deaths due to complications of influenza including 135 deaths among people over 14 years of age the peak incidence of ili occurred in week 8 of 2016 during the season more than 8500 samples were tested and more than 5000 of them were collected from people aged over 14 the distribution of confirmed cases of influenza viruses by age and the viral type are shown in figs 1 and 2 the highest percentage of confirmations was observed in the persons aged 4564 131 of cases less in those aged 2644 126 and over 65 99 of cases while in the group of 1525 years of age viruses were confirmed in 46 of cases the dominant type was influenza a virus subtype ah1n1pdm09 the highest number of confirmed cases of this subtype was reported in the persons aged 4564 n  489 while in those aged 2644 and over 65 the numbers of confirmed cases were comparable 350 and 336 respectively in the persons aged 1525 subtype ah1n1pdm09 was confirmed in 66 cases the subtype ah1n1 was detected in individual cases in all age-groups with more than 10 cases present only in the persons aged over 65 fig 1 concerning the unsubtyped influenza virus type a the number of confirmed cases was similar in all age-groups investigated amounting to 64 cases in the persons aged 1525 67 cases in those aged 2644 70 cases in those aged 4564 and 52 cases in those aged over 65 concerning the subtype ah3n2 single cases were observed in persons aged 2644 and 4564 fig 1

 there also were confirmed cases of influenza b in individuals over 14 years of age this was actually the dominant type of influenza virus in persons aged 1525 however the highest number of cases of influenza virus type b was found in the persons aged 2644 n  201 far fewer in those aged 1525 years n  95 4564 years n  85 and over 65 years n  89 fig 2 in the 20152016 influenza season there were just 16 cases of influenza-like viruses reported with rsv n  6 piv-3 n  4 and adv n  3 reported most frequently and with individual cases of piv 1 hcov and rhv ab virues the number of 3864731 cases and suspected cases of influenza and influenza-like viruses in the 20152016 influenza epidemic season in poland was comparable to that present in the preceding season niph-nih 20152016 however the number of hospitalizations and deaths due to complications increased dramatically the number of deaths increased from 11 in 20142015 to 140 in 20152016 table 1
 despite a comparable number of cases and suspected cases of influenza and influenza-like viruses the number of confirmed cases increased to 402 in 20152016 up from 212 in 20142015 bednarska et al 2016 there also was a difference in the most frequent contagion between the two seasons with subtype ah1n1pdm09 626 predominating in 20152016 as opposed to ah3n2 predominating the season before in persons over 14 years of age hallmann-szeliska et al 2016 the present study demonstrates that subtype ah1n1pdm09 predominated in all age groups except for 1524 years old persons in whom virus type b was dominant fig 2 in both compared seasons the highest incidence of influenza was reported in the age-groups of 4564 and 2644 years and the lowest one in the 1524 years old persons fig 1 bednarska et al 2016b interestingly the number of confirmed cases of influenza virus was the highest in the same age-groups of 4564 and 2644 years in the past 20132014 season bednarska et al 2015 we also found that the activity of rsv and piv-3 was increased in 20152016 compared with that in the season before niph-nih 20152016 the following strains were included into the influenza vaccine in the 20152016 season acalifornia72009h1n1pdm09 aswitzerland97152932013h3n2 and bphuket30732013 a particular attention should be paid to the acalifornia72009h1n1pdm09 strain which was a vaccine component since the 20102011 season and also caused most influenza cases in persons over 14 years of age in the currently evaluated season given that the percentage of vaccinated population in this age range in poland ranks at a dismally low level and has a decreasing trend from 195 in 2011 to 137 in 2015 epimeld 2016 it can be judged that that the recorded number of influenza cases reflects the immunodeficiency to this viral strain brydak 2015 an increased number of confirmed cases of infection in the currently evaluated season was mainly caused by the influenza virus and to a lesser extent by influenza-like viruses which may lead to a severer disease course complications and in consequence to death the death as a sequelae of influenza was due usually to complications arising from the underlying chronic comorbidities especially cardiovascular and respiratory disorders that ended up in fulminant pneumonia the present findings of 402 of confirmed cases of influenza and influenza-like viruses in the 20152016 influenza season show a near doubling of laboratory confirmations compared with past seasons bednarska et al 2016b bednarska et al 2015 that result points to substantial improvements in infection surveillance and imbued nuances in the virological and epidemiological procedures despite a drastically low and inexplicably decreasing percentage of adult mostly middle-aged population getting vaccinated against influenza each epidemic season in poland the virological data presented in this article seek to call repeat attention to the need to vaccinate against influenza as the most effective method of preventing the infection and its severe complications death included a need advocated by the who major medical societies and 142 national influenza centers worldwide  antigenic and

strains were observed by indirect immunofluorescence tests however in virus neutralization tests antisera to 1 cd and 2 wd strains had 16-fold or lower antibody titers against 3 wd and 1 cd strains than against the homologous strains and this variation reflected low antigenic relatedness values r 13-25 suggesting the presence of different subtypes among bcv in hemagglutination inhibition tests some one-way antigenic variations among strains were also observed these results suggest that some antigenic and biological diversity exists among bcv strains but these variations were unrelated to the clinical source of the strains ie cd or wd bovine coronavirus bcv is a primary cause of neonatal calf diarrhea cd worldwide 4 13  bovine coronavirus is also associated with acute diarrhea in adult cattle during the winter season referred to as winter dysentery wd 4 17 18 24 26  besides infecting the small and large intestines of calves bcv also possesses a tissue tropism for the upper respiratory tract 15  h tsunemitsu and l j saif bovine coronavirus has four major structural proteins the nucleocapsid protein n the transmembrane protein m the spike protein s and the hemagglutininesterase protein he 21  the s and he proteins form fringes of longer and shorter surface projections respectively 4  both proteins can cause hemagglutination ha and contain neutralizing epitopes 7 20  the he protein also possesses receptor-destroying enzyme rde which inactivates cellular receptors for bcv by hydrolyzing an ester bond to release acetate from c-9 of sialic acid 4 27  because the primary isolation of bcv remains difficult there have been only a few investigations on antigenic comparisons of bcv strains 6 8 11 14  specifically whether antigenic or biological differences exist between strains derived from cd and wd remains obscure 2  the purpose of this study was to isolate bcv strains from feces derived from cd and wd in human rectal tumor hrt-18 cells and to compare the antigenic and biological properties of these strains and was propagated 8 times in hrt-18 cells six wd isolates of bcv designated as the ts cn be bm aw and bw strains were isolated from fecal samples of gnotobiotic calves which had been inoculated with fecal filtrates from affected adult dairy cows from 6 herds in the usa including ohio 3 herds and wisconsin 3 herds which were experiencing typical outbreaks of wd during the winters of 1987 to 1993 three cd isolates of bcv designated as the db2 ohc and sdc strains were isolated from fecal samples of neonatal calves with acute diarrhea from 3 herds in the usa including ohio 2 herds and south dakota 1 herd a fourth cd isolate jaz was isolated from a neonatal calf with acute diarrhea in hokkaido japan virus isolation on hrt-18 cells was done as previously described 2 25 except that 10 ggml of pancreatin gibco laboratories grand island ny was added to the maintenance medium confirmation of the isolates as bcv was done by using immune electron microscopy  16 and immunofluorescence if 2 with hyperimmune antiserum prepared against the mebus strain ofcd bcv the isolated viruses which were passaged a total of 5 to 10 times in hrt-18 cells were plaque-purified at least once before use hyperimmune antisera were prepared in guinea pigs against 3 cd strains mebus db2 216xf and 7 wd strains sd bm cn aw dba ts be of bcv that had been propagated in hrt-18 cells for 6 to 11 passages and then purified on sucrose gradients 5  these antisera were used for serological tests hemagglutination ha tests were conducted by the microtiter method 19  bovine coronavirus strains were purified from infected-cell culture supernatants  which were concentrated approximately 100-to 200-fold serial 2-fold dilutions of bcv were prepared in 005 ml of veronal buffered saline containing 01 bovine serum albumin and 0001 gelatin and mixed with 005 ml of 08 and 04 suspensions of mouse and pooled adult chicken erythrocytes respectively in the same buffer the mixtures were then incubated for 1 h at either 4 or 37 c and the ha titers were determined the plates incubated at 4 c were moved to 37 c for 2 h to measure inactivation of receptors reflected by the disaggregation of the bcv-erythrocyte complexes mediated by the receptor destroying enzyme rde activity 22  antigenic comparisons of bcv strains were done by indirect if virus neutralization vn and ha inhibition hi tests the indirect if tests were performed as previously described 8  virus titration and vn tests were conducted with hrt-18 cells in microplates as previously described 25  virus infectivity titers were expressed as median tissue culture infective doses tcids0ml the vn antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely inhibited cytopathic effects cpe the antigenic relatedness r between the strains was calculated using the formula 1 8  in which rl is heterologous titer strain 2homologous titer strain 1 and r2 is heterologous titer strain 1homologous titer strain 2 the hi test was done using standard techniques with mouse erythrocytes  19 and sera treated with kaolin and mouse erythrocytes the antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilutions producing complete hi cytopathic effects were evident in hrt-18 cells inoculated with each of the strains of bcv cytopathic effects were characterized by enlarged rounded and densely granular cells that occurred in clusters at 2 to 3 postinoculation days 2  and no differences were observed in cpe among these strains syncytia were also clearly observed in hrt-18 cells at 2 days after inoculation with these strains following staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-bcv serum infectivity titers of bcv reached 10 7 to 10 8-7 tcidsjml at the 5th to 10th passages on hrt-18 cells the ha and rde titers of purified bcv strains are summarized in table 1  all strains agglutinated mouse erythrocytes and no differences were observed in ha titers against mouse erythrocytes at 4  and 37 c all strains also agglutinated chicken erythrocytes at 4 c but the ha titers varied among the bcv strains this diversity was reflected in variations of the ratios of ha titer with mouse erythrocytes to ha titer with chicken erythrocytes mc ha titer ratio at 4 c however there was no relation between mc ha titer ratio and the clinical source cd or wd of the strains at 37 c the mebus and db2 strains of cd bcv and the dba and sd strains of wd bcv agglutinated chicken erythrocytes with the same ha titers as at 4 c however the other strains of bcv did not agglutinate chicken erythrocytes at 37 c and showed rde activity against chicken erythrocytes receptor-destroying enzyme activity with mouse erythrocytes was not uexpressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of virus causing complete disappearance of ha patterns at 4 c after 2 h incubation at 37 c  cd calf diarrhea wd winter dysentery of adult cattle dmc ratio of ha titer with mouse erythrocytes to ha titer with chicken erythrocytes detected for any strain of bcv according to these results bcv strains were classified into 3 groups the first group cd isolates mebus db2 and wd isolates dba sd showed low mc ha titer ratios16 no differences in ha titers against chicken erythrocytes at 4 and 37 c and no rde activity against chicken erythrocytes the second group cd isolate 216xf and wd isolates cn be awshowed low mc ha titer ratios 32 no ha against chicken erythrocytes at 37 c and rde activity with chicken erythrocytes the third group cd isolates ohc sdc jaz and wd isolates ts bm bw showed high mc ha titer ratios 256 no ha against chicken erythrocytes at 37 c and rde activity with chicken erythrocytes these variations in ha and rde activities were unrelated to the clinical source of the isolates cd or wd in indirect if tests all of the antisera reacted to each virus strain with high titer 102 400 to 409 600 and each antiserum showed no significant differences in reactivity with the homologous and heterologous strains not greater than twofold differences the results of vn tests are shown in table 2  all of the antisera neutralized the heterologous strains showing that the strains were closely related antigenically however antisera to the mebus cd and sd and bm wd strains showed 16-fold or lower vn antibody titers against the dba ts be and bw wd strains and the 216xf jaz ohc and sdc cd strains than against the homologous strains these differences were reflected in the r values the mebus sd and bm strains generated r  values of 13 to 25 against the dba ts be and 216xf strains the hi antibody titers are shown in table 3  all of the strains showed crossreactivity but differences in antibody titers were observed the db2 strain of cd bcv and the sd strain ofwd bcv were closely related in the hi tests and antisera to these strains distinguished most other strains with 16-fold or greater differences in the hi antibody titers bovine coronavirus causes neonatal cd 13 and is also associated with wd of adult cattle 17  based on epidemiological data these disease syndromes often occur as separate and distinct outbreaks in herds 4 12 17  hence antigenic or biological differences between cd and wd bcv might be expected calf diarrhea bcv isolates belong to a single serotype 4 15 25  but minor antigenic and biological variations among them have been revealed in limited studies 6 8 11 14 23  in this study we compared the antigenic and biological diversity of a variety of wd and cd bcv isolates storz et al 23 reported that variations in the ratios of ha titers with mouse erythrocytes to those with chicken erythrocytes mc ha titer ratio in this report expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum inhibiting ha activity homologous titers are in bold titers which differed by 16-tbld or greater with homologous titers are underlined bcd calf diarrhea wd winter dysentery of adult cattle were observed among cd bcv strains the l9 strain of cd bcv at the high cell culture passage level the 78th passage showed a low mtc ha titer ratio 8 whereas the wild type cd bcv strains at low cell culture passage levels the 3rd to 8th passages showed high mc ha titer ratios 128 to 256 in this study the high cell culture-passaged mebus strain of cd bcv the 77th passage showed a low mc ha titer ratio 2 but some low cell culture-passaged cd strains db2 216xf and wd strains cn dba sd be aw of bcv the 5th to 10th passages also showed low mc ratios 4 to 32 the differences in ha titers against chicken erythrocytes at 4  and 37 c showed good agreement with the rde titers for chicken erythrocytes this suggests that comparison of ha titers obtained at 4  and 37 c may provide an alternative method for evaluting rde activity on the basis of ha and rde patterns bcv strains were classified into 3 groups however each group contained both cd and wd bcv and no relationship between each group and the clinical cd or wd or geographic origin of the strains was observed all strains of both cd and wd bcv examined in this study were related antigenically specially each antiserum showed no significant difference between the homologous and heterologous strains in indirect if antibody titers however some antigenic diversity among bcv strains was observed by vn and hi tests in our previous report 2  hyperimmune antiserum prepared in a gnotobiotic calf to the mebus strain of cd bcv had an 8-to 32-fold lower vn antibody titer against the dba strain ofwd bcv than against the homologous strain in this study guinea pig hyperimmune antiserum to the mebus strain showed similar vn antibody titer differences between homologous and the dba strains in addition this serum also distinguished three other strains ofwd bcv and four strains ofcd bcv from the homologous virus by 16-to 64-fold differences moreover hyperimmune antisera to the sd and bm strains ofwd bcv also distinguished the same strains which were distinguished by the anti-mebus serum form homologous strains by 16-to 64-fold differences in antibody titers in vn tests although these variations were recognized only in one-way reactions and all strains examined could be classified into a single serotype the strains showing these variations might be further divided into 2 subtypes the mebus sd and bm strains which belong to the same potential subtype could be distinguished from the dba ts be and 216xf strains which constitute another possible subtype r values of 13 to 25 the bw jaz ohc and sdc strains also appeared to belong to the latter subtype the db2 cn and aw strains comprised an intermediate group that cross-reacted with both subtypes interestingly antiserum to the mebus strain of bcv which had been prepared in guinea pig in japan showed only a 2-fold lower vn antibody titer against the 216xf strain than against the homologous strain 25  in the present study antiserum to the mebus strain prepared in the usa had 16-fold vn antibody titer differences against the homologous and 216xf strains the reason for this discrepancy is unknown but differences in the passage level of the mebus strain at the preparation of antiserum might affect the virus antigenicity 10  alternatively contamination of cultures with other bcv might occur after import and propagation in japan bovine coronavirus strains examined in this study showed minor antigenic and biological variations but this diversity was unrelated to the geographic origin or affected animal age groups wd and cd from which these strains were recovered based on preliminary data gnotobiotic and colostrum-deprived calves inoculated orally and nasally with wd bcv shed bcv rectally and nasally and developed diarrhea which was indistinguishable from disease symptoms in calves inoculated with cd bcv 9  also a cow inoculated via a duodenal cannula with cd bcv developed diarrhea and shed bcv h tsunemitsu et at 1994 unpublished data these results suggest that the differences in these disease syndromes wd and cd are not related to viral factors but to host and environmental factors eg the immunological status of animals environmental temperatures secondary or coinfections with other pathogens etc 3 12 17  further studies are in progress to compare the antigenicity of bcv strains using monoclonal antibodies and in vivo cross-protection tests  cryptosporidiosis caused by cryptosporidium parvum subtype iida15g1 at a dairy farm in northwestern china zhaohui cui rongjun wang jianying huang haiyan wang jinfeng zhao nannan luo junqiang li zhenjie zhang longxian zhang   species of cryptosporidium are important zoonotic parasites that infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts including humans 1 there are extensive genetic variations within the cryptosporidium genus in addition to 27 recognized species of cryptosporidium more than 70 cryptosporidium genotypes with no designated species names have been described 25 cryptosporidium can be transmitted by the faecal-oral route via either direct contact or ingestion of contaminated food or water 1 cryptosporidiosis caused by cryptosporidium infection is of great concern because of associated economic losses and the public health significance in humans diarrhoea is a typical clinical sign of human and animal cryptosporidiosis dehydration fever nausea and anorexia are sometimes symptoms in infected hosts over 200 water-borne food-borne person-to-person and zoonotic cryptosporidiosis outbreaks have been recorded 6 the most famous cryptosporidiosis outbreak occurred in milwaukee wisconsin usa where 403000 people were infected through contaminated drinking water 7 in recent years cryptosporidiosis outbreaks have been reported in several european and american countries 811 molecular techniques have shown that c parvum is the predominant species in cryptosporidiosis outbreaks accounting for 508 of cases among 325 water-borne outbreaks of parasitic protozoan diseases worldwide 6 cattle are the most common mammalian species in which cryptosporidium is detected pre-weaned calves are considered reservoirs for zoonotic c parvum 12 of 14 c parvum subtype families iia iib iic iid iie iif iig iih iii iik iil iim iin and iio iia and iid are the two major zoonotic subtype families in animals and humans while iic and iie are anthroponotic subtype families 13 other subtype families of c parvum are occasionally seen in humans and other animals 214 in china cryptosporidium infections have been reported in domestic animals wild animals and humans 1318 a cryptosporidiosis outbreak was noticed in a paediatric hospital in shanghai 19 in the current study we have briefly described a cryptosporidiosis outbreak that occurred at a dairy farm in the ningxia autonomous region northwestern china the infection rate and species distribution of cryptosporidium were also determined the investigated farm located in the ningxia autonomous region of northwestern china was established in july 2012 with 7000 dairy cattle 2600 calves and 4400 adult cattle the breeding cattle were introduced from australia and uruguay while forage was produced in the united states previously vaccination was not done against rotaviruses coronaviruses and e coli before this outbreak cryptosporidium oocysts were not detected using conventional faecal examination by microscopy in october 2013 severe diarrhoea was observed in 396 pre-weaned calves on this farm 356 of the calves in particular the 23-week-olds died despite being treated with antibiotics we collected 30 faecal samples from calves with diarrhoea and subjected them to testing for gastrointestinal pathogens rota corona e coli f5 k99 crypto using the commercial digestive kit real bio-technology qingdao china one month later the symptom of diarrhoea gradually disappeared in calves during specimen collection all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the chinese laboratory animal administration act 1988prior to experiment the protocol of the current study wasreviewed and approved by the research ethics committee of henan agricultural university license no 2014-018 to determine infection rate and species distribution of cryptosporidium we obtained 252 faecal samples 158 were from pre-weaned calves 55 from post-weaned calves and 39 from heifers and adults fresh faecal samples for each animal were collected immediately after defecation on the ground cryptosporidium oocysts in faecal samples were concentrated using sheathers sugar flotation technique with samples from pre-weaned calves subjected to formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation 14 cryptosporidium-positive samples were determined by microscopy and stored in 25 potassium dichromate at 4c prior to dna extraction genomic dna was extracted from cryptosporidium-positive faecal samples using the ezna stool dna kit omega biotek inc norcross ga usa according to the manufacturers recommended procedures cryptosporidium species were determined by polymerase chain reaction pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism rflp analysis and by dna sequence analysis of the small subunit ssu rrna gene 20 subtyping of c parvum was conducted using a nested pcr technique targeting the gp60 gene which encodes the 60 kda glycoprotein 221 amplicons were sequenced on an abi prismtm 3730 xl dna analyzer using the big dye terminator v31 cycle sequencing kit applied biosystems foster city ca usa sequence accuracy was confirmed by two-directional sequencing and by sequencing a fresh pcr amplicon if necessary sequence alignment was carried out using clustalx 183 ftpftp-igbmcu-strasbgfrpubclustalx representative nucleotide sequences were deposited in genbank accession numbers km215133-km215134 and km873712-km873713 using the digestive kit we found that nine samples were positive for cryptosporidium and four were positive for rotavirus none of the samples analyzed with the digestive kit were positive for coronavirus or e coli f5 k99 microscopy examination revealed the overall prevalence of cryptosporidium to be 21 53252 the infection rate was 31 49158 73 455 and 0 039 for pre-weaned 311-month-old and 1-year-old animals respectively the highest infection rate of 833 4048 was seen in 23-week-old calves that had severe diarrhoea three cryptosporidium species were identified based on rflp and sequence analysis of the ssu rrna gene there were 51 c parvum isolates in pre-weaned n  48 and 311-month-old n  3 calves one c bovis isolate in a 311-month-old calf and one c ryanae isolate in a pre-weaned calf all c parvum isolates were successfully amplified at the gp60 locus with sequencing analysis suggesting they were the iida15g1 subtype diarrhoea is common in calves worldwide and is considered a major cause of productivity decline and economic losses in the cattle industry 22 previous studies have indicated that rotaviruses coronaviruses e coli and c parvum are all contributing factors to diarrhoea in calves however c parvum is believed to be the primary cause of calf diarrhoea and is a potential zoonotic agent 2324 results from the digestive kit in combination with high cryptosporidium prevalence 833 in 23-week-old calves with diarrhoea were strong indicators that c parvum was likely most responsible for diarrhoea and death an overall infection rate of 21 on this farm was higher than that observed in heilongjiang 150 henan 130 and shannxi 34 provinces in china 142528 the highest level of prevalence 833 in 23-week-old calves was similar to that seen in previous studies 29 and was consistent with the morbidity and mortality of calves in this age group the predominance of c parvum infection in pre-weaned calves seen in this study was highly similar to those seen in most studies conducted in other countries 2142728 it is known that c parvum is a major etiological agent for sporadic cases or water- and food-borne disease outbreaks in humans worldwide 93033 as a major reservoir of c parvum pre-weaned calves might play an important role in zoonotic infections 12 previously the c parvum subtype iida15g1 has been detected in cattle sheep and goats in iran malaysia and spain 3437 it has also been found in humans from the netherlands australia iran malaysia and india 3741 the iida15g1 subtype identified in this study was unlikely to have arrived via uruguay or the united states because the c parvum iid subtype family has never been found in the americas 13 it is also unlikely that iida15g1 was introduced from australia because c parvum has not been detected in australian breeding cattle thus the source of the cryptosporidiosis outbreak could be attributed to c parvum contamination in the area surrounding the farm the iida15g1 subtype has been found in rodents in china with c parvum isolates from animals all belonging to the iid subtype 14182728 generally iid is a major zoonotic subtype family reported in europe hungary germany portugal sweden ireland spain belgium romania the united kingdom the netherlands slovenia and serbia and montenegro asia kuwait iran jordan india malaysia and china africa egypt and ethiopia and australia 13144243 in comparison with cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in humans only a few outbreaks have been reported in animals including goats in brazil and oman 4445 foals in new zealand 46 cockatiels in japan 47 stone curlews in the united arab emirates 48 alpaca crias in the united states 49 chelonians in australia 50 and rabbits in poland 51 the findings from our current study provide further information regarding cryptosporidiosis outbreaks among animal populations in conclusion this is the first report of a cryptosporidiosis outbreak in chinese dairy cattle the c parvum iida15g1 subtype was responsible for the reported outbreak as determined by genotyping and subtyping tools further studies are required to improve our understanding of the transmission and public health significance of cryptosporidium species in china this is the first report of a cryptosporidiosis outbreak in chinese dairy cattle the c parvum iida15g1 subtype was responsible for the reported outbreak as determined by genotyping and subtyping tools  advances in the relationship between coronavirus infection and cardiovascular diseases mengmeng zhao menglong wang jishou zhang jing ye yao xu zhen wang di ye jianfang liu jun wan   at the end of 2019 a number of patients with fever and clinical pneumonia of unknown origin were found in wuhan hubei china 1 through virus isolation gene detection and the analysis of protein structure in the laboratories the disease was identified as 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by a new kind of coronavirus researchers have found that this new coronavirus belongs to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 2 3 4 this novel coronavirus is currently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 on february 12 2020 the world health organization who announced that the disease caused by sars-cov-2 was officially named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 covid-19 is another serious infectious disease caused by coronavirus after severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2015 sars-cov-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans 1 since january 2020 covid-19 has rapidly spread throughout china causing serious harm to human health up to april 27 2020 at least 2878196 patients have been confirmed to have covid-19 all over the world of whom 198668 have died 5 the who characterized covid-19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 after it announced that covid-19 in china was a public health emergency of international concern pheic on january 31 2020 67 due to the severe outbreak of covid-19 and its wide-ranging scope strict prevention and control strategies should be implemented in the affected countries and the treatment of infected individuals should receive more attention as reported by the china centers for disease control and prevention approximately 128 of patients with covid-19 have hypertension and 4 of patients have cardiovascular disease cvd the mortality rate of patients with cardiovascular disease is much higher than that of patients without comorbidities 8 growing evidence suggests that combined cardiovascular disease may increase the severity of coronavirus infection and lead to a poor prognosis 9 10 11 12 13 at the same time there is also evidence suggesting that serum levels of cardiac necrosis biomarkers have increased to varying degrees in both mild and severe covid-19 patients suggesting different degrees of myocardial damage 9 10 11 12 13 14 moreover the study found that the markers of myocardial necrosis in severe and deceased covid-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild covid-19 patients suggesting that cardiac damage may be related to poor prognosis 9101213 existing evidence suggests that covid-19 is closely related to cardiovascular disease but the specific interaction between the two is unclear this paper describes the relationship between coronavirus and cardiovascular diseases through a review of the literature and datasets about sars mers and other diseases caused by the human coronavirus hoping to provide some assistance for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 coronaviruses covs are the largest group of viruses belonging to the nidovirales order which includes the coronaviridae arteriviridae and roniviridae families covs are further subdivided into four groups the    and  covs 15 the newly discovered sars-cov-2 belongs to the -covs 2 all covs are enveloped nonsegmented positive-sense rna viruses 15 the most significant feature of covs is the club-shaped spike projections emanating from the surface of the virion therefore cov look like a tiny corona as depicted in studies by cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy prompting the name coronavirus 16 17 18 cov is a respiratory virus that exists widely in nature its natural hosts include humans and other mammals such as pigs dogs cats mice and bats 19 at present seven human coronaviruses hcovs have been discovered in which hcov-229e 20 hcov-nl63 2122 hcov-oc43 23 24 25 hcov-hku1 26 sars-cov 27 28 29 30 and mers-cov 3132 are included in addition to sars-cov-2 recently isolated from the respiratory tracts of patients with covid-19 in wuhan 2 3 4 hcovs mainly cause respiratory infections of which four endemic hcovs hcov-nl63 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 mainly cause mild respiratory infections and the other three epidemic hcovs sars-cov mers-cov sars-cov-2 can cause acute severe pneumonia 1933 coronaviruses originally discovered as hcov-229e are the cause of respiratory infections in children and adults but they are not particularly dangerous patients respiratory symptoms are mild similar to those of the common cold 34 most clinically significant coronavirus infections occur in children under two years of age although adults can also be severely infected 3536 mortality is negligible 37 however sars-cov and mers-cov which have appeared since 2003 are highly contagious and cause a high incidence and mortality rate of pneumonia 3337 38 39 in addition to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 is another human coronavirus that can cause severe pneumonia 1 the researchers compared the sequence of sars-cov-2 from wuhan with that of sars-cov and mers-cov through genetic testing and found that the gene sequence of sars-cov-2 is almost identical with a homology to mers of approximately 40 and a higher degree of homology to sars of approximately 70 40 the differences between the sequences are mainly in the orf1a gene and the spike gene encoding s-protein which is the key protein for the interaction between coronavirus and host cells 40 the coronavirus spike protein is a multifunctional molecular machine that mediates coronavirus entry into host cells it first binds to a receptor on the host cell surface through its s1 subunit and then fuses viral and host membranes through its s2 subunit 4142 some cellular receptors of human coronavirus have been identified including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 404344 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 45and aminopeptidase n apn 46 coronavirus enters the human body through receptors on the surface of host cells multiplies in the body and causes inflammation in the body and diseases such as pneumonia similar to sars-cov ace2 was found to be a receptor for sars-cov-2 434748 ace2 is also an important member of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas it catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin ii ang ii to angiotensin 1-7 activates downstream mas receptors and finally exerts anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects 49 in addition ace2 can also decompose ang ii into angiotensin 1-9 angiotensin 1-9 not only can be catalyzed by ace and further decompose into angiotensin 1-7 but also can directly activate ang  type 2 receptor at2r exerting its anti-inflammatory and anti-angiotensin  type 1 receptor at1r effects 50 ace2 is primarily expressed in the heart kidneys and testes and it is widely distributed in human alveolar epithelial cells small intestinal epithelial cells arterial smooth muscle and endothelial cells and vein endothelial cells 5152 in the heart ace2 is expressed in the endothelium 51 and cardiomyocytes 53 increasing evidence suggests that ace2 enzyme activity has a protective role in cardiovascular disease the loss of ace2 can be harmful because it may lead to worsened heart function and the progression of heart and vascular disease 4954 virus-induced ace2 down regulation may attenuate its function diminish its anti-inflammatory role and heightened angiotensin ii effects in the predisposed patients 55 the tissue localization of the receptors correlates with covid-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction in the lung ace2 is expressed in type i and type ii alveolar epithelial cells in addition 83 of type ii alveolar cells express ace2 56 the combination of sars-cov-2 with ace2 results in increased expression of ace2 which can lead to alveolar cell damage in turn triggering a series of whole-body reactions and even death 48 wrapp et al 18 found that the receptor-binding ability of sars-cov-2 is 10-20 times stronger than that of sars-cov providing a laboratory basis to prove that sars-cov-2 is more infectious than sars-cov 3 there is evidence showing that ace2 levels are higher in men than in women 48 however the male-to-female ratio of ncp-confirmed cases is 0991 in wuhan 1041 in hubei province and 1061 in china 8 meaning that there are few differences in prevalence between men and women however the crude case fatality rate for men 28 is slightly higher than that for women 17 8 however the relationship between ace2 expression level and sars-cov-2 infection rate and mortality remains unclear raas inhibitors including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor acei and angiotensin receptor blocker arb drugs are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension heart failure and myocardial inflammation they can control the level of ang ii in the body slow down the deterioration of inflammation and improve patient survival aceis and arbs can also exert their protective effects by activating the ace2angiotensin 1-7mas axis which may lead to increased ace2 in patients 5758 increased ace2 expression levels may lead to an increased risk of infection however there are no reports indicating that patients using aceisarbs are more likely to become infected whether acei  arb can be widely used in covid-19 patients with comorbid cardiovascular disease was unclear or even controversial 59 but recently guo et al reported that although more patients with higher troponin t tnt were using acei and arb medications owing to their baseline cvd their use was not associated with patients mortality rate 60 a research published in circulation research by zhang et al showed that among hospitalized covid-19 patients with hypertension inpatient use of acei  arb was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with acei  arb non-users 61 we can see that in-hospital use of acei  arb was not associated with an increased mortality risk there is no need for patients with hypertension to stop using acei  arb or switch to other antihypertensive medicine hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 35 were discovered in the 1960s and hcov-nl63 22 and hcov-hku1 26 were later discovered in upper respiratory tract infections asthma bronchiolitis and pneumonia there is evidence showing that infant elderly and immunocompromised patients are more likely to be infected with high mortality rates 3762 63 64 these infected patients are more likely develop severe disease states 65 66 67 68 varghese et al 37 retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 261 children with hcov infection including 229e hku1 nl63 oc43 and found that approximately 165 of the children had cardiovascular disease hcov-infected children with cardiovascular disease are more likely to receive respiratory support and enter a pediatric intensive care unit picu suggesting that the underlying cardiovascular disease increased the severity of hcov infection in the children cabea et al found that children with heart disease are more likely to be infected by hcovs 69 the presence of congenital heart disease was a significant risk factor for severe coronavirus infection in children who were less than five years old 70 table 1
 hypotension was found in a small number of patients with these four hcov infections 70 table 2
 there is no relevant evidence showing that hcov infection can cause heart injury however kim et al reported that hcovs were detected in children with kawasaki disease which is characterized by acute systemic vasculitis in childhood and may induce severe cardiovascular complications 71 serological tests suggest that hcov-229e may be involved in the occurrence of kawasaki disease 72 therefore we still need to pay attention to cardiovascular complications when facing these four kinds of hcov infection the severe acute respiratory syndrome 27 that broke out globally in 2003 is different from the human coronavirus described previously it is a severe acute respiratory infection with clinical manifestations of fever and dry cough with the lungs as the main locations of lesions some patients quickly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple organ failure with high mortality 73 74 75 76 77 there is much relevant evidence showing that pre-existing comorbid conditions are one of the major determinants of fatality 7678 79 80 81 82 83 it has been reported that the presence of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart disease is associated with adverse outcomes and mortality in sars patients 84 85 86 87 wong et al reviewed the medical records of fatal cases and found that 60 of the patients who died had comorbid conditions such as hypertension and coronary artery disease 88 chen et al found that patients with combined hypertension and cerebrovascular diseases are more likely to develop ards 89 another study by hu et al showed that the incidence rates of critical conditions and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome  mods  among sars patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were 18-fold and 19-fold higher than those of patients without underlying disease suggesting that cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are major risk factors for sars patients to devolve into critical conditions and mods and eventually lead to death 90 table 1 regarding the cardiovascular complications of sars patients it was found that sars patients had subclinical diastolic impairment without contraction involvement and this damage may be reversible upon clinical recovery 91 another study by yu et al found that cardiovascular complications including hypotension and tachycardia are common in sars patients but are usually self-limiting bradycardia and cardiac hypertrophy were less common and arrhythmias were rare 92 acute myocardial infarction can also be seen in a few sars patients 93 sars-cov was reported to be found in 40 718 patients of heart samples from patients who died of sars during the toronto outbreak 76 which might explain the myocardial damage discovered in sars patients 89 there are reports indicating that sars-cov also attacks small blood vessels throughout the body causing systemic vasculitis 94 table 2 in addition to clinical studies laboratory studies were performed to look for the pathophysiological mechanism associated with myocardial dysfunction caused by sars-cov infection 95 96 97 98 99 it was reported that pulmonary infection with sars-cov in mice led to a myocardial infection with a marked decrease in ace2 expression which may be responsible for the myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with sars 99 mers is a severe respiratory infectious disease caused by mers-cov that was first reported in saudi arabia in september 2012 29 the symptoms are similar to those of sars and severe cases can manifest as pneumonia with ards and other severe life-threatening complications such as septic shock acute myocarditis and multiple organ failure 100 101 102 103 104 105 the mortality rate of mers is 355 which is much higher than that of sars 10 39 it has been reported that people with underlying diseases such as diabetes cardiovascular disease renal failure obesity and immune deficiency are more likely to develop severe diseases after being infected with mers-cov 105106 badawi et al found that 50 of mers patients have diabetes and hypertension and that approximately 30 of patients have heart disease 107 they believed that these underlying disease conditions inhibit the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines damage the hosts natural and humoral immune systems and lead to an increased risk of severe mers complications another study found that 462 of the patients who died had hypertension suggesting that the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease increased the mortality of mers 108 banik suggested that sufficient attention should be paid to mers patients with combined underlying diseases to reduce the occurrence of serious complications and mortality 109 table 1 heart damage was also reported in mers patients 110 mers-cov was found in the kidneys of deceased patients but was not detected in the heart tissue and the heart showed no significant histological changes 111112 however an animal model study clearly stated that mers-cov rna could be seen in cardiac tissue implying direct cardiac pathology 113 the mechanism of heart injury in mers infection remains unclear and requires more research covid-19 which broke out at the end of 2019 is a disease caused by infection with sars-cov-2 124 similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 is a -cov 2 covid-19 is similar to sars and mers and manifests as extensively pathological viral lung inflammation 1 although similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 has its own characteristics 1114 early cases suggest that covid-19 may not be as severe as sars and mers however the rapidly increasing number of cases and increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission suggest that sars-cov-2 is more contagious than sars-cov and mers-cov and has a lower fatality 39115 116 117 up to april 27 2020 the overall mortality of covid-19 was 69 globally 5 but the fatality rate is different in different regions and times ranging from 07 to 135 5118 the symptoms of covid-19 infection appear after an incubation period of approximately 64 days 119 fever fatigue and dry cough are the main manifestations of covid-19 and a few patients have symptoms such as nasal congestion runny nose sore throat and diarrhea 29120121 patients with severe cases often experience dyspnea andor hypoxemia one week after onset 122 severe cases of covid-19 progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome septic shock and metabolic acidosis which is difficult to correct and coagulopathy 10 current case reports show that sars-cov-2 infection may have cardiovascular symptoms in addition to the typical respiratory symptoms a small number of patients have atypical clinical manifestations and may start with cardiovascular symptoms such as chest tightness palpitations and chest pain a study by liu et al found that 73 10137 of patients had palpitations as the first symptom 123 it was also reported that 2 of patients experienced chest pain during hospitalization 11 in addition wang et al found that 167 of patients with covid-19 had arrhythmias 10 according to relevant studies 9 10 11124 the proportion of covid-19 patients with comorbid cvds such as hypertension coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease was larger than that of patients with other comorbidities or without comorbidities suggesting that patients with cvd may be more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection moreover the incidence of cvd in patients with severe or fatal cases with covid-19 was higher than that in patients with nonsevere cases or in those who survived 1213124 according to the reports of the chinese center for disease control and prevention 157 of the deaths were hypertension and 9 had other cardiovascular diseases further suggesting that underlying cardiovascular diseases may be one of the important risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with covid-19 8 it can be seen not only that the number of covid-19 patients with cardiovascular disease is large but also that these patients have poor tolerance to severe pneumonia and are more likely to develop severe cases table 1 cardiac complications such as electrocardiography abnormities diastolic dysfunction and acute myocardial injury were reported in patients with covid-19 124 125 126 127 cases of severe myocarditis with reduced systolic function have been reported after covid-19 128 129 130 and sars-cov-2 infection-related myocarditis is likely associated with myocardial injury 60128 according to the study by li et al the most common organ damage outside the lungs was heart injury 13 serum myocardial necrosis markers such as hypersensitive troponin i hs-tni and creatine kinase ck increased to varying degrees in patients with mild and severe cases of covid-19 9 10 11 12 13 14131 132 133 134 however the risk of heart injury was higher in patients with severe cases approximately 222 to 31 912126133134 than in patients with mild cases approximately 2 to 4 910 the percentage of heart injury in covid-19 patients who died approximately 28 to 89 1213132 was higher than that in those who survived n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide nt-probnp levels were also reported to be increased 13134135 increased hs-tni and probnp expression levels may be risk factors for severe illness and high mortality of covid-19 133 134 135 furthermore it was found that high hs-tni levels were associated with increased levels of inflammation neutrophils il-6 crp and pct and decreased levels of immunity lymphocytes monocytes and cd4 and cd8  t cells suggesting that cardiac injury may have something to do with the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response 131132 table 2 two recent studies published in jama cardiology reported the cardiovascular complications of covid-19 in detail 60136 shi et al found that cardiac injury was a common condition among hospitalized patients with covid-19 in wuhan china and it is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality 136 guo et al reported that myocardial injury was significantly associated with fatal outcome of covid-19 myocardial injury was associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury 60 table 2 covid-19 may induce new cardiovascular diseases and  or aggravate potential cardiovascular diseases the short-term and long-term cardiovascular effects of covid-19 and the effects of specific treatments are unclear and need further investigation as the epidemic spread sars-cov-2 evolved multiple subtypes in a recent study researchers proposed the subdivision of the global sars-cov-2 population into sixteen well-defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural nsp3 nsp4 nsp6 nsp12 nsp13 and nsp14 cistrons structural spike and nucleocapsid and accessory orf8 genes 137 six virus subtypes were predominant in the population accounting for more than 97 of the samples isolated from around the world and the subtypes showed some geographical structure with two clusters a smaller one comprised of isolates mostly sampled from western hemisphere subtypes ii vi ix x and xi and a larger one whose isolates were sampled from western and eastern hemispheres subtypes i iii iv v vii viii xii xiii xiv xv and xvi 137 the researchers believed that the genetic structure determined for the sars-cov-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs 137 in another earlier study population genetic analyses of 103 sars-cov-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types designated l and s that are well defined by two different single nucleotide polymorphisms snps 138 the l type 70 is more prevalent than the s type 30 but the s type was found to be the ancestral version the l type is more aggressive and spread more quickly and it was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in wuhan but the frequency of the l type decreased after early january 2020 for more severe selective pressure placed by human intervention on the l type 138 contrary to the l type the s-type which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive might have increased in relative frequency due to the weaker selective pressure 138 it was also reported that among the 27 viruses isolated from wuhan 26 963 were l type and only 1 37 was s type 138 however among the other 73 viruses isolated outside wuhan 45 616 were l type and 28 384 were s type 138 this comparison suggests that the l type was significantly more prevalent in wuhan than in other places and recent studies about the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with covid-19 in wuhan 9 10 11139 or outside wuhan 134140141have showed that the mortality of covid-19 patients and the proportion of patients with cardiac injury outside wuhan was lower than that in wuhan table 3
 although there were many reasons for the different incidence of cardiac injury and outcome of covid-19 in and outside wuhan such as the shortage of medical resources in wuhan the role of different sars-cov-2 subtypes cannot be ignored the relationship between sars-cov-2 subtypes and the mortality of covid-19 or the cvd complications need for further immediate comprehensive studies that combine genomic data epidemiological data and records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 according to the references above we can see that patients with underlying cvd may be more likely to become infected with coronavirus and cvd may be one of the risk factors for poor prognosis and high mortality of cov infection few studies however have explored the mechanisms underlying these associations we believe that the possible mechanisms may be related to inflammation cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are all metabolic-related diseases it has been reported that metabolic syndrome can downregulate the key mediator of the hosts innate immune response to pathogenesis affecting the function of the innate and humoral immune systems 142 chronic low-grade inflammatory disease has been widely recognized as a feature of coronary heart disease and its occurrence is closely related to inflammation 143 the occurrence of hypertension is associated with oxidative stress inflammation and the activation of the immune system 144 il-6 il-1 and tumor necrosis factor  tnf- levels are higher in patients with hypertension than in patients with normal blood pressure 145 this may explain why patients with underlying cardiovascular disease found in the clinic are more susceptible to infection kulcsar et al showed that mers-cov infection can lead to prolonged respiratory tract inflammation immune cell dysfunction and changes in the expression profile of inflammatory mediators 146 lymphopenia and increased inflammatory mediators were found in sars-cov-2 infection 147 immune disorders caused by sars-cov infection have also been reported 148 these may lead to the exacerbation of the original cardiovascular disease which is related to the death of some patients found in the clinic due to heart failure 88103132 according to information released by the shanghai municipal health and family planning commission the first covid-19 death in shanghai was in an individual who was 88 years old with a severe history of hypertension and cardiac insufficiency an analysis of the cause of death suggested that the patient died of heart failure and systemic multiple organ dysfunction therefore sars-cov-2 infection was just an inducement for exacerbations 124 overall the heart and lungs are inseparable in the normal physiological functions of the human body on the one hand comorbidities and complications of the heart increase the risk of pneumonia infection and exacerbation on the other hand pneumonia infection may aggravate existing cardiovascular diseases such as increased blood pressure increased heart failure and the recurrence of myocardial infarction fever is a common symptom in patients with coronavirus infection 927149 fever promotes the immune functions of humans and some animals and decreases the pathogenicity of some microbes antibody production t-cell activation neutrophil function and macrophage oxidative metabolism have been reported to increase in the presence of fever 150 151 152 153 154 however to avoid excessively elevated body temperature affecting normal physiological functions the body will activate sympathetic nerves and regulate circulatory function which will increase the heart rate and cardiac output 155 an increase in heart rate over a long period of time will lead to increased myocardial oxygen consumption and decreased cardiac output which may cause ischemia or heart failure 156 many diseases with fever symptoms may be complicated by myocarditis such as spotted fever rickettsioses infection 157 severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome 158 drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms 159 dengue 160 161 162 complicated scrub typhus 163 herpes simplex virus infection 164 enteric fever 165 a decrease in cardiac function may occur in febrile illnesses but whether myocardial damage is due to fever or the underlying infection is not known 166 weissinger et al found that in pigs with a bacterial infection with elevated body temperature serum ck lactate dehydrogenase ld and gamma-globulin gg levels were increased the administration of antibiotics to these pigs and lowering their body temperature reduced ck and ld levels but gg levels remained elevated suggesting that the infection did not decrease this study indicated that the levels of ck and ld were elevated due to fever caused by infection 167 k l et al discovered that a longer duration of fever was related to the occurrence of pericarditis after myocardial infarction 168 therefore heart injury in coronavirus infection may be related to fever severe pneumonia can cause significant gas exchange disturbances and lead to hypoxemia hypoxia reduces the energy production required for cell metabolism and increases the bodys anaerobic digestion acidosis and oxygen free radicals accumulated in the cell destroy the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane as hypoxia continues the intracellular calcium ion concentration increases significantly leading to a series of cell damage processes including apoptosis 169 at the same time hypoxia can also induce inflammatory reactions such as the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the release of cytokines leading to further tissue ischemia and may even cause myocardial infarction 13170171 previous lessons from coronavirus and influenza have shown that viral infections can cause acute coronary syndrome 172173 arrhythmia 174 and exacerbation of heart failure 175 mainly due to a combination of significant systemic inflammation response and localized vascular inflammation at the arterial plaque along with other effects 176 177 178 evidence has shown that sars-cov induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 mcp-1 transforming growth factor-beta 1 tgf-beta1 tnf il-1 and il-6 and interferon- ifn- in sars patients and experimental animal models infected with sars-cov 179180 tnf and il-1 family and il-6 family cytokines are considered proinflammatory mediators of heart failure and they have obvious negative inotropic effects which may explain heart failure complications in sars infection 181 the acute heart injury might be due to the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response to sars infection 30 there is evidence indicating that myocardial inflammation induced by sars-cov is mainly mediated by macrophages and the resultant production of chemokines 9596 the nuclear factor-b nf-b signaling pathway associated with the induction of proinflammatory cytokines is activated in sars-cov-infected mice treatment with drugs that inhibited nf-b activation led to a reduction in inflammation in both sars-cov-infected cultured cells and mice and significantly increased mouse survival after sars-cov infection indicating that the activation of the nf-b signaling pathway represents a major contribution to the inflammation induced after sars-cov infection and that nf-b inhibitors are promising antivirals in infections caused by sars-cov and potentially other pathogenic human coronaviruses 182 sars-cov-2 appears to affect themyocardium and cause myocarditis 128 myocardial injury is likely associated with infection-related myocarditis andor ischemia 60 increases in inflammatory factors such as crp il-1 and il-6 were also discovered in sars-cov-2 infection 131132147 wu et al believed that sars-cov-2 may cause heart damage by the cytokine storm 131 evidence has shown that sars-cov-2 may mainly affect t lymphocytes especially cd4  t cells resulting in a significant decrease in lymphocyte numbers 183 the extent of lymphopenia and an increase in inflammatory cytokines are related to the severity of the disease 147 critically ill covid-19 patients had higher levels of il6 il10 tnf lactate dehydrogenase ldh and c-reactive protein than patients with mild covid-19 9139184 suggesting that inflammatory indicators are an important factor in the early diagnosis of severe covid-19 most patients with coronavirus infection are in an inflammatory state which places the patients in a hypercoagulable state for example covid-19 leads to an increase in d-dimer levels in 40 of patients a decrease in activated partial thromboplastin time aptt in 16 of patients and a decrease in pt in 30 of patients further increasing the risk of embolism 11 hypercoagulability induced by inflammation might contribute to plaque rupture with subsequent thrombosis and myocardial injury 185 therefore clinicians should pay attention to covid-19 patients with coronary heart disease to prevent myocardial injury and myocardial infarction septic shock can be seen as a serious complication in sars mers and covid-19 1376103 approximately 62 of sars-cov-2 infections are complicated by shock 126 it was reported that left ventricular dysfunction occurs in approximately 20 of patients within 6 hours after the onset of septic shock and the incidence can increase to 60 by 1 to 3 days after the onset of septic shock 186 myocardial dysfunction and cardiovascular inflammation might lead to elevated creatine kinase and troponin 187 which might explain the high hs-tni in deceased patients in addition to the abovementioned accompanying symptoms anxiety and stress can also lead to adverse reactions such as accelerated heart rhythms and elevated blood pressure especially in critically ill patients 188189 health anxiety could be found in coronavirus-infected patients 190 generally everyone experiences health anxiety to some degree and the associated vigilance to a potential health-related threat can be protective however excessive health anxiety can be detrimental 190 the literature indicates that stress can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system leading to an increase in peripheral glucocorticoid and catecholamine levels 191 high plasma catecholamine levels are associated with an increased risk of heart failure altered autonomic activity during depression can lead to arrhythmias the activated sns alters cardiac wall contractility and increases apoptotic pathways in cardiomyocytes contributing to cvd development although there is no relevant study on covid-19 patients suffering from anxiety medical workers have been reported to be anxious after direct contact with the patients 192193 a study by sun et al showed that some chinese showed acute posttraumatic stress symptoms during the covid-19 outbreak 194 therefore psychological counseling should be conducted on patients in a timely manner and anxiolytic drugs could be used when necessary as mentioned above sars-cov was reported to lead to myocardial infection with a marked decrease in ace2 expression which may be responsible for myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with sars 99 direct sars-cov infection of cardiomyocytes may also lead to myocarditis and impaired myocardial function coronavirus-induced myocarditis and its subsequent progression to dilated cardiomyopathy have been described in rabbit models 195 sars-cov was found in heart samples from patients who died of sars 76 pathological findings showed a marked increase in macrophage infiltration in patients with sars-cov in the heart with evidence of myocardial damage mers-cov was not detected in the heart tissue and the heart showed no significant histological changes in mers patients 111112 however an animal model study clearly stated that mers-cov rna could be seen in cardiac tissue implying direct cardiac pathology 113 although myocarditis was reported in sporadic autopsy cases 128 there is still no clear pathological evidence supporting that sars-cov-2 can directly cause heart damage the most frequently used drugs during hospitalization are glucocorticoids and antiviral drugs as well as antibiotics the secondary qt interval prolongation caused by the use of drugs during hospitalization cannot be ignored antiviral drugs lopinavir ritonavir antibiotics azithromycin moxifloxacin levofloxacin antifungal drugs glucocorticoids and some antiarrhythmic drugs there is a potential risk of prolonging the qtc interval 196197 drug-associated qt prolongation is associated with increased arrhythmic and non-arrhythmic mortality and it therefore continues to be an important metric of drug safety 198 a small study in france enrolling 26 treated patients and 16 non-randomized controls showed that hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin shortened the time to resolution of viral shedding of covid-19 199 based on this study clinicians in many countries have begun using these medications in clinical practice and multiple randomized trials are being initiated but there were occasional case reports of hydroxychloroquine prolonging the qt interval and provoking torsade de pointes when used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus 200 201 202 203 the widely used antibiotic azithromycin was gradually recognized as a rare cause of prolonged qt severe arrhythmia and increased risk of sudden death 204 205 206 207 although there were no reports of arrhythmia death caused by the use of hydroxychloroquine the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin should also be noted 208 active support with expected management based on early prognostic indicators may improve recovery appropriate treatment of heart failure arrhythmia acute coronary syndrome and thrombosis are still important with continued global cooperation on multiple methods specific evidence-based treatment strategies for covid-19 will emerge in order to protect the wider population antibody testing and effective vaccines will be needed to make a history of covid-19 and some treatment related issues need attention firstly the use of acei  arb drugs was controversial in the earlier phase of covid-19 epidemic but recently published studies suggested that there is no need for patients with hypertension to stop using acei  arb or switch to other antihypertensive medicine 6061209 some conjectures 210 based on the disease mechanism in the early stage of the outbreak that acei  arb may increase the infection of new coronavirus and the aggravation of covid-19 by increasing the expression of ace2 have been denied by more and more clinical evidence we see that the continuous treatment of covid-19 patients with hypertension with acei  arb will not only cause the deterioration of the condition but also continue to exert cardiovascular protection and even improve the prognosis 6061209 secondly we should pay attention to the application of hydroxychloroquine 200 201 202 203 and azithromycin 204 205 206 207 for their side effects of prolonging the qt interval other drugs used to treat the covid-19 patients such as antiviral drugs lopinavir ritonavir antibiotics moxifloxacin levofloxacin antifungal drugs glucocorticoids and some antiarrhythmic drugs can cause the qt interval prolongation and should attract more attention reference by sapp et al would help to minimize risk of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmia during treatment of covid-19 211 thirdly a recent study from jama reported that the mortality rate of patients with mechanical ventilation treatment was 881 212 multiple studies around the world have shown that the mortality rate of covid-19 patients using ventilator was still high 213 214 215 and it was believed that the ventilator should be used more cautiously in patients with covid-19 which can reduce the mortality of patients using the ventilator by more than 50 216 new guidelines should be established for when to use a ventilator for patients with covid-19 we advocate the application of staged breathing support methods to delay the use of ventilator simple oxygen treatment like nasal oxygen supply may be safer and more effective fourth methylprednisolone are the classical immunosuppressive drugs which are important to stop or delay the progress of the pneumonia and have been proved to be effective for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in recent study 217 wu at al found that the administration of methylprednisolone appeared to reduce the risk of death in covid-19 patients with ards however of those who received methylprednisolone treatment 23 of 50 patients died this is a rather high mortality of 50 the indication timing dosage and duration the application of methylprednisolone needs further investigation fifth the early report showed that remdesivir was highly effective in the control of sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 218 but recent study published in lancet showed that remdesivir did not reduce the mortality of covid-19 patients 219 however another clinical trial showed that remdesivir accelerates recovery from advanced covid-19 220 another clinical trial showed that there was no significant difference in clinical outcome between the 5-day and 10-day course of remdesivir 221 these data suggested remdesivir does not reduce the mortality of covid-19 patients but have an effect on shortening the course of disease in mild patients and early medication may be better the application of remdesivir needs further researches clinical data indicate that comorbid cardiovascular disease will aggravate the severity of coronavirus infection leading to a poor prognosis coronavirus may cause myocardial injury and the prognosis of patients with complicated myocardial injury is poor the mechanism of coronavirus causing myocardial injury and drug treatment options remain to be further studied this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectors the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work  molecular characterization of a canine coronavirus na09 strain detected in a dogs organs vasileios ntafis eftychia xylouri viviana mari maria papanastassopoulou nikolaos papaioannou angelos thomas canio buonavoglia nicola decaro   canine coronavirus ccov is a member of the virus family coronaviridae order nidovirales it is a large enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna virus the genome consists of two overlapping open reading frames orf1a and 1b translated into a polyprotein precursor of the rna-dependent rna polymerase and several orfs encoding structural spike membrane envelope and nucleocapsid protein and non-structural proteins 3a 3b 3c 7a and 7b 14 18 to date two different genotypes of ccov have been recognized ccov type i ccov-i and ccov type ii ccov-ii 10 furthermore recently ccov-ii was divided in two subtypes ccov-iia and ccov-iib with the second of these arising as a result of a putative recombination event between ccov-ii and transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev 12 13 recently ccov tgev and feline coronavirus fcov were included in the same species alphacoronavirus 1 of the new genus alphacoronavirus 2 ccov is the causative agent of enteritis in dogs with infection being restricted to the intestinal tract although ccov is characterized by low mortality and systemic infections are not usual 10 in 2005 a highly pathogenic ccov strain cb05 was detected in an outbreak of a fatal systemic disease in puppies the virus was isolated from faeces as well as various parenchymatous organ samples from the dogs 1 in addition the disease was reproduced after experimental infection of dogs with young puppies being more severely affected 11 sequencing and phylogenetic analysis have demonstrated that cb05 belongs to the ccov-iia subtype which includes all classical canine coronavirus strains with a deletion in orf3b being proposed as a possible genetic marker for the pantropic nature of the strain 10 recently recombinant ccov-iib strains were also detected in organs of dogs though after experimental infection no systemic signs or virus dissemination through the blood were observed implying differences in pathobiology among ccov-iia pantropic variants and ccov-iib strains 12 23 in greece the presence of ccov was recently reported for the first time in a severe outbreak of enteritis in a kennel by sequence and phylogenetic analysis high similarity to the pantropic cb05 strain in the most variable region of the s gene was demonstrated 22 in the present study the molecular characterization and sequence analysis findings of a ccov-iia pantropic strain as well as the need for new genetic markers are reported in april 2009 a dead 10-week-old maltese 1309 male dog was submitted for laboratory investigation coming from a pet shop in thessaloniki a city in northern greece the dog presented inappetence depression severe haemorrhagic diarrhoea vomiting and hypothermia following fever leading to death one day after the onset of the symptoms the puppy had been vaccinated with a single dose of a vaccine against canine parvovirus and canine distemper virus three weeks before the onset of the symptoms during necropsy examination linear haemorrhages of the intestinal wall haemorrhagic enteritis and an ulcerated duodenum were observed multiple areas of emphysema and congestion were found at the lungs the liver was enlarged friable and yellow-brown in color with multifocal discolored spots congested vessels in the dura mater of the brain were also observed faecal and parenchymatous organ samples were tested using molecular diagnostic assays described previously for common canine viral pathogens eg ccov 3 canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 4 6 7 canine distemper virus cdv 15 and canine adenovirus type 1 and type 2 cav-1 and cav-2 17 for ccov typing quantitation and subtyping in faecal and organ samples two real-time rt-pcr assays 5 and two rt-pcr assays 13 were carried out the lung of the dead pup was homogenised 10 wv in d-mem together with antibiotics penicillin 1000 iuml streptomycin 100 gml and inoculated into canine fibroma a-72 cells infected cells were monitored daily for the occurrence of cytopathic effect cpe and after five days of incubation they were tested for ccov antigen by an immunofluorescence if assay using a cat polyclonal serum specific for members of the species alphacoronavirus 1 and a goat anti-cat igg conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate sigma aldrich usa the 3 end of the genome of the ccov-iia na09 strain was amplified as described previously using viral rna extracted from the spleen superscript one-step rt-pcr for long templates invitrogen srl italy and six rt-pcr assays specific for overlapping fragments encompassing orfs 2 3a 3b 3c 4 5 6 7a and 7b 9 the nucleotide sequence was determined in both directions for each fragment pcr amplicons were sequenced by a commercial facility beckman coulter genomics united kingdom sequence assembly and analysis were carried out using the bioedit software package 16 and the national center for

method 24 ccov rna was detected in the faeces lungs spleen kidneys pancreas heart liver and brain of the dead puppy using genotype-specific real-time rt-pcr assays both genotypes ccov-i and ccov-ii 53  103 and 613  105 rna copiesl of template respectively were detected in the faeces while only ccov-ii was detected in all organ samples in detail ccov-ii was detected in liver 511  103 rna copiesl of template spleen 106  105 rna copiesl of template pancreas 703  101 rna copiesl of template kidney 121  103 rna copiesl of template lungs 768  104 rna copiesl of template heart 82  104 rna copiesl of template and brain 203  102 rna copiesl of template regarding subtype characterization the ccov-ii strain detected in faecal and in all organ samples was characterized as ccov-iia despite several attempts the virus was not adapted to growth in vitro as demonstrated by the absence of cytopathic effect in inoculated cells and by negative results in the if assay even after three passages on cell cultures regarding other canine viral pathogens the dog tested positive for a cpv-2a field strain a total of 8809 nucleotides were determined for strain na09 encompassing orfs 2 s protein 3a 3b 3c 4 e protein 5 m protein 6 n protein 7a and 7b alignment of an 8767-nucleotide part of the sequence with tgev ccov and fcov reference strains available in genbank showed the highest identity to ccov-iia pantropic reference strain cb05 dq112226 977 the minimum conserved signal for transcription ctaaac was present upstream of all of the orfs orf 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 the spike protein gene was 4365 nucleotides long encoding a protein of 1454 amino acids when compared to strain cb05 no insertions or deletions were observed the spike protein of na09 when compared with the analogous proteins of ccov tgev and fcov reference strains showed the highest similarity to cb05 982 aa table 1 analysis using the netnglyk 10 server showed that the protein contained a putative signal peptide cleavage sites at positions ser 19 to thr 20 as in strain cb05 and a transmembrane domain positions 1394 - 1416 of the s gene the s protein contained 31 potential n-linked glycosylation sites phylogenetic analysis revealed that the greek strain was more closely related to the cb05 pantropic reference strain detected in dogs organs fig 1

 the genomic region located between the s and e genes of both strains was found to encode three presumptive non-structural proteins nsp3a 3b and 3c proteins were 78 71 and 244 amino acids long respectively regarding orf3b the 38-nucleotide deletion of the cb05 was not observed fig 2
 the envelope protein was found to be 82 amino acids in length like in most canine coronavirus strains a transmembrane domain was predicted between residue 15 and 37 the greek strain had 100 amino acid identity to cb05 and to two ccov-iib strains detected in dogs organs 11908 and 34105 the membrane protein m protein was found to be 262 amino acids long it contained three potential n-linked glycosylation sites a putative signal peptide cleavage sites at positions gly 16 to glu 17 and three transmembrane domains positions 47-69 76-98 and 113-135 the m protein had the highest amino acid sequence identity to those of the ccov-iib reference strains 11908 and 43007 and to that of cb05 996 and 992 respectively the n protein nucleoprotein was found to be 382 amino acids in length the greek strain shared the highest amino acid identity with ccov-iib 11908 and cb05 997 and 994 respectively orf7 of both strains was found to encode two presumptive non-structural proteins nsp7a and 7b were 101 and 213 amino acids in length and they were conserved with respect to the ccov-ii reference strains coronaviruses are characterized by high genetic diversity the high frequency of mutations due to the high rate of mistakes of the rna-dependent rna polymerase as well as frequent recombination are considered the main mechanisms of coronaviruses evolution leading to the emergence of new strains subtypes and genotypes within species and changes regarding tissue or even host tropism 26 in the present study a ccov strain spreading to the internal organs was detected and analysed by molecular techniques by means of sequence and phylogenetic analysis a high similarity to the pantropic cb05 variant was shown this study the second one reporting the genetic characterization of a ccov pantropic strain suggests that pantropic ccov variants are present in greece and can be associated with fatal disease in puppies 9 however the observed mortality could be due to the dual cpvpantropic ccov infection considering that mixed infections usually display a more severe course and higher mortality 8 in addition recent studies have demonstrated that the outcome of cb05 infection is not invariably lethal but at least under experimental conditions its main consequence is represented by a profound long-lasting lymphopenia involving both b and t cells 20 by means of real-time rt-pcr the tissue distribution of na09 was determined viral rna was detected in several parenchymatous organs and in high concentration suggesting the pantropic nature of the variant detection and quantitation of the viral rna in the heart and the pancreas is reported for the first time the detection of ccov-i which was restricted to the faecal samples suggests that the pantropic na09 strain has the advantage of disseminating in the organism revealing differences in the pathobiology of the pantropic variants with respect to common ccov enteric strains regarding ccov mutations are considered to play a key role in the emergence of the pantropic variant cb05 9 the truncated form of orf3b observed in cb05 was not present in na09 that mutation was considered to be a possible genetic marker for pantropic variants 9 however similar deletions in orf3b have been observed in common enteric strains as in 1-71 fig 2 19 and truncated nsp3b has been associated with attenuated coronavirus strains 25 on the other hand a high similarity in the s protein was observed between na09 and cb05 strains since the s protein is responsible for receptor attachment and changes in tissue tropism have been associated with mutations in the s gene 18 21 it is likely that specific genetic markers for pantropic strains will be identified in this region in conclusion in the present study the detection quantitation and molecular analysis of a pantropic ccov variant is reported in addition it is suggested that pantropic variants can be identified in the heart and the pancreas the emergence of strains that are able to disseminate and cause systemic infection suggests that canine coronaviral infections may be more interesting and severe than thought in the past further studies are necessary in order to determine the circulation of pantropic ccov strains among the dog population and to identify specific genetic markers that can be useful for understanding virus pathobiology and epidemiology  prevalence of cryptosporidium parvum in dairy calves and gp60 subtyping of diarrheic calves in central argentina joaqun lombardelli a mariela tomazic l leonhard schnittger karina tiranti i   cryptosporidium spp is an apicomplexan enteropathogen of a wide range of vertebrate hosts including humans cryptosporidial infection is common in calves and could cause severe diarrhea lethargy anorexia and dehydration leading to substantial economic losses mainly related to reductions in weight gain and the application of palliative and preventive treatments although calves with cryptosporidiosis may recover after 46 weeks olson et al 2004 a mortality rate of 355 in younger animals than 30 days has also been reported singh et al 2006 high herd prevalence of cryptosporidium spp has been reported in dairies with values ranging from 505 to 96 hamnes et al 2006 brook et al 2008 trotz-williams et al 2008 silverls et al 2009 tiranti et al 2011 smith et al 2014 delafosse et al 2015 al mawly et al 2015 it has been reported that cryptosporidiosis risk is higher in calves younger than 30 days old tiranti et al 2011 smith et al 2014 delafosse et al 2015 avendao et al 2018 mainly four cryptosporidium species have been reported in cattle cryptosporidium parvum cryptosporidium bovis cryptosporidium andersoni and cryptosporidium ryanae santn et al 2008 ryan et al 2014 among them c parvum and c bovis are the most common species identified in pre-weaned calves c parvum can be transmitted to humans via the fecaloral route following direct or indirect contact with infected animals ryan et al 2014 kinross et al 2015 cattle are recognized as a major parasite reservoir and contributor of zoonotic infection because c parvum subtypes infecting humans have been isolated from cattle xiao and fayer 2008 c parvum is an important zoonotic pathogen responsible for serious human diarrhea outbreaks in industrialized countries affecting especially immunocompromised individuals hiv patients children and the elderly xiao and feng 2008 in developing countries cryptosporidium infection has been found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of deaths in toddlers with diarrhea aged 1223 months kotloff et al 2013 molecular tools have allowed to define and assess the genetic diversity of cryptosporidium facilitating the quest to unravel transmission patterns and associated impacts on public health thompson and ash 2016 in order to assess a possible transmission source of c parvum intraspecific subtyping based on the 60 kda glycoprotein gp60 gene is commonly used xiao 2010 accordingly identification of cryptosporidium intraspecific variation has been central in understanding transmission dynamics of zoonotic parasite strains molecular characterization of c parvum at the subtype level in dairy calves important to determine zoonotic potential have been conducted in several countries santn et al 2008 xiao and fayer 2008 amer et al 2010 silverls et al 2013 smith et al 2014 kaupke and rzeutka 2015 in argentina two previous studies have reported c parvum as the only species present in 120 pre-weaned dairy calves and subtypes iiaa16g1r1 iiaa17g1r1 iiaa18g1r1 iiaa19g1r1 iiaa20g1r1 iiaa21g1r1 iiaa22g1r1 and iiaa23g1r1 have been identified tomazic et al 2013 del coco et al 2014 whereas an association between subtypes and different clinical manifestations has been demonstrated in humans few studies have tested the hypothesis that c parvum-subtypes are associated with diarrhea intensity in dairy calves cama et al 2007 insulander et al 2013 adamu et al 2014 the aim of this study was to determine i cryptosporidium prevalence in calves herds and within-herd and ii the presence of cryptosporidium species and c parvum subtypes in calves with diarrhea from intensive dairy farms in central argentina a cross-sectional study was carried out between april 2013 and march 2014 in the dairy area located in general san martn district crdoba argentina fig 1 supplementary table 1 this area included 564 dairy herds indec 2008 of which the herd size of 68 range from 101 to 500 cows snchez et al 2012 farms were selected from a database of the producers rural association registered in the local execution unit villa mara general san martn district in crdoba argentina the inclusion criterion for dairy farms was a size of 101 to 300 cows as based on january 2013 data based on sample size calculations a total of 60 farms were required to estimate a 193 prevalence with 9 precision and were randomly selected from 365 dairies epidat 31 exclusively calves younger than 60 days of age were sampled individual fecal samples were taken directly from the rectum using sterile plastic gloves and were stored at 4 to 8 c until processing at the moment of sample collection feces consistency and presence of diarrhea were registered fecal consistency was scored as follows solid s semisolid ss liquid l runny r and meconium m diarrhea was defined as runny or liquid feces mcguirk 2008 samples were processed with the formol-ether concentration technique young et al 1979 the supernatant was removed leaving a final pellet volume of 2 ml fecal smears were prepared with 50 l of each pellet presence of cryptosporidium oocysts was detected by microscopic examination at  1000 magnification using the modified ziehl-neelsen technique henriksen and pohlenz 1981 fig 2 intensity of cryptosporidium infection was scored semi-quantitatively according to the average number of oocysts in 20 randomly selected fields as follows 0 no oocysts 1 15 oocysts 2 610 oocysts 3 1115 oocysts and 4  16 oocysts chartier et al 2013 all tests were performed by one person cryptosporidium oocysts were concentrated from oocyst-positive fecal samples using the sucrose flotation protocol of coklin et al 2007 oocysts were ruptured with three freeze-thaw cycles and total dna was extracted with the qiamp dna stool mini kit qiagen hilden germany following the instructions of the manufacturer for species determination genomic dna isolated from oocyst-positive fecal samples were subjected to pcr-rflp as described in xiao et al 1999 including the use of an additional restriction enzyme mboii feng et al 2007 for subtyping c parvum isolates were selected from calves with diarrhea and high infection intensity scores 3 and 4 and the pcr amplicon of the gene encoding the 60 kda glycoprotein gp60 was directly sequenced and subtyped alves et al 2003 gp60 subtypes were designated based on the number of trinucleotides tca and tcg and the hexanucleotide acatca in the polymorphic tandem repeat region sulaiman et al 2005 nucleotide sequences were deposited in the genbank database under accession numbers kx768771-kx768816 cryptosporidium parvum overall herd and within-herd prevalence was calculated for all calves a chi-square test 2 was used to compare the frequency of c parvum infection in diarrheic and healthy animals and to assess the association between calf age and the occurrence of c parvum subtype-infection all analyses were performed with the statistical software r 323 from the 60 herds selected six were excluded since three farms had incorrect contact data two farms send their calves to a collective artificial breeding system and one farm had sold all animals at the time of the study altogether a total of 1073 fecal samples were collected in the remaining 54 dairy herds corresponding to an average of 20 samples per herd range 10 to 66 of all sampled calves 22 2361073 presented diarrhea 95 ci 195 245 of 1073 sampled calves 282 263 were positive for oocysts excretion after microscopic examination prevalence of oocyst excretion for calves of one two three and four or more weeks of age was found to be 119 12101 462 141305 295 99336 and 9 30331 respectively genomic dna was isolated from oocyst-positive samples and subjected to pcr-rflp for cryptosporidium species determination eight samples with a low infection intensity score 1 failed to amplify whereas the pcr-rflp pattern of the remaining 274 samples identified c parvum resulting in a prevalence of 255 95 ci 229 281 in the study area of the 274 c parvum-positive samples 35 96 displayed a low score 1 41 113 a medium score 2 13 36 a high score 3 and 11 29 a very high score 4 infection intensity with regard of feces consistency 17 63372 of c parvum-positive calves displayed feces that had been graded to be of solid s 24 104432 semisolid ss 44 3989 liquid l 45 66147 runny r and 6 233 meconium m consistency in 48 of 54 herds at least one c parvum positive calf was identified resulting in an overall herd prevalence of 89 c parvum within-herd prevalence was lower ranging from 0 to 57 mean 25 first quartile 147 third quartile 36 and in 50 of herds c parvum within-herd prevalence was higher than average fig 3 diarrhea was absent in six herds in three of these no oocysts were detected while in the three remaining only one or two c parvum-positive calves with a low infection intensity score 1 were found from 65 c parvum-positive calves exhibiting a high score 3 and very high infection intensity score 4 47 samples of diarrheal calves were selected for amplification and gp60 gene sequencing all analyzed c parvum gp60 subtypes belonged to the iia family altogether five c parvum gp60 subtypes iiaa18g1r1 iiaa20g1r1 iiaa21g1r1 iiaa22g1r1 and iiaa24g1r1 could be identified table 1 interestingly in all gp60 alleles a non-synonymous nucleotide exchange from gac to ggc was observed corresponding to an exchange of asn to gly at amino acid site 99 as previously reported tomazic et al 2013 a highly significant association was found between diarrhea presence and c parvum infection 2  5589 p  0001 supplementary table 2 the predominant subtype in calves with diarrhea and high infection intensity was iiaa20g1r1 2547 followed by iiaa18g1r1 1247 additionally a novel subtype iiaa24g1r1 was determined in two calves no statistically significant relationship was found between calf age and a specific subtype presence p  049 supplementary table 3 nevertheless particular subtypes were present only in animals of a certain age for example iiaa21g1r1 iiaa22g1r1 and iiaa24g1r1 subtypes were observed only in animals of 2 weeks of age or less in contrast the iiaa18g1r1 subtype was found exclusively in calves 2 weeks of age or older while the most predominant subtype iiaa20g1r1 was identified in all ages furthermore all subtypes were found to be not clustered but individually distributed in different dairy herds supplementary table 4 cryptosporidium parvum infection in calves is widespread brook et al 2008 trotz-williams et al 2008 al mawly et al 2015 qi et al 2015 and also in the present study c parvum was in agreement with previous reports in argentina the only species identified in calves tomazic et al 2013 del coco et al 2014 however in contrast to previous studies done in argentina a considerably higher overall prevalence was found del coco et al 2008 tiranti et al 2011 garro et al 2016 probably due to an additional oocysts concentration step prior to microscopic examination significantly increasing the sensitivity of oocyst detection in the present study the sampling fraction of calves  30 days of age was 83 8881073 which is the age range were c parvum is most frequently found santn et al 2008 xiao 2010 ryan et al 2014 delafosse et al 2015 found that a high infection intensity scores 3 or 4 predicted an increased mortality rate of calves 90 days of age based on this finding it is anticipated that 237 of oocyst-excreting calves or 61 of the studied calves in the present study may be subjected to an increased mortality at least one c parvum-positive calf was detected in 89 of the herds studied highly variable herd prevalence ranging from 505 to 96 have been reported hamnes et al 2006 brook et al 2008 trotz-williams et al 2008 silverls et al 2009 tiranti et al 2011 smith et al 2014 al mawly et al 2015 delafosse et al 2015 garro et al 2016 avendao et al 2018 similar to the considerable differences of overall prevalence that have been reported corresponding dissimilarities in herd prevalence may likewise be attributed to the different sensitivities of applied diagnostic test accordingly garro et al 2016 estimated a herd prevalence of 67 overall prevalence 163 compared with 89 overall prevalence 263 in the present study other factors that may bias towards lower herd prevalence values maybe the sampling of a smaller age range or a higher number of older animals 3060 days in addition also a lower number of calves sampled in each herd may significantly reduce the probability of finding positive calves particularly in herds with very low prevalence since only one fecal sample from each calf was examined the true prevalence value may have been underestimated in the present study diarrhea was not observed in 6 herds 3 of which tested negative for all animals interestingly the 3 remaining herds presented 1 or 2 c parvum positive calves with low infection intensity score score 1 a highly significant association was found between the presence of diarrhea and c parvum infection reinforcing the notion that this enteropathogen is most relevant for diarrhea development in neonatal dairy calves izzo et al 2011 al mawly et al 2015 meganck et al 2015 garro et al 2017 nevertheless the association of c parvum with diarrhea may be overestimated since possible co-infections with other microorganisms were not evaluated noteworthy a novel subtype iiaa24g1r1 could be identified in two different calves of the same herd both animals showed profuse diarrhea high-level of dehydration and though treated eventually died further laboratory testing excluded salmonella spp enteropathogenic e coli epec enterotoxigenic e coli etec rotavirus and coronavirus as primary cause of death data not shown besides the novel iiaa24g1r1 subtype the remaining 4 subtypes reported in this study have been previously detected in argentina high genetic variability has been found in dairy calves in argentina tomazic et al 2013 reported the six subtypes iiaa17g1r1 iiaa18g1r1 iiaa20g1r1 iiaa21g1r1 iiaa22g1r1 and iiaa23g1r1 from 45 dairy calves del coco et al 2014 described the seven subtypes iiaa16g1r1 iiaa18g1r1 iiaa19g1r1 iiaa20g1r1 iiaa21g1r1 iiaa22g1r1 and iiaa23g1r1 from 73 dairy calves the predominant subtype iiaa20g1r1 detected in this study was also found with relatively high frequency in dairy calves studied in other areas of argentina tomazic et al 2013 del coco et al 2014 apart from sweden silverls et al 2013 serbia and montenegro misic and abe 2007 the second most frequent iiaa18g1r1 subtype seems to be more widely distributed being reported in england brook et al 2009 the netherlands wielinga et al 2008 sweden silverls et al 2013 czech republic kv et al 2011 hungary plutzer and karanis 2007 serbia and montenegro misic and abe 2007 brazil do couto et al 2013 and argentina tomazic et al 2013 del coco et al 2014 in england this subtype has been also identified in humans chalmers et al 2011 strongly suggesting a zoonotic transmission risk in contrast a recent study carried out in argentinean and brazilian persons c hominis was frequently detected peralta et al 2016 and none of c parvum subtypes reported in this study were found further research is required to understand the real clinical significance of each c parvum subtype as well as their interaction when co-infections occur the presence of at least one c parvum zoonotic subtype in dairy calves implies transmission to humans consequently molecular epidemiology studies in humans especially in farm workers that are in close contact with c parvum-infected animals may further substantiate the existence of zoonotic transmission of the parasite the current study revealed that cryptosporidium parvum is widely distributed in dairy calf operations the five c parvum gp60 subtypes iiaa18g1r1 iiaa20g1r1 iiaa21g1r1 iiaa22g1r1 and a novel iiaa24g1r1 variant were identified the most commonly detected subtypes in calves with diarrhea and high infection intensity score were iiaa20g1r1 and iiaa18g1r1 subtype iiaa18g1r1 was frequently found in this study and is strongly implicated in zoonotic transmission suggesting that calves might be an important source of human cryptosporidiosis in argentina however to confirm this hypothesis studies in humans are required  cloning prokaryotic soluble expression

continue to become more popular as household companions and pets 1 a variety of viral infections pose a serious threat to felines including a high incidence of feline leukemia virus felv 2 feline coronavirus fcov 3 feline immunodeficiency virus fiv 4 and feline panleukopenia virus fpv 5 currently the only preventative vaccines and therapeutic drugs available for use in pet cats have limited effectiveness nevertheless interferons ifns play an increasingly complementary role in antiviral therapy for virus-infected cats 6 the main function of ifns in the antiviral immune response is to induce the expression of antiviral proteins that then further activate antiviral antiproliferative and immunomodulatory cellular responses 7 generally ifns are classified into three subgroups type i ifns type ii ifns and type iii ifns type i ifns including ifn- ifn- ifn- ifn- ifn- ifn- ifn- and ifn- play a direct role in antiviral immune responses 78 type ii ifn namely ifn- is produced by t lymphocytes and natural killer cells in response to the recognition of infected cells 9 type iii ifns including ifn-1 ifn-2 and ifn-3 regulate the antiviral immune response via a distinct receptor complex similar to type i ifns 1011 interferon omega ifn- which is produced primarily by leukocytes displays similar structure and physicochemical characteristics to type i ifns and researchers have focused on developing therapeutic drugs based on feline ifn- feifn- to treat viral infections in cats 612 felv is an important pathogen in both domestic and wild cats that causes degenerative and immunosuppressive disorders such as anorexia apathy cachexia and progressive weakness 1314 published research has demonstrated that feifn- has the therapeutic potential to treat felv-infected cats 1315 presumably by inhibiting the replication cycle of felv 16 several studies have revealed that recombinant feline ifn- rfeifn- had statistically significant therapeutic effects on both felv infection and felvfiv coinfection 1317 currently rfeifn- serving as an immunomodulator is the first interferon licensed for use in cats to treat felv fiv and canine parvovirus infections 6818 feline

drugs available for treatment 192021 previous studies have demonstrated that rfeifn- represents a therapeutic candidate for treating fipv-infected cats 6 in addition data from several studies suggest that rfeifn- can also exert protective effects on other viral infections including bovine enterovirus bev infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus bovine viral diarrhea virus bvdv vesicular stomatitis

spleen lymphocytes of cats stimulated by vsv infection combined with polyic treatment these genes were then expressed in their soluble forms in escherichia coli the molecular characteristics of feifn-a and feifn-b were analyzed and the species-specific and broad-spectrum antiviral activities of both were evaluated in vitro our results suggest that the feifn-a and feifn-b proteins described

the cultures were continually cultivated for another 6 h after centrifugation at 12000 g for 10 min the cell pellets were lysed and analyzed by 12 sds-page to determine the optimal induction time the recombinant strain was induced by the optimized final concentration of iptg for 4 h 6 h 8 h 10 h and 12 h following centrifugation and cells lysis the proteins were again analyzed by 12 sds-page the fusion protein expressed by the pcold-feifn-bl21 bacteria cells was subjected to cleavage by the 3c protease sigma st louis mo usa the target recombinant feifn- protein was then purified using ni2 affinity chromatography columns according to the manufacturers instructions followed by confirmation analysis using sds-page the purified feifn- protein was stored at 80 c until use vsv was used as a virus model to evaluate the antiviral activity of the recombinant feifn- via the in vitro microdose cytopathic effect inhibition assay mcia according to the method described previously 1226 with slight modifications briefly 100 l of the purified feifn- sample was serially diluted ten-fold in dmem containing 10 fbs and transferred to confluent f81 cell monolayers in 96-well cell culture plates and then incubated at 37 c in 5 co2 for 18 h f81 cells without ifn treatment were used as a control group after incubation vsv moi  1 was prepared as described above added into the 96-well plate and incubated for 8-12 h until the cpe of the cells in the viral control group reached 100 next the culture medium was removed and the cells were stained with 02 crystal violet in 20 ethanol at 37 c for 30 min the cells were then destained with 01 acetic acid in 50 ethanol at 37 c for 5 min before determining the absorbance of each well at 595 nm each sample was performed with eight biological replicates and three technical replicates the antiviral activity of the ifn was calculated as the method previously described which is expressed as units per milligram according to the ratio of ifn titer and protein concentration 27 in parallel the intercat ifn antiviral drug toray industries tokyo japan was used as an ifn treatment control in addition we determined the species-specific antiviral activity of the recombinant feifn- by conducting mcias using vsv in f81 vero mdck mdbk and pk-15 cells broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the recombinant feifn- was determined by conducting mcias using vsv fcov cpv bvdv and pedv the results are shown as mean  sem n  3 for three independent experiments statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism v50 software tukeys multiple comparison tests and one-way analysis of variance anova tests were used to analyze the significance of the differences between groups  p  005  p  001 and  p  0001 we first collected splenic lymphocytes from cats infected with vsv and treated with polyic simultaneously we then performed rt-pcr assays using a pair of degenerate primers to identify two genes encoding feifn- referred to as feifn-a and feifn-b figure 1a these two novel genes were deposited in the genbank with accession numbers mk682680 and mk682681 following nucleotide sequence homology analysis we found that the feifn-a gene mk682680 with a size of 591 bp shared a maximum nucleotide sequence homology of 9188 916 amino acid homology with the 13 known subtypes of feifn- feifn-1 to feifn-13 genes published in the genbank figure 1c the feifn-b gene mk682681 with a size of 612 bp shared a maximum sequence homology of 9020 894 amino acid homology with the 13 known subtypes of feifn- figure 1d the sequence homology shared between the feifn-a and feifn-b genes was only 8301 figure 1b indicating that the two genes identified in this study were novel feifn- genes we constructed a phylogenetic tree comparing the feifn-ab genes identified in this study with other ifn gene sequences published in genbank from different animals using the software dnastar megalign and mega7 the results showed that the feifn-ab genes belonged in the type i ifn family but that their evolutionary relationship to the known feline ifn- genes already published in the genbank figure 2 was distant indicating that the feifn-a and feifn-b genes identified for the first time here are new subtypes of feline ifn- the characteristics of the novel feline ifn- proteins feifn-a and feifn-b were analyzed using several online bioinformatics software programs including the identification of potential signal peptide cleavage sites n-glycosylation sites o-glycosylation sites phosphorylation sites subcellular localization and transmembrane regions the results from these detailed analyses are displayed in table 1 in addition we also used online software algorithms to predict antigen epitopes hydrophobicity and the secondary and three-dimensional structures of the feifn-a and feifn-b proteins as shown in figure 3 the antigen epitopes of feifn-a predicted by bepipred 10 software were located at amino acids residues 1923 2734 66 7074 96107 128138 158162 179182 and 192-186 figure 3a and the antigen epitopes of feifn-b were located at amino acid residues 1923 2733 7076 96107 128145 165169 and 200203 figure 3b the maximum hydrophobicity of feifn-a was 192 and the minimum hydrophobicity was 227 the maximum hydrophobicity of feifn-b was 227 and the minimum hydrophobicity was 236 the secondary structure of the two feifn- proteins was predicted using sopma software and revealed that feifn-a contained 6224 alpha helix 255 beta sheet and 3418 irregular curl structures figure 3c whereas feifn-b contained 6552 alpha helix 197 beta sheet and 3153 irregular curl structures figure 3d the three-dimensional structures of feifn-a and feifn-b were predicted with swiss-model software and are shown in figure 3ef respectively the genes encoding feifn-a and feifn-b were subcloned into the prokaryotic soluble expression vector pcold-tf and then transformed into e coli bl21 competent cells thus generating the recombinant protein expressing e coli strains pcold-feifn-abl21 and pcold-feifn-bbl21 after inducing their expression with iptg the rfeifn-a figure 4a and rfeifn-b figure 4b proteins fused with the trigger factor tf of approximately 57 kda and were primarily expressed in their soluble forms subsequently we optimized the expression conditions of the rfeifn- proteins from the pcold-feifn-abl21 and pcold-feifn-bbl21 e coli strains our observations indicated that the optimal induction conditions for rfeifn-a protein expression were an iptg concentration of 10 mmoll figure 4c and an induction time of 8 h figure 4d and the optimal induction conditions for rfeifn-b protein expression were an iptg concentration of 08 mmoll figure 4e and an induction time of 10 h figure 4f after that the fused proteins rfeifn-abtf were purified by his-tag ni2 affinity column chromatography and subjected to cleavage using the 3c protease the cleaved proteins were then purified by his-tag ni2 affinity column chromatography once again after which we collected the purified recombinant rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b proteins with molecular weights of approximately 21 kda and 22 kda respectively figure 4g we determined the antiviral activity of rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b using microdose cytopathic effect inhibition assays mcias and vsv as the viral model that was propagated on f81 cells as shown in figure 5 both rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b demonstrated good antiviral activity similar to the intercat ifn feline ifn antiviral drug positive control however no antiviral effect in negative control groups cells untreated with the ifns was detected we then tested whether the antiviral activities of rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b were species-specific to address this question we performed mcias with vsv propagated in several different cell lines from different animal species including f81 cells cat vero cells monkey mdck cells dog mdbk cells cattle and pk-15 cells pig as shown in figure 6 the purified recombinant feifn-a and feifn-b proteins showed antiviral activity in both homologous animal cells f81 cells and heterologous animal cells vero mdck mdbk and pk-15 cells in vitro the antiviral activity of the rfeifn- proteins in heterologous animal cells was significantly stronger than that of the intercat ifn control although the intercat ifn displayed high antiviral activity in f81 and vero cells it had significantly weak antiviral activity in mdck and mdbk cells and no antiviral activity in pk-15 cells furthermore the antiviral activity of rfeifn-b was better than that of rfeifn-a in homologous and heterologous animal cells but especially in homologous animal cells that originated from cats however no antiviral activity was detected in cells control groups cells untreated with the ifns next we wanted to investigate whether the antiviral activities of the recombinant feifn-a and feifn-b proteins were also broad-spectrum we performed mcias using a wide range of different viruses including vsv fcov cpv bvdv and pedv as shown in figure 7 rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b both displayed in vitro antiviral activity against vsv fcov cpv bvdv and pedv their antiviral activities were especially strong against fcov and vsv in contrast the antiviral activity of rfeifn-b against fcov and vsv was significantly stronger than that of rfeifn-a no notable differences were observed between rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b with cpv bvdv or pedv in addition the antiviral activity of rfeifn-b against fcov and vsv was significantly stronger than that of intercat ifn and the antiviral activities of both rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b against cpv bvdv and pedv were significantly higher than that of intercat ifn in fact we observed no antiviral activity against bvdv or pedv by intercat ifn unsurprisingly there was no antiviral activity detected in cells control groups cells untreated with the ifns currently cats are continuing to become more and more common as household pets we know of a wide variety of viral infections that can seriously endanger the health of pet cats such as felv fiv fipv fcov and feline calicivirus fcv interferon represents a promising potential therapeutic agent that can effectively treat pet cats infected with these viruses in this study we identified two new genes encoding feline ifn- feifn-a and feifn-b in the spleen lymphocytes of cats following sequence homology analysis we found that feifn-a and feifn-b shared maximum nucleotide sequence homologies of 9188 and 9020 and maximum amino acid homologies of 916 and 894 with the 13 previously published subtypes of feline ifn- respectively in addition phylogenetic tree analysis of ifns in cats and other species constructed using neighbor-joining analysis revealed that feifn-a and feifn-b do belong to the type i ifn family but their evolutionary relationship to known feline ifn- genes was distant indicating that feifn-a and feifn-b were indeed new subtypes of feline ifn- we deposited these two genes into the genbank with the accession numbers mk682680 feifn-a and mk682681 feifn-b thus enriching the ifn- data submitted to the genbank 12 in this study the characteristics of the feifn-a and feifn-b proteins such as signal peptide sequences signal peptide cleavage sites phosphorylation sites glycosylation sites antigen epitopes hydrophobicity and transmembrane regions were analyzed using bioinformatics to provide better theoretical guidance for the functional study of these proteins the mature proteins with normal biological activity were formed only after the signal peptide sequence was removed from the precursor protein thus allowing them to be secreted outside the cell membrane 2829 we used online software to predict that the signal peptide sequence of the feifn-ab proteins consists of 23 amino acid residues and that the signal peptide cleavage site is located between residues gly23 and cys24 the results indicated that the recombinant feifn-a and feifn-b proteins could be expressed in vitro in their soluble forms glycosylation is an important post-translational modification process that can affect the antigenic determinants charge properties enzymatic properties and thermal stability of proteins similar to previous reports for the 13 known feifn- subtypes 12 we observed no n-glycosylation sites present in feifn-a or feifn-b however our analyses predicted nine potential o-glycosylation sites in feifn-a and six potential o-glycosylation sites in feifn-b which is different from previous reports on the other known ifn- subtypes 6 studies have shown that glycosylation sites can play an important role in determining the activity of ifns 3031 for example glycosylated ifn- has been observed to be markedly more potent than non-glycosylated ifn- against hepatitis c virus bvdv yellow fever virus and west nile virus with even more superior effects than ifn- ifn- and ifn- 630 insectbaculovirus expression systems are one of the most effective eukaryotic expression systems for preparing feline ifns these expression systems are capable of making post-translational modifications such as glycosylation which allows proteins to fold correctly thus producing highly active and stable ifns 3233343536 however the application of these systems is limited by drawbacks such as low yield of ifn protein and complicated operation requirements 37 therefore e coli expression systems are still the most widely used prokaryotic expression system for protein production with their characteristics of simple procedures large-scale production and low cost 383940 generally recombinant ifn is produced by e coli expression systems in an insoluble inclusion body form that has not been modified or folded correctly resulting in the loss of its biological activity 4142 to obtain a soluble and biologically active ifn protein the inclusion bodies need to be denatured and then renatured which is a time-consuming laborious process 40 in this study we selected the prokaryotic soluble expression system pcold-tf to prepare recombinant feifn-a and feifn-b the pcold-tf system is a highly efficient soluble expression system with a his-tagged tf that allows the expressed protein to be effectively modified folded and secreted into the cytoplasm 4344 following the construction of recombinant e coli strains and induction by iptg the rfeifn-ab proteins were expressed in their soluble forms and analyzed via sds-page we optimized expression conditions for the rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b proteins and purified them using his-tag ni2 affinity column chromatography both proteins showed antiviral activity against vsv in microdose cytopathic effect inhibition assays using f81 cells our results provide a basis for further studies into the development of rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b as therapeutic agents for viral infections meanwhile our data provide evidence that the pcold-tf expression system can be used to produce ifn with full bioactivity recombinant feline interferon- rfeifn- was the first licensed immunomodulator for use in treating viral infections in cats especially fiv and felv infections 171845 furthermore rfeifn- also exhibits therapeutic effects against other feline viral infections such as fcv feline parvovirus and feline herpesvirus-1 45 as well as viruses that originate in other animals such as foot-and-mouth disease virus influenza virus bvdv vsv prv and rotavirus 61218 in this study our results demonstrated that both rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b had antiviral activity in homologous animal cells f81 cells cat and heterologous animal cells vero cells monkey mdbk cells cattle mdck cells dog pk-15 cells pig indicating that rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b have broad cross-species antiviral activity in vitro similar to previously published findings in mdbk and mdck cells 12 in contrast the antiviral activities of rfeifn-b in homologous and heterologous animal cells were better than that of rfeifn-a intriguingly the rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b proteins exhibited antiviral activity in mdck cells despite the absence of ifn- in canines 4647 we speculate that different ifns with different physiological functions are likely responsible for the difference of results obtained in our study compared to other published studies furthermore analysis of the broad-spectrum antiviral activities of rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b revealed that they were effective against vsv fcov pedv bvdv and cpv out of those five viruses antiviral activity was strongest against vsv and fcov no significant differences in antiviral activity against cpv bvdv or pedv were observed between rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b however the overall broad-spectrum antiviral activity of rfeifn-b was significantly stronger than that of rfeifn-a recently combination antiviral therapy has become a common practice in treating feline viral infections due to pharmacokinetics and the short half-life of ifn alone 4849 there are many published studies focused on the combination of ifn- with other therapeutic agents such as chemotherapeutic agents 50 ifn- 51 and ribavirin 6 suggesting this is an attractive strategy to use against viral infections we further evaluated the antiviral effects of rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b combined with feline il-18 against vsv and fcov in f81 cells our results revealed that the in vitro antiviral activity of combination therapy was significantly increased compared to that of rfeifn-a or rfeifn-b alone indicating that rfeifn- combination therapy may represent a more potent option than monotherapy for treating viral infections in cats however this hypothesis requires further exploration in vivo in summary the rfeifn-a and rfeifn-b obtained in this study exhibit significant broad-spectrum antiviral activity in both homologous and heterologous cells in vitro particularly rfeifn-b suggesting a promising candidate for the development of an effective therapeutic agent against viral infections in cats and other animals in this study two new subtypes of feline ifn- a and b were identified and characterized they shared a maximum nucleotide sequence homology of 9188 and 9020 and a maximum amino acid homology of 916 and 894 with the 13 previously known subtypes of feifn- respectively we analyzed the characteristics of feifn-a and feifn-b in detail using bioinformatics followed by soluble expression and optimization of induction conditions in e coli our data showed that purified recombinant feifn-a and feifn-b had broad-spectrum antiviral activity in homologous and heterologous animal cells suggesting they are candidates for the development of effective therapeutic agents to be used against viral infections in pet cats and our research is underway to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the two novel feifns as therapeutics agent for cat viral infections in vivo in addition the reported feifn- sequences will enrich the ifn data submitted to genbank  crossspecies transfer of viruses implications for the use of viral vectors in biomedical research gene therapy and as livevirus vaccines derrick louz hans bergmans e birgit loos p rob hoeben c   the last two decades have shown an increased awareness of the fact that viruses occasionally cross the species barrier leading to the emergence of viral diseases in new host species 1 2 in the past such events may have been overlooked as the underlying cause of the emergence of a new disease however advances in diagnostic technologies now facilitate detection and recognition of new emerging viruses even at an early stage prominent examples are hantavirus haemorrhagic fever viruses arboviruses nipah and hendra viruses avian influenza virus ai monkeypox virus and the sarsassociated coronavirus sarscov 2 3 4 5 crossing the species barrier from one animal species to another is most readily noticed when it is associated with overt pathology the crosstransfer is known as a zoonosis in the case where the virus is transmitted from nonhuman hosts to humans and causes disease 6 crossing the species barrier is an unpredictable event that involves complex interactions between the virus and the newly adopted host 7 the hiv virus and contemporary human influenza viruses are prominent examples of viruses that have crossed the species barrier and established themselves permanently in the human population without further dependence on the presence of the original animal host reservoir fortunately natural adaptation of a new virus leading to permanent establishment and dissemination within the human population is a rare event 8 often the virus is not readily adapted to infect and spread efficiently from human to human the emergence of new viral infections often follows environmental ecological and technological changes caused by human activities 9 these activities may lead to an increased contact between humans and animal hosts acting as reservoirs of zoonotic viruses agricultural development an increased exploitation of environmental resources growth and increase in the mobility of the human population and trade and transportation of food and livestock have been identified as important factors contributing to the introduction and spread of a number of new viruses in the human population 10 11 12 13 the road map for crossspecies transfer may differ for individual viruses however some common underlying factors that affect the probability of zoonotic events can be identified table 1 the potential of viruses to adapt to new or changing cellular environments or ecological niches via genetic variation appears to be a key feature 8 14 the advent of novel technologies for genetic modification of viruses offers new opportunities for biomedical research often these activities involve handling of viruses and their genetically modified variants in large quantities the use of viral vectors in experimental gene therapy or as live vaccines may be also a cause for concern indeed such activities meet the primary requirements for crossspecies transfer ie contact between infectious viruses and a potential new host species therefore it is important to identify those activities that have a finite risk of leading to new viral infections and to practice appropriate biosafety measurements in this review risk factors associated with activities with viral vectors will be addressed from the perspective of emerging viruses that have crossed the host barrier in nature the processes that underlie crossspecies transfer through hostrange expansion and establishment of viruses in new host species depend on the accumulation of genetic changes 7 15 these are likely to differ for various viruses and may affect virtually every aspect of the viral life cycle this process of adaptation can occur by a variety of mechanisms including mutation recombination and reassortment mutations occur in the genomes of dna as well as rna viruses in general mutations occur slower in dna viruses than in rna viruses because of the proofreading function of many dna polymerases this corrects mistakes made by the polymerase during replication rna genomes are replicated by rna polymerases that lack proofreading therefore mutations in rna viruses can occur up to a millionfold more frequently than in dna viruses 16 17 as a consequence rna viruses generally evolve more rapidly and lead to genetic heterogeneity and the presence of socalled viral quasispecies 18 the concept of quasispecies states that in an infected host the virus exists as a population of genetically related but divergent variants defined by a master sequence and a complex and dynamic series of mutant sequences while the master sequence remains the predominant sequence present within the population the spectrum of mutants may shift in response to selective pressures from the quasispecies population a variant may be selectively expanded 19 20 21 although the major mechanism that drives adaptation is based on accumulation of point mutations evolution of viruses also occurs through recombination recombination occurs in both dna and rna viruses leading to the exchange of parts of genomes this may result in the emergence of new virus variants for recombination to take place at least coinfection of a cell by two different virus variants is required recombination plays an important role in evolutionary changes of dna viruses in some cases recombination between viruses and cellular nucleic acid can lead to the capture of cellular coding sequences 22 reassortment is another important evolutionary mechanism in rna viruses with a segmented genome such as influenza viruses and reoviruses after coinfection of a cell with different strains or subtypes genomic segments may be shuffled and rearranged in progeny virus particles resulting in the generation of new viruses with different biological properties this offers viruses a large adaptive potential by facilitating evolutionary leaps in response to changing cellular environments without the need for gradual accumulation of favourable mutations 23 in the late 1970s a new syndrome of viral enteritis and myocarditis emerged in dogs and subsequently swept rapidly across the world killing thousands of dogs within a few years after its initial appearance the virus was named canine parvovirus type 2 cpv2 phylogenetic analysis revealed that this virus was remarkably similar to feline parvoviruslike viruses such as feline panleukemia virus fpv which infects cats mink and raccoons but not dogs 24 therefore cpv2 presumably emerged as a natural hostrange mutant of a feline parvovirus 25 26 hostrange properties are determined by the capsid protein for both cpv2 and fpv although cpv2 is capable of infecting feline cells in culture the virus does not replicate in cats fpv on the other hand is able to replicate in dogs in a restricted fashion ie in bone marrow and thymus but not in cultured dog cells 27 cpv2 differs from fpv by only two nucleotide substitutions within the capsid gene resulting in two amino acid substitutions 28 these changes are associated with the ability of cpv2 to bind to the canine transferrin receptor with high affinity 29 as a result cpv2 acquired the capacity to infect canine intestinal tissue it is thought that subsequently this virus acquired transmissibility between dogs and further adapted to replicate more efficiently in dogs as it became pandemic interestingly within three years after its initial appearance in 1978 cpv2 was replaced worldwide by an antigenically and genetically variant virus cpv2a 25 this indicates that cpv2a had a strong selective advantage over cpv2 another antigenic variant derived from cpv2a cpv2b which differs by only two amino acids arose in 1984 this implies that variants of cpv gradually arose due to further adaptation and selection in dogs in reaction to selective most likely immunological pressure the two new variants types 2a and 2b differ at 5 or 6 amino acid from cpv2 isolates 30 at present the two variants are still endemic in the canine population these two variant viruses have an expanded host range compared to the original cpv2 since they replicate in cats in both experimental settings and in the wild although with no or relatively low pathogenicity 31 32 remarkably the prevalence of cpv2a and cpv2b and new antigenic variants cpv2c has now been demonstrated in a wide range of feline populations worldwide reviewed in 33 the emergence of cpv2 serves as an example of rapid global distribution and establishment of hostrange mutants in an immunologically nave new host whereas cpv2 most likely arose as a natural hostrange mutant derived from cats some other scenarios on its emergence have been suggested 34 it was suggested that cpv2 may have emerged after crosstransfer from a yet unidentified animal host to dogs or cpv2 may have arisen under selective growth conditions during fpv livevirus vaccine production in canine cells and subsequently spread via vaccination the high titers of the virus shed in faeces and its resistance to inactivation may explain its initial rapid dissemination also into countries with strict quarantine regulations for dogs human activity may have stimulated the spread through mechanical transport presumably aided by longdistance air travel 25 35 the aids pandemic is now generally accepted to stem from a viral zoonosis human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2 hiv1 and hiv2 emerged separately around the same time in distinct geographically areas as the result of multiple zoonotic transmissions from simian immunodeficiency virus sivinfected nonhuman primates to humans 36 based on their genomic organization and phylogenetic analyses it is clear that hiv1 and hiv2 fall into two different siv lineages 37 this implicates that both viruses must have had distinct origins both phylogenetic and epidemiologic evidence indicate that hiv1 evolved as a consequence of sivcpz transmission from chimpanzees to humans in central africa 38 39 however to date no serological or genetic evidence of widespread prevalence of hiv1related strains exists in chimpanzees in the wild in africa transmission of siv from sooty mangabeys in west africa most probably caused the emergence of hiv2 since siv strains derived from sooty mangabeys are phylogenetically closely related to hiv2 hiv2 is found at a high prevalence in sooty mangabeys 40 41 both hiv1 and hiv2 show enormous genetic diversity hiv1 comprises three genetically distinct virus groups m n and o of which the predominant group m consists of 11 subtypes or clades of which all but two have spread throughout the world in contrast hiv2 is mainly confined to the african continent and comprises seven distinct phylogenetic lineages subtype groups a through g which can be categorized in epidemic subtypes a and b and nonepidemic subtypes c through g 37 42 it has been estimated from phylogenetic and epidemiological data that initial crossspecies transfers of both the m group of strains of hiv1 and the progenitor group of subtypes of hiv2 may have taken place around 1930 in west africa 43 44 hiv1 may have initially started to spread in africa at the beginning of the 1960s 45 46 therefore more than two decades of silent humantohuman transmission may have occurred in africa before aids became apparent and hiv was identified as its causative agent in the early 1980s in the advent of the hiv epidemic early siv strains initially may have crossed the species barrier as a result of an increase of contact between humans and sivinfected simian species apparently activities such as hunting handling and consumption of contaminated uncooked simian meat led to direct exposure to animal blood and body fluids 47 the following years passaging between infected humans of partially adapted siv strains may have resulted in series of cumulative mutations and genetic changes the large genetic differences that exist between siv and hiv indicate that the initial siv strains that crossed the species barrier must have undergone adaptation in humans in a relatively short period of time this suggests the involvement of some modern iatrogenic event massive vaccination programs carried out at that time using nonsterile injection needles may have provided opportunities for transmission and further adaptation of the virus to humans in africa 48 49 the genetic and phenotypic evolution of the hiv virus still proceeds at a high pace not only between individuals worldwide but also within infected individuals during the timecourse of infection the extensive genetic diversity originates from the rapid viral turnover and replication errors caused by reverse transcriptase 50 51 in addition among the globally pandemic hiv1 m group several circulating recombinant forms crfs exist these crfs result from recombination events between two different strains within the same individual and now constitute 1020 of newly characterized circulating strains 52 this diversity allows the hiv virus to rapidly adapt under selective pressure generated by antiretroviral drugs and host immune responses selection of hiv variants has been implicated in the use of different coreceptor molecules and selection for different cell types and tissues and body compartments such as lymph nodes and the brain during late stages of infection and manifestation of different disease patterns 53 54 the emergence of hiv exemplifies how multiple independent crossspecies transmissions of simian viruses that are not associated with disease in their natural hosts eventually resulted in the establishment of two types of hiv in the human population while adapting to its new host the virus underwent a myriad of molecular changes changes in social behaviour of humans may well have offered opportunities for newly evolved hiv strains to become pandemic pandemic influenza a is a zoonotic disease caused by crossspecies transfer of influenza a viruses from animal reservoirs the twentieth century has witnessed three influenza pandemics spanish influenza 1918 asian influenza 1957 and hong kong influenza 1968 that killed millions of people worldwide although influenza a viruses have been isolated from a variety of vertebrates including pigs horses seals and whales birds serve as the main reservoir and are a potential source for new pandemic strains 55 influenza a viruses contain eight negativesense rna segments that code for at least ten polypeptides of which eight are structural viral proteins and two nonstructural proteins influenza a viruses are divided into subtypes based on both serological and genetic differences between the surface proteins and their encoding genes respectively to date 15 hemagglutinin ha subtypes h1h15 and nine subtypes n1n9 of the neuraminidase na proteins have been identified influenza a viruses containing all different combinations of the ha and na subtypes have been identified in aquatic birds in humans only influenza a viruses of hemagglutinin subtypes h1 through 3 and neuramidase subtypes n1 and n2 have established permanent lineages these viruses are considered human influenza a viruses 56 in nature new influenza a viruses emerge via two mechanisms of antigenic variation the first antigenic drift is caused by accumulation of point mutations in both the na and ha surface proteins enabling new antigenic variant viruses to evade the human immune system and emerge via selection influenza a viruses that emerge via antigenic drift are responsible for the yearly epidemics in the human population antigenic shift occurs when a variant influenza a virus arises that is antigenitically completely distinct from former circulating influenza a viruses the new virus is a reassortant that is characterized by the presence of a novel hemagglutinin gene segment alone or in combination with a complete novel neuraminidase gene segment influenza a variants that emerge through antigenic shift are potentially capable of causing novel pandemics in an immunologically nave human population 55 the avirulent nature of avian influenza virus infections in ducks and waterfowl results from adequate adaptation to their hosts 55 avian influenza viruses do not replicate efficiently in humans similarly human influenza a viruses do not replicate efficiently in birds 57 58 the trachea tissue of the pig contains receptors for both avian and human influenza a viruses therefore they are permissive to both human and avian viruses and thought to function as a mixing vessel for reassortment of not only human and avian but also swine influenza a viruses 59 pigs are therefore also considered to be ecological niches important for the emergence of new influenza a viruses in humans in pigs newly reassorted viruses may further evolve by accumulation of additional mutations further adapt to a mammalian host and eventually be transmitted to humans ample data indicate that further adaptation to the human cellular environment is necessary for replication and efficient transmission in humans adaptation has a polygenic basis and may involve multiple viral gene segments it should be noted however that only in rare cases will crossspecies transmission lead to permanent establishment of new lineages of influenza a viruses in humans 56 60 analyses of the viruses that caused the asian and hong kong pandemics revealed that these were caused by reassortants that contained a mixture of avian and human genome segments 61 62 genetic analysis of the 1918 spanish influenza virus initially suggested that the epidemic originated from a whole avian influenza virus that had been transmitted from infected pigs to humans 63 however the origin of the 1918 pandemic strain still remains an enigma since the presence of its ha molecule did not originate from any known avian strain in addition there was no evidence of adaptation to a mammalian host 64 it was not until the 1997 hong kong epidemic that direct transmission of whole avian viruses to humans was observed analysis of the virus that caused this epidemic revealed that a reassorted influenza a virus h5n1 of entirely avian origin had crossed the species barrier apparently without adaptation to a mammalian host interestingly the virus was able to replicate in humans but had not acquired humantohuman transmissibility preventing efficient spread and potentially a global epidemic reviewed in 65 receptor specificity is considered to be a major determinant of the host range of influenza a viruses the ha protein plays a pivotal role in hostcell receptor recognition and attachment it binds sialic acid sa on the host cells avian influenza a viruses preferentially bind to terminal sa which is joined by an alpha23linkage to the sugar chain of the glycoprotein or glycolipid in the gut however human influenza a strains bind to terminal sa through an alpha26bond to cells in the respiratory tract as a result of acquired mutations 66 67 68 the 1997 hong kong avian h5n1 strain however possessed avian binding properties 69 this indicates that receptor specificity alone is not an absolute requirement for birdtohuman transmission the host range of influenza a viruses is determined by a complex interplay of multiple factors 70 the influenza a virus illustrates the unpredictability of virus variation as well as the viruss great potential for adaptation regular close contact between birds pigs and humans offers opportunities for reassortment and crossspecies transfer hence the livebird markets in southeast asia are considered a risk 71 a variety of experimental conditions are applied in the laboratory for propagation and isolation of viruses and their genetically modified derivatives as a result these viruses are subject to selective forces that are likely to differ from those experienced in nature although conditions may be well defined and controlled various selective pressures are generated in culture due to eg changes of concentrations of nucleotide substrates the addition of mutagenic substances the use of different incubation temperatures incubation with antibodies or a change of host cells these different selective forces have unpredictable influences on the virus since cell culture conditions can have profound effects on the composition of viral populations viral stocks consist of genetically heterogeneous populations reviewed in 20 72 therefore adaptation of a virus to cell culture inevitably results in selection of new virus variants thus under experimental conditions cell cultures represent ecological minienvironments in which viruses are subjected to selective forces and can readily evolve yielding new variants with an altered cell tropism or host range the mouse hepatitis virus mhv is characterized by a narrow hostrange and tissue specificity both in vivo and in vitro this specificity is primarily determined by the viruss surface spike s glycoprotein which is responsible for attachment to specific hostcell receptors 73 mhv virus variants with both an altered receptor specificity and a broadened host range were selected during continued passaging in murine or mixed cultures consisting of murine and nonpermissive hamster cells here mhv acquired the ability to infect human hamster and monkey cells mhv hostrange expansion has been attributed to the presence of virus variants recognizing homologues of the normal receptor adaptation required mutations in the surface s protein and selection of hostrange mutants for the use of the alternative cellular receptor 74 75 76 77 selection of variants with a changed receptor specificity resulting from passage in cell culture has also been demonstrated for footandmouth disease virus fmdv hostcell specificity of the parental virus is based on an rgd motifdependent integrinmediated entry pathway 78 the rgd motif is an arginineglycineaspartic protein sequence within the virus capsid that recognizes and binds to some integrins on the cell surface of the host cell 79 yet upon multiple passages in bhk21 cells fmdv variants emerged that acquired the ability to infect several initially nonpermissive human and animal cell lines via an alternative entry pathway analysis of these variants revealed that adaptation of fmdv in cell culture led to an enhanced affinity for heparan sulfate as a receptor independent of the rgd motif interestingly these hostrange variants were able to maintain infectivity in cell culture not only independent of an rgd motif but also without the requirement to bind to heparin sulfate 80 81 this implies the use of alternative receptors selection of the fmdv hostrange mutants was associated with amino acid substitutions in or near the capsid rgd motif 82 83 84 recently it was demonstrated that passaging of fmdv in bhk21 cells led to an expansion of the hostcell tropism to nonhuman primate and human cell lines selection of these hostrange variants was also associated with amino acid substitutions in the viral capsid proteins 85 there is less data on mutation frequencies and adaptation of dna viruses in cell cultures compared to rna viruses however there are a number of illustrative examples adaptation of sv40 and polyomavirus to different cellular environments resulted in the emergence of hostrange mutants in cell cultures reviewed in 86 random mutagenesis of human adenovirus followed by repeated passaging in certain cell lines allowed isolation of adenovirus hostrange mutants 87 88 human adenovirus 2 hadv2 mutants with altered specificity resulting from reduced binding affinity of the adenovirus pentonbase protein for the integrins on the cells were selected in persistently infected cell lines 89 more recently upon passaging in cell culture adaptation led to the emergence of herpesvirus hostrange mutants these viruses use alternative receptors and replicate in different cell types in the natural host and in cells from different species that were previously nonpermissive several glycoproteins are essential for the entry of alphaherpesviruses such as pseudorabies virus prv herpes simplex virus hsv and bovine herpesvirus 1 bhv1 reviewed in 90 interaction between eg the viral glycoprotein c gc and heparan sulfate mediates primary attachment for infection however a secondary interaction between glycoprotein d gd and one of several entry receptors is required single amino acid substitutions in the gd glycoprotein of herpes simplex 1 hsv1 as well as complete ablation of this glycoprotein in the swine pseudorabies virus prv led to a gd glycoproteinindependent entry mode using alternate receptors 91 92 93 at least three classes of cellsurface proteins are now thought to be involved in alphaherpesvirus entry 94 also cell culture adaptation of human cytomegalovirus hcmv a betaherpesvirus resulted in the selection of phenotypic variants that had lost their endothelial tropism 95 in cell culture viruses may readily adapt by mutation selection and competition these processes are stochastic in nature adaptation is therefore an unpredictable process strongly influenced by the experimental setting eg the multiplicity of infection used the number of passages employed and the type of selection employed one should be aware of the potential adaptation when working with virusinfected cell cultures the advent of reverse genetics systems now allows the generation of recombinant infectious influenza a viruses entirely from cloned cdnas in cell culture these systems are based on transfection of at least eight plasmids each containing a copy of one of the eight influenza a virus genomic segments 96 97 the technology permits the generation of custommade recombinant influenza a viruses reassortants containing specific heterologous gene segments of interest and offers the possibility to study their biological properties in cellular and animal model systems in addition reverse genetics can be used in the development of vaccine strategies the use of reverse genetics allows the deliberate introduction of specific mutations in viral genes allowing selective evaluation of the contribution of individual genes or segments to eg the viruss virulencepathogenicity transmissibility and host range this approach has already been shown to be pivotal for the generation and characterization of reassortants containing heterologous influenza a segments from eg highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai h5n1 strains 98 or the 1918 pandemic strain 99 100 in addition this technology allowed the generation from cloned segments of the hpai h5n1 strain that caused the deadly 1997 hong kong outbreak 101 reverse genetics systems can also be used as an alternative for the production of both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines in preparing for pandemic influenza a virus threats conventional annual inactivated vaccine production is based on simultaneous infection of chicken eggs with two different influenza a strains followed by selection of the desired vaccine virus this reassorted virus then contains the na and ha segments of the relevant circulating influenza a virus against the background of six complementary segments derived from an attenuated reference strain eg apuerto rico834 h1n1 which is safe for humans 102 to overcome the difficulties of selecting such reassortants and subsequent laborious timeconsuming passaging of these viruses plasmidbased reverse genetics can be used for fast and directed generation of vaccine strains 103 for vaccines based on hpai viruses the use of reverse genetics has another important advantage such highly pathogenic viruses are lethal to chicken embryos and cannot be grown in large quantities in this way the viruss high pathogenicity is associated with the presence of basic amino acids adjacent to the cleavage site within the ha molecule 104 by using recombinant dna technology this sequence can be eliminated plasmidbased reverse genetics can then be used to generate the desired vaccine strain containing the attenuated ha molecule 105 106 in conclusion plasmidbased reverse genetics enables the generation of defined reassorted influenza a viruses consisting of eg human and avian viral gene segments of interest however it is usually not possible to predict the biological properties from the gene constellation of such variant viruses such activities therefore pose potential risks in particular when the gene constellation is not based on characterized isolates recombinant dna technology has allowed the construction of infectious cdna clones of large rna viruses such as coronaviruses including the sarsassociated coronavirus sarscov 107 108 109 these reverse genetics systems can now be used as tools for the production of defined genetically modified coronaviruses 110 this allows the introduction of specific mutations into the genome of coronaviruses and eg the exchange of specific viral genes between different coronaviruses to study their pathogenesis replication strategy and crossspecies transmissibility the possibility to engineer tissue and host tropism using these technologies makes coronaviruses potential vectors for vaccine development and possibly for gene therapy 111 112 113 hostrange specificity of coronaviruses is primarily determined at the virus entry level several studies have demonstrated that sequence changes in the gene encoding the coronavirus surface spike s glycoprotein can lead to a change of tropism and hostrange specificity 73 this is illustrated by the generation of a chimeric coronavirus by targeted recombination in which the ectodomain of the s glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus mhv was replaced by the ectodomain of the s glycoprotein of feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv this substitution conferred specific tropism for feline cells while the ability to infect murine cells was lost 114 vice versa a reverse genetics strategy for fipv was developed conferring the ability to infect murine cells 115 similar techniques may aid the studies on the pathogenicity of the sarscov the examples mentioned above indicate that the use of recombinant dna technology now provides for powerful systems to generate and modify eg highly pathogenic viruses such as pandemic influenza a viruses and sarscov live attenuated virus vaccines are among the most successful viral vaccines known to date traditionally attenuation is achieved by the jennerian approach ie serial passaging in cell culture 116 by this method a number of useful vaccines currently in use have been generated still the mechanism by which the attenuated phenotype evolves is largely unknown for instance the nature and degree of genetic variation present at different stages of the attenuation process is usually not known the presumed mechanism of attenuation is based on hostrange restriction due to accumulation of changes in surface glycoproteins 117 thus selection of variants seems inherent to the process of generating the desired level of attenuation and genetic stability to prevent reversion to the wildtype virus therefore dependent on the passage history diversity within the virus population is likely to represent adaptations to growth in cell culture as a result genetic variants with different hostrange phenotypes may be present in the vaccine strain of the virus examination of substrains of live attenuated vaccine lots based on the yellow virus 17d strain and measles virus edmonston strain demonstrate that these virus stocks indeed consist of a heterogeneous population of variants 118 119 120 121 a number of adverse consequences of the use of such virus stocks have been reported and associated with possible selective growth advantage of hostrange variants in the recipient 122 123 therefore caution should be taken before releasing live attenuated viral vaccines based on nonhuman animal viruses significant progress has been made in approaches to genetically modify the tropism of vector viruses such strategies have been used in the development of cancer gene therapy initially replicationdeficient vectors were used for this purpose however to improve efficacy tumortargeted replicationcompetent viruses have been developed for the use of viral therapy of cancer virotherapy 124 125 here we discuss some of the developments with human adenovirus type 5 hadv5 hadv5 has been widely used for a number of vector applications 126 however the use of genetically modified adenoviral vectors has some limitations 127 their efficacy relies on the presence of its receptor car coxackievirus and adenovirus receptor for hadv5 on target cells primary binding of the virus to car is mediated by the knob domain of the adenoviral fiber protein subsequent internalization is mediated by the interaction between the rgd motif in the penton base of the virus and secondary hostcell integrin receptor molecules 128 129 to achieve celltype specificity and a high efficacy in the absence of the car receptor different strategies have been developed these include redirecting adenoviral binding to alternative cellular receptors by genetic modification of genes coding for the capsid proteins fiber hexon and penton base 130 this may result in either an expanded tropism or in abolishment of the adenoviral native tropism table 2 summarizes a number of properties contributing to the relative risk for the use of vector viruses for this purpose a numerical hazard score was assigned to each property table 3 summarizes a number of adenoviral vectors with altered properties and their relative risks such modified viruses are now being evaluated in a clinical setting for experimental gene therapy table 3 illustrates that a change of cell tropism tissue tropism or host range of a viral vector should be considered as factors in risk assessment for activities with genetically altered vector viruses in general the use of replicationcompetent viral vectors poses special concerns with regard to unintended spread to new and undesired cell types as well as horizontal transmission of the vector 131 132 a replicationcompetent vector virus with an altered tropism or host range virtually constitutes a new viral pathogen with the potential of a new disease manifestation in nature many factors may contribute to the emergence of a new zoonotic viral disease these factors consist of viral evolutionary processes such as mutation natural selection and competition host determinants eg immune status and physiological factors and environmental determinants such as ecological and climatological circumstances as highlighted by the emergence of new viral diseases in the last two decades the process of adaptation often involves the acquisition of an altered cell tropism or host range against this background the intensified use of viruses and their genetically modified variants as viral gene transfer vectors for biomedical research experimental gene therapy and for livevector vaccines is a cause for concern this review highlights the importance of identifying and evaluating the risks and consequences of activities that may generate hostrange mutants with the capacity of crossspecies transmission the use of such viruses may lead to inadvertent introduction of vector viruses with a changed cell or tissue tropism andor host range through an immunologically nave and nonadapted hosts interactions between the virus and the cellular receptor often determine the host range of the virus and therefore constitute a species barrier 133 minor mutations in the viral capsid or surface glycoproteins may already result in profound changes in cell tropism or host range of a virus in this review we have therefore focused on the level of virus entry to address some implications for activities with viral vectors and in particular with hostrange mutants this could contribute to a rational and reasoned inventory of factors that should be considered in risk assessments of activities with viral vectors in considering possible risks involved in handling replicationcompetent vector viruses in the laboratory awareness for phenotypic selection of viruses in cell culture should be raised possible risks involved must be mitigated by adequate biosafety measures many viruses have the capability to use various receptors 134 this implies that concepts such as hostrange barrier and hostcell specificity may be rather flexible than rigid if the host range and completion of the viral life cycle is exclusively restricted to the level of entry forced entry may bypass important discriminatory hostcell restriction steps this may result in distinct pathological phenotypes and new disease manifestations therefore precaution should be taken to avoid inadvertent release and spread of such potential harmful vector viruses it goes without saying that livevirus vaccines are among the most effective modalities to control viral pathogens it is evident that for such vaccines the benefit is higher than the possible adverse effects nevertheless the risks associated with handling vaccine viruses viral vectors and exotic viruses are small but finite we are just beginning to understand the mechanisms that drive the emergence of new viruses and viral diseases in nature there are parallels between the patterns that are seen in emerging viral diseases and certain virus modifications that are generated either deliberately or inadvertently when handling viruses in the laboratory such patterns and the associated risks should be noted the capacity of a virus to replicate and spread implies that in the risk evaluation not only the risks to the laboratory personnel or the patient but also the effects on the environment including the human population should be weighed against the evident benefits only then can viruses maintain and extend their prominent role as widely applicable entities for clinical and veterinarian use  genotyping arrays kilian dill robin liu hui piotr grodzinski michael lodes j dominic suciu david danley andrew mcshea   the need for laboratory assays that rapidly identify infectious diseases is substantiated by a number of government initiatives for their development the epidemic outbreak surveillance eos program was initiated by the us air force as an advanced concept technology demonstration actd to create a diagnostic assay that would identify 10 to 20 viruses and bacteria that are associated with upper respiratory infections uri the centers for disease control has also established its laboratory influenza test program to develop an improved diagnostic assays that detects seasonal flu and novel influenza a viruses as with the eos program the cdc recognizes the importance of being able to distinguish between flu and other uri infections a device capable of identifying this combination of bacteria and viruses must be able to overcome complexities associated with potentially highly variable genomes which is especially relevant to influenza a subtyping to date there are 16 identified hemagglutinin 1 and 9 neuraminidase subtypes for influenza a this rna virus has a negative strand segmented genome and can infect a broad range of animals including humans identification of a virus subtype is typically by serological or molecular identification of the subtype of viral hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na genes viruses with any combination of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes can infect aquatic birds whereas fewer subtypes have been found to infect humans however interspecies transmission can occur after recombination or mixing of subtypes in birds or pigs 2 16 65 in addition new human strains of virus can arise by reassortment to accomplish antigenic shift when two or more subtypes infect the same host 3 4 identification of influenza subtypes is routinely accomplished with viral detection cell culture and serological techniques such as complement fixation hemag-glutination hemagglutination inhibition assays and immunofluorescence methods 518 traditional methods are generally effective but involve labor-intensive protocols and highly trained personnel because of their speed specificity and sensitivity genomic assays are ideal for complementing serological assays for identifying the genotype of an unknown specimen especially in cases where antigenic tests are not specific enough to differentiate closely related groups 914 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr is widely used for virus identification 1517 however a positive amplification can be verified only by subsequent assays to elaborate sequence information by overcoming this limitation microarrays and biosensors have become valuable tools for viral discovery detection genotyping and sequencing 6 9 10 13 1726 although traditional assays for pathogen detection and typing represent the gold standard they alone cannot meet the future needs of rapid sensitive specific and simple methods for example although immunological methods are excellent for determining influenza subtypes they do not give detailed genetic information or information when antigenic shifts occur rt-pcr techniques depend on specific primers which may fail when corresponding viral sequences mutate microarrays offer an excellent solution as a downstream assay to pcr amplification semiconductor-based oligonucleotide array technology can be used with fluorescent labels and traditional optical scanning devices or used as a biodetector using electrochemical techniques for analysis 27 this platform is extremely flexible allowing array designs to be rapidly and easily modified and synthesized and thus permitting oligonucleotides of interest to be tested empirically in addition the ability to use electrochemical detection with semiconductor microchips eliminates the need for expensive optical scanning equipment 2729 the use of an endpoint measurement on the pcr reaction such as with a real-time pcr system when preparing the target sample that will be hybridized to the array can be used as a decision point to gate the choice of samples to be run ie assays are only run if the pcr reaction is positive two genotyping arrays have been developed an influenza a subtyping array that contains specific probes for each of 16 hemagglutinin ha subtypes and 9 neuraminidase na subtypes and also an upper respiratory pathogen diagnostic array that can be used to detect both bacteria and viruses that produce upper respiratory clinical symptoms these arrays can be hybridized with target generated from all 16 ha and 9 na subtypes or from upper respiratory tract pathogens by a one-tube rt-pcr amplification of virus rna or bacterial dna the arrays were developed with nonoverlapping probes with similar annealing stabilities that were generated from sequence databases for the influenza subtyping chip subtype-specific probes were selected from a pool of over 23000 ha and 15000 na sequences and then compared to the database to ensure that each probe was unique to the respective subtype and would hybridize to the maximum number of variant sequences subtype-specific probes were also subgrouped to give a finer detail for follow-up analysis such as cluster analysis and sequence reconstruction the probes for the upper respiratory arrays were developed in a similar manner and then cross-checked against databases to minimize the possibility of cross-hybridization of target and background from host genomic dna the arrays were validated by hybridizing target see fig 61 that was generated from rna or dna from all ha and na subtypes on the influenza chip and all viruses and bacteria on the upper respiratory chip which includes influenza a and b parainfluenza adenovirus 4 respiratory syncitial virus coronavirus streptococcus pyogenes bordetella pertussis chlamydia pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumonia see fig 62ab the target sample preparation system used with these arrays is similar to standard rt-pcr-based methods except that it uses a very redundant consensus priming system that maximizes the chance that novel strains of influenza will amplify and thus minimize false negative results



 primers and probes for bacteria were developed from conserved genes and then compared to genomes of related organisms the arrays contain multiple probes that correspond to key distinguishing elements of each organism or subtype the combination of assay speed approximately 1 hour hybridization array sectoring which would allow multiple assays on one array the potential to strip and reuse the chip up to five times for conventional hybridizations and the adaptability to inexpensive electrochemical scanning devices make these arrays a superb adjunct to real-time pcr by supporting multiplex assays and analyses in a single pcr tube rapid identification of upper respiratory pathogens followed by ha and na subtyping of influenza a viruses will significantly decrease the time and cost for the identification of potential lethal virus and bacterial strains and lead to better treatment and management of infections microarray and biosensor technologies show great promise for virus detection and genotyping and are needed for rapid vaccine development environmental screening and the detection of bioterrorism agents 14 15 20 30 31 targets were labeled by biotin incorporation during rt-pcr briefly 25 l reaction mixes included 125 l of reaction buffer invitrogen superscript iii one-step rt-pcr kit with platinum taq 2 l of 5 mm mgso4 07 l of 04 mm biotin-14-dctp invitrogen 2 l primer pool idt coralville ia 05 l enzyme mix 2 l rna or dna sample diluted in a solution containing 400 g yeast trna invitrogen and 96 g bsa neb per 10 ml of dh2o and 43 l dh2o thermal cycling parameters were 50c  30 min  1 cycle 94c  4 min  1 cycle 94c  30 s 56c  45 s 72c  45 s  40 cycles 94c  30 s 68c  60 s  30 cycles and 72c  5 min  1 cycle primers were designed so that the forward primer tm was approximately 50c and the reverse primer tm was approximately 65c influenza subtyping was accomplished with a universal forward primer with a 5 tag and thus the rt stage of amplification was set to 42c instead of 50c 5ctataggagcaaaagcagg amplification of target was confirmed by visualizing 30 l of each reaction product on 6 polyacrylamide gels invitrogen and staining with sybr green i molecular probes invitrogen initially microarrays were prehybridized for 30 min at 45c in 50 l of a solution consisting of 5 ml of 2  hybridization solution see below 1 ml of 50  denhardts solution sigma and 05 ml of 1 sds sigma for hybridization see fig 61 pcr reactions from primer pools were combined and mixed 11 with 2  hybridization buffer which consisted of 6 ml of 20  sspe ambion austin tx 01 ml of 10 tween 20 sigma 056 ml of 05 m edta ambion 05 ml of 1 sds sigma and 384 ml of dh2o ambion microarray hybridization chambers were filled 50 l volume and sealed with tape the arrays were incubated for 1 h at 45c with rotation in a hybridization oven fisher scientific pittsburgh pa and washed for 5 min at 45c with 3x sspe with 005 tween 20 twice with 2  pbs with 01 tween 20 pbst and then blocked for 5 min with 5  pbscasein biofx laboratories owing mills md for labeling microarrays were incubated for 30 min with extravidin peroxidase sigma diluted 11000 in bsa peroxidase stabilizer biofx arrays were washed twice with 2  pbst and twice with ph4 conductivity buffer substrate biofx tmb conductivity 1 component hrp microwell substrate biofx was added to the array and it was scanned immediately with an electrasense microarray reader combimatrix corp this instrument measures a at each of 12544 electrodes on the array in 25 s and outputs data in picoamps to a simple text file that can be used to create a pseudoimage or can be transferred to and graphed with an excel macro after hybridization to microarrays and data extraction by ecd graphs of mean subtype intensity values can be used to predict the correct pathogen genotype or subtype this information can next be broken down into subtype-subgroups this grouped data can then be used to cluster samples into like groups with alignment software this software treats each hybridization as an ordered list of intensities where the value at each position corresponds to the intensity of a unique probe a distance metric such as correlation allows for the determination of the difference between any two hybridization vectors next a similarity matrix is created containing the distances between all the hybridizations that are being compared this similarity matrix can then be used with several clustering programs such as the bioedit sequence alignment editor as diagrammed in fig 63

 sequence can also be reconstructed with array probe signal intensity data and then aligned with the most similar sequence in genbank fig 64 briefly sequence reconstruction software can take all the existing sequences in the database align them against the chip probe sequences and then create a probe profile for each sequence for each hybridization that is analyzed data are passed through these probe profiles and the probe profiles with the highest scores are chosen next sequence reconstruction proceeds within the small database containing the winning sequences by limiting the dataset resulting data have a lower background

short oligo probes for genotyping applications kwangsoo kim hong ryoo seo  specializing a general framework of logical analysis of data for efficiently handling large-scale genomic data we develop in this paper a probe design method for selecting short oligo probes for genotyping applications when tested on genomic sequences obtained from the national center of biotechnology information in various monospecific and polyspecific in silico experiments the proposed probe design method was able to select a small number of oligo probes of length 7 or 8 nucleotides that perfectly classified all unseen testing sequences these results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed probe design method and illustrate the usefulness and potential a well-designed optimization-based probe selection method has in genotyping applications  between november 1 2002 and july 31 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus infected 8096 people and proved fatal to 774 worldwide 1 the avian influenza ai virus subtype h5n1 alone infected 152 people worldwide between 2003 and january 2006 and 83 died of the disease 2 luckily none of the outbreaks of sars and ai infections at the beginning of the new millennium brought about the worst-case scenario alarmingly influenza experts seem to agree that another pandemic may be imminent webby and webster 2003 and as of this writing a fearful ai h5n1 virus continues to spread in part of asia and europe a microarray or a dna chip is a small glass or silica surface bearing dna probes probes are single stranded reverse transcribed mrnas each located at a specific spot of the chip for hybridization with its watson-crick complementary sequence in a target to form the double helix eg schena 1999 stears et al 2003  microarrays currently use two forms of probes namely oligonucleotide shortly oligo and cdna and have prevalently been used in the analysis of gene expression levels which measures the amount of gene expression in a cell by observing hybridization of mrna to different probes each targeting a specific gene with the ability to identify a specific target in a biological sample microarrays are also well suited for detecting biological agents for genetic and chronic disease eg eom et al 2004 heller et al 1997 lee and lee 2003 liu et al 2003  furthermore as viral pathogens can be detected at the molecular and genomic level much before the onset of physical symptoms in a patient the microarray technology can be used for an early detection of patients infected with viral pathogens eg sengupta et al 2003 vernet 2002 wang et al 2002 zhou et al 2005  the success of microarrays depends on the quality of probes that are tethered on the chip having an optimized set of probes is beneficial for two obvious reasons one the background hybridization is minimized hence true gene expression levels can be more accurately determined eg li and stormo 2001  the other as the number of oligos needed per gene is minimized the cost of each microarray is minimized or the number of genes on each chip is increased yielding oligo fingerprinting a much faster and more cost-efficient technique eg borneman et al 2001 li and stormo 2001  short probes consisting of 15-25 nucleotides nt are used in genotyping applications eg stears et al 2003  having short optimal probes means a high genotyping accuracy in terms of both sensitivity and specificity eg li and stormo 2001 sengupta et al 2003  hence can play a key role in genotyping applications for example in a pandemic an effective method for selecting short optimal probes may be used in the mass production of a cost-efficient device for screening for the disease in suspected or susceptible hosts reverse genetics would be the most rapid means by which to produce an antigenically matched vaccine in a pandemic webby and webster 2003  an effective probe selection methodology can identify conserved regions of a viral family and hence may prove useful in the preparation of a vaccine via reverse genetics furthermore the methodology can promote the availability of affordable home testing kits for accurate and confidential diagnosis of genetic and infectious disease and allow advanced and adequate medical treatment planning for patients a well-studied problem in machine learning and data mining deals with the discovery of a classification rule for different types of data the probe design say for genotyping applications can be roughly stated as selecting oligo probes for detecting a specific disease-agent in genomic sequences hence falls into the realm of classical classification thus far this interesting problem at the intersection of molecular biology and optimization has received relatively little attention from the optimization community and systematic oligo design methods proposed so far are based on a simple greedy procedure herwig et al 2000  the set covering-based classification methodology borneman et al 2001  support vector machines lee and lee 2003  an evolutionary algorithm eom et al 2004 lee et al 2004  and mixed integer and linear programming klau et al 2004  briefly summarizing from the perspective of numerical optimization genomic data present an unprecedented challenge for supervised learning approaches for a number of reasons to name a few first genomic data are long sequences over the nucleic acid alphabet  acgt second for example the complexity of viral flora owing to constantly evolving viral serotypes requires a supervised learning theory to be trained on a large collection of target and non-target samples that is a typical training set contains a large number of large-scale samples furthermore a supervised learning framework usually requires a systematic pairing or differencing between each target and non-target samples during the course of training a decision rule eg borneman et al 2001 boros et al 2000 klau et al 2004 rahmann 2003  owing to these and the nature of general data analysis and classification megiddo 1988  a supervised learning approach to classification of genomic data without specialized features for efficiently handling large-scale data is confronted by a formidable challenge based on a general framework of logical analysis of data lad from ryoo and jang 2005  we develop in this paper a probe design method for selecting short oligo probes of length l nt where l  6 10 to list some advantages of selecting oligo probes by the proposed method first the method selects probes via sequential solution of a small number of compact set covering sc instances which offers a great advantage from computational point of view to be more specific consider classification of two types of data and suppose that a training set is comprised of m  target and m  non-target sequences the size of the sc training instances solved by the proposed method is minimum of m  and m  orders of magnitude smaller than optimization learning models used in borneman et al 2001 and klau et al 2004  for instance second the method uses the sequence information only and selects probes via optimization based on principles of probability and statistics that is the probability of an l-mer oligo of length l appearing in a single sequence by chance is 025 l  unless statistically significant an lmer appearing in multiple samples of one type and none or only a few of the sequences of the other type by chance is extremely small third the proposed method does not rely on any extra tool such as blastn altschul et al 1990  a local sequence alignment search tool that is commonly used for probe selection eg sengupta et al 2003 wang et al 2002 wang and seed 2003  or the existence of pre-selected representative probes eg sengupta et al 2003  this makes the method truly stand-alone and free of problems that may possibly be caused by limitations associated with external factors as mentioned earlier the proposed probe design selects optimal probes via sequential solution of sc instances although sc is n p-complete garey and johnson 1979  its wide practical applications have invited an array of efficient meta-heuristic solution procedures to be developed therefore last the proposed method is readily implementable for efficient selection of oligo probes this paper is organized as follows in sect 2 we specialize a lad framework from ryoo and jang 2005 for efficiently analyzing genomic sequences and develop an effective method for selecting short oligo probes in sect 3 we test the proposed probe design algorithm in various in silico genotyping experiments using viral genomic sequences and report superb experimental results to summarize in all monospecific and polyspecific genotyping experiments on classification of viral pathogens using genomic sequences obtained from the national center of biotechnology information website the proposed probe design method selected a small number of probes of length 7 or 8 nt that perfectly classified all unseen testing sequences classifying the noisy human papillomavirus hpv sequences from the los alamos laboratory by high and low risk types the proposed probe design method selected optimal probes in a few cpu seconds that classified the testing sequences with 906 accuracy for comparison eom et al 2004 and park et al 2003 experimented with the same hpv dataset and reported the classification accuracy of 856 and 811 respectively these in silico results demonstrate efficacy and efficiency of the proposed oligo design method and further illustrate the usefulness and potential of a well-designed optimization-based probe design method in the forthcoming era of biotechnology finally sect 4 concludes the paper with a few remarks before proceeding we refer interested readers to schena 1999  stears et al 2003 and vernet 2002 for background in microarray analysis and its usage in the diagnosis of infectious disease furthermore as classification of more than two types of data can be accomplished by sequential classification of two types of data see for example cortes and vapnik 1995 ullman 1973 vapnik 1998 and sect 3 we present the material below in the context of the classification of  and  types of data for convenience and without loss of generality the backbone of the proposed procedure is lad lad is a relatively new supervised learning methodology that is based on boolean logic combinatorics and optimization a typical implementation of lad analyzes data on hand via four sequential stages of data binarization support feature selection pattern generation and classification rule formation as a boolean logic-based lad first converts all non-binary data into equivalent binary observations a   pattern in lad is defined as a conjunction of one or more binary attributes or their negations that distinguishes one or more   type observations from all   observations the number of attributes used in a pattern is called the degree of the pattern as seen from the definition patterns hold the structural information hidden in data after patterns are generated they are aggregated into a partially defined boolean discriminant functionrule to generalize the discovered knowledge to classify new observations referring readers to boros et al 2000  hammer 1986 and ryoo and jang 2005 for more background in lad we design a lad-based method below for efficiently handling and analyzing large-scale genomic data and selecting optimal oligo probes for genotyping applications let there be m  and m  sample observations of type  target and  non-target respectively for     let us use to denote the complementary element of  with respect to the set   let s  denote the index set of m  sample sequences for     a dna sequence is a sequence of nucleic acids a c g and t and the training sequences need to be converted into boolean sequences of 0 and 1 before lad can be applied toward this end we first choose an integer value for l usually l  6 10 see sect 3 generate all 4 l possible l-mers over the four nucleic acid letters and then number them consecutively from 1 to 4 l by a mapping scheme next each l-mer is selected in turn and every training sample is fingerprinted with the oligo for its presence or absence that is with oligo j we scan each sequence p i  i  s   s   from the beginning of the sequence and shifting to the right by a base and stamp after this the oligos that appear in all or none of the training sequences can be deleted from further consideration we re-number the surviving l-mers consecutively from 1 to n and replace the original training sequences described in the nucleic acid alphabets by their boolean representations let n  1     n the data are now described by n attributes a j  0 1 j  n  for observation p i  i  s       let p i j denote the binary value the j-th attribute takes in this observation denote by l j the literal of binary attribute a j  then l j  a j l j  a j  instructs to take negate the value of a j in all sequences a term t is a conjunction of literals given a term t let n t  n denote the index of literals included in the term then we have t  jn t l j  a  pattern is a term that satisfies t  p i   l j a j  jn t p i j l j  j  jn tp i j  1 for at least one p i  i  s   and t  p k   0 for all p k  k  s note here that n t of a  pattern identifies probes that collectively distinguish one or more  sequences from the sequences of the other type to aid in presentation let us temporarily introduce n additional features a n j  j  n  and use a n j to negate a j  let n  1     2n and let us introduce a binary decision variable x j for a j  j  n  to determine whether to include l j in a pattern ryoo and jang 2005 formulated a compact mixed integer and linear programming milp model below with respect to a reference sample p i  i  s       proof first via the first constraint of milp-2i   and the definition of j i  we trivially have for the reference observation p i  i  s   next the second set of hard constraints yields that at least one of p l j  0 for j  n t for each p l  l  s this gives for all p l  l  s and completes the proof lemma 1 shows that any feasible solution of milp-2i   can be used to form a  pattern now note that if y l  0 for l  s   i in the solution then the  pattern p formed also distinguishes p l from the observations therefore with the objective of minimizing the sum of y l s the milp model can be understood as a way to generate a  pattern that distinguishes more or less a maximum number of  observations from the observations as easily seen the number of 1s in the optimal solution determines the degree of the pattern generated as demonstrated in ryoo and jang 2005  this model efficiently generates patterns of all degree with equal ease provided that the number of training samples used is moderate and that n is not a big number genomic data are large-scale in nature however furthermore owing to constantly evolving viral serotypes the complexity of viral flora is high and this requires large numbers of target and non-target viral samples to be used for selecting optimal genotyping probes adding to these the difficulties associated with numerical solution of milp in general we see that milp-2i   presents no practical way of selecting genotyping probes with the need to develop a more efficient pattern generation scheme we select a reference sequence p i  i  s       and set for k  s and j  n  next we set for l  s  and j  n  now consider the set covering model where c j  j  n  are positive real numbers refer to remark 4 theorem 1 let x y denote a feasible solution of sc  i  then forms a  lad pattern proof to show the result we need to show that the conjunction of literals formed via 2 distinguishes at least one  observation from all observations toward the end recall that p ik  10 indicates the presence absence and the absence presence of probe k in the reference sequence selected p i  i  s   and in p k  k  s respectively with the cover x y of sc  i  on hand let us subdivide the index set n t   j  n  observe now that  1 implies that exactly one of p i j and p k j equals 1 for p i and p k  k  s the cover x y of sc  i  by definition satisfies all constraints of sc  i  and the hard constraints of the problem in the first set of cover inequalities require that at least one x l in the cover is set to 1 among l  n with a ik l  1 for all k  s this in turn implies that at least one p kl for l  n 1 t or p il for l  n 0 t equals 0 for all p k  k  s and yields note that p generated on the solution x y of sc  i  via 2 also satisfies p p l   1 for all l  s   i with y l  0 the following result is immediate is also formulated in reference to p i for some i  s  and finds a cover that distinguishes most  observations from the observations therefore although not identical sc  i  can be seen as an sc version of milp-2i   although smaller than the milp model by only one constraint and one integer variable sc  i  has a much simpler structure and is defined only in terms of 0-1 variables in addition owing to having a wide range of practical applications sc has invited the development of an array of efficient meta-heuristic solution procedures eg caprara et al 1999 and references therein and any of these can be used for solving sc  i  refer to remark 1 from the computational point of view therefore sc  i  is much preferred over its milp counterpart note that sc  i  is defined by m   m   1 cover inequalities and n  m   1 binary variables also recall that n is large for genomic sequences and the analysis of viral sequences requires large numbers of target and non-target sequences that is m  and m  are also large numbers to develop a more compact sc-based probe selection model we select a reference sequence p i  i  s       and set the values of a ik j for k  s and j  n via 1 consider the following sc model where c j s are positive reals again refer to remark 4 theorem 2 let x denote a feasible solution of sc-pg  i  then p generated on x via 2 forms a  lad pattern proof same as the proof for theorem 1 we immediately have the following result that can be used for efficiently identifying the  observations that are also distinguished from the observations by the pattern generated on the solution of sc-pg  i  lemma 3 with a feasible solution x of sc-pg  i  generate a  pattern p via 2 then p distinguishes every  sequence p l  l  s   with p lk  p ik for all k  n t from the observations where n t   j  n  x j  1 note that sc-pg  i  can be considered as a relaxation of sc  i  to see this project sc  i  onto the space of x generally speaking therefore a feasible solution of sc  i  has more x j s set to 1 in it than in a feasible solution of sc  i  formulated on the same data hence tends to generate a higher degree pattern that generally explains a difference between the target and non-target sequences as more  observations are distinguished from the observations at a time by a solution of sc  i  it is formulated and solved for a less number of times for generating a set of  patterns that collectively distinguish all  observations from the data in a dataset under analysis refer to the oligo selection procedure detailed below on the other hand sc-pg  i  generates per solution a lower degree pattern that explains the specific difference between the reference  observation and the sequences and hence is formulated and solved for a more number of times for generating a set of  patterns overall the two models select about the same number of probes however as sc-pg  i  is much smaller in size hence is more efficiently solved and because a high specificity is desired in genotyping applications we prefer sc-pg  i  for selecting genotyping oligo probes using sc-pg  i  we design one simple oligo probe selection procedure below where p  denotes the set of  patterns generated so far the following is immediate theorem 3 procedure sc-pg terminates finitely a few remarks are due now remark 1 simply put the number of 1s in the covers generated via procedure sc-pg determines the number of probes to be used for a specific genotyping purpose in other words the quality of an sc solution determines the cost of genotyping applications sc is a well-known n p-complete problem garey and johnson 1979  owing to having a wide range of practical applications despite its simple structure sc has invited an array of meta-heuristic solution procedures to be developed for its efficient heuristic solution eg caprara et al 1999 and references therein and any of these can be used for solving sc-pg  i  in fact the genotyping accuracy is not affected at all as long as the covers found are near-optimal and good enough see results in the following section and this was the rationale behind our developing sc-based probe selection models in this paper recall that probe selection is a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem in nature furthermore the efficiency of sc heuristic solution procedures allows one to apply procedure sc-pg or the similar directly to the binarized data to generate patterns without going through the feature selection phase this is another benefit the sc-based pattern generation offers over its milp counterparts from ryoo and jang 2005 or the standard term-enumeration-based procedure for generating patterns in the lad literature eg boros et al 2000  i  has all zero coefficients the sc instance is infeasible this case arises when the reference sequence p i  i  s   and the sequence p j  j  s have identical 0-1 fingerprints which is a contradiction supervised learning methodologies including lad presume for the existence of a classification function that each unique sequence in the training set belongs to exactly one of the two classes when this holds contradiction-free 0-1 clones of the original data can always be obtained by using oligos of longer length for data binarization remark 3 if desired the hybridization affinity of probes can be ensured in a number of ways including the following first during data binarization one can remove from further consideration each l-mer with the gc content less than a prescribed level or with the melting temperature calculated via for example the formula found in wang and seed 2003 that falls outside a certain prescribed range from the median melting temperature of all l-mers generated next the proposed lad-based method can be applied to select an optimal set of probes on the surviving l-mers that are compatible in terms of their hybridization behavior i  is a general-purpose model and can be specialized to select a minimal set of optimal oligo probes by any quantifiable probe selection criterion for example one may use the longest common factors from rahmann 2003 or the ovl scores from herwig et al 2000 for c j values in sg-pg  i  to select probes by the dis-similarity preference one may use for example the shannon entropy scores from herwig et al 2000 for c j s and incorporate the complexity of oligos in probe selection denote by p  1      p  n  and p  1      p  n  the positive and negative patterns respectively generated via procedure sc-pg in classifying unseen  target and  non-target sequences we use three decision rules first in polyspecific genotyping applications see for example experiment 4 in sect 32 we form the standard lad classification rule boros et al 2000  where   i denotes the number of  training sequences covered by p  i and assign class   to new sequence p if  p  0   p  0 we fail to classify sequence p if  p  0 for the monospecific genotyping we use a strict classification rule specifically for classification of two viral sub-types see for example experiment 1 in sect 32 we form a decision rule by and assign p to class  if   p  0 while   p  0 when   p  0 and   p  0 or when   p  0 and   p  0 we fail in classifying the sequence for the monospecific classification of more than two viral sub-types k  1     m see for example experiment 7 in sect 32 we use the decision rule where p k 1      p k n k are the probes selected to for virus sub-type k and assign p to class k if k  p  0 while i  p  0 for all i  1     m i  k when  p  0 for more than two virus types or k  0 for all k then we fail to assign a class to sequence p in this section we extensively test the proposed probe design for classification of viral disease-agents in in silico setting to make these experiments as realistic as possible we design each of these experiments based on information from the literature and the official website of the world health organization who and use viral genomic sequences obtained from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi and human papillomavirus hpv sequences from the los alamos national laboratory to be more specific about the data used we obtained the hpv data from the los alamos national laboratory site for illustrative and comparative purposes these data correspond to the 72 high and low risk hpv sequences that are used in eom et al 2004 and park et al 2003  although some of these manually classified virus sequences contain classification errors eom et al 2004  we used the data with table 1  we provide the number and the length the minimum average  1 standard deviation and maximum length of each type of the genomic data used in our experiments in analyzing data in an experiment we first decided on a length of oligos to use by calculating the smallest integer value l such that 4 l became larger than or equal to the average of the lengths of target and non-target sequences of the experiment then 4 l candidate oligos were generated to fingerprint and binarize the data if the length of oligos turned out to be not long enough during the pattern generation stage see remark 2 the data binarization stage was repeated with the value of l incremented by 1 and this process was repeated until the binary representations of the data became contradiction free next procedure sc-pg was applied to generate patterns hence probes in applying procedure sc-pg in these in silico experiments we did not consider any oligo picking criterion that is non-theoretical in nature refer to remark 4 and selected a minimal set of oligo probes with using c j  1 for all j  n  for solving the unicost sc-pg  i s generated we used for ease of implementation the textbook heuristic procedure eg nemhauser and wolsey 1988  that selects one variable at a time by the rule where i j denotes the index of rows k with a ik j  1 and m u denotes the set of rows that are not yet covered by the partial cover x on hand in each of the experiments in this section in order to fairly assess the classification capabilities of oligo probes selected by the proposed probe design procedure we 1 randomly selected 90 of the target and of the non-target data to form a training set of sequences 2 binarized the training data 3 selected optimal oligo probes on the training data via procedure sc-pg 4 formed a classification rule by one of 3 4 and 5 with the selected oligo probes 5 used the classification rule to sub-type each of the reserved testing sequences consisting of the remaining 10 of the target and the non-target sequences and 6 repeated steps above 20 times to obtain the average testing performance and other relevant information of the experiment the computational platform used for experiments was an intel 266ghz pentium linux pc with 512mb of memory infection with hpv is the main cause of cervical cancer the second most common cancer in women worldwide bosch et al 2002 muoz et al 2003  there are more than 80 identified types of hpv and the genital hpv types are subdivided into high and low risk types low risk hpv types are responsible for most common sexually transmitted viral infections while high risk hpv types are a crucial etiological factor for the development of cervical cancer eg mcfadden and schumann 2001  we applied the proposed probe design method on the 72 hpv sequences downloaded from the los alamos national laboratory with their classification found in table 3 of park et al 2003  the selected probes were used to form a decision rule by 3 and tested for their classification capability results from this polyspecific probe selection experiment are provided in table 2  in this and the other tables in this section the target  and the non-target  virus types of the experiments are specified in the first column then the tables provide two bits of information on the candidate oligos namely the length l and the average and the standard deviation of the number of features generated and used in the 20 runs of each experiment for data binarization and for pattern generation recall that we skip the feature selection stage of lad see remark 1 provided next in the tables is the information on the number of probes selected in the format the average  1 standard deviation and information on the lad patterns generated finally the testing performance of the probes selected is provided in the format the average  1 standard deviation of the percentage of the correct classifications of the unseen sequences briefly summarizing the proposed probe design method selected probes on the hpv data in a few cpu seconds that tested 906 accurate in classifying unseen hpv samples for comparison the same hpv dataset was used in eom et al 2004 and park et al 2003 for the classification of hpv by high and low risk types in brief the probe design methods of eom et al 2004 and park et al 2003 required several cpu hours of computation and selected probes that obtained 856 and 811 correct classification rates respectively before moving on we note that the sequences belonging to the target and the nontarget groups in this experiment all have different hpv subtypes see table 3 in park et al 2003  the combination of all target and non-target sequences being different from one another and the presence of noise in the data the classification errors gave rise to selecting a relatively large number of polyspecific probes in this experiment the proposed probe design method was extensively tested on genomic viral sequences from ncbi for selecting monospecific and polyspecific probes for screening for sars and ai in a number of different binary and multicategory experimental setting and performed superbly on all counts we summarize the results from some of these experiments in this section before proceeding we briefly illustrate the benefit of probe selection via sc-pg  i  from the computational point of view with experiment 5 below for the purpose let us first recall that probe selection is a combinatorial optimization problem therefore for the selection of oligo probes for differentiating lethal ai virus h5 and h9 from the other ai virus h subtypes in experiment 5 a supervised learning method based on a complete pairwise differencing of the target and non-target training sequences eg borneman et al 2001 boros et al 2000 klau et al 2004 rahmann 2003 a in format average  standard deviation b percentage of correct classifications of testingunseen data would require solving one or more combinatorial optimization problems with between 148931376607765  226 299 and 137660148779365  623  10 12 rows refer to table 1 above for the numbers of the target and non-target viral sequences and with at least 39 056 0-1 decision variables see table 7 for the average number of lmers generated in this experiment for experiment 5 we note in comparison that the largest sc-pg  i  instance generated and solved by procedure sc-pg had max148  93 137  660  77  65  939 rows and 39 056 columns sars virus is phylogenetically most closely related to group 2 coronavirus snijder et al 2003  105 sars sequences and 39 coronavirus samples were used to select 1 monospecific probe for screening for sars used in a classification rule 4 the sars probe and one probe selected for coronavirus together perfectly classified all testing sequences see table 3  this experiment simulates a sars pandemic where suspected patients with sarslike symptoms are screened for the disease we used the 105 sars virus sequences and 107 samples of other influenza virus types the other virus in table 1  in this experiment and selected polyspecific probes used in a classification rule 3 these probes collectively gave the perfect classification of all testing sequences see table 4  ai virus h7n7 is highly pathogenic with the capacity to pass from human-to-human and this raised concerns for a possible viral reassortment with human influenza h1n1 and h3n2 strains during a large outbreak of h7n7 infection in the netherlands in 2003 koopmans et al 2004 webby and webster 2003  based on information from koopmans et al 2004  we replicated the classification of h7 and other influenza virus h subtypes in this experiment by using 77 h7 sequences and 1103 other h subtype samples polyspecific probes were selected and tested in a classification rule 3 to give the perfect classification rate see table 5  h5 and h7 have an ominous capacity to pass from human to human httpwww whoint webby and webster 2003  this experiment using 225 h5 and h7 viral samples and 955 other h subtype sequences selected polyspecific probes for detecting the two pathogenic h subtypes of the ai virus from the other influenza virus h subtypes and vice versa a classification rule was formed by 3 for testing the selected probes and we obtained the perfect testing result see table 6  experiment 5 classification of lethal ai virus h5 and h9 and other influenza virus h subtypes ai virus h5 and h9 subtypes cause a most fatal form of the disease koopmans et al 2004  and they were separated from the other h subtypes of influenza virus in this experiment 241 h5 and h9 target sequences and 939 other h subtype sequences were used to select polyspecific probes for detecting ai virus h5 and h9 subtypes from the rest in a classification rule 3 the selected probes collectively classified all testing sequences correctly see table 7  monospecific classification of sars human influenza h1 human influenza h3 ai h5 and ai h7 virus this multicategory classification experiment selects monospecific probes for distinguishing one from another a few notorious viral pathogens we used 103 sars virus 137 human influenza virus h1 660 human influenza virus h3 148 lethal ai virus h5 and 77 pathogenic ai virus h7 sequences and selected monospecific probes for each virus type in sequential binary classification of one type against the rest the selected probes were tested in a classification rule 5 to classify the testing sequences p by a strict decision rule of assign class i to p only if one or more probes selected for virus type i is found in p while none of the probes selected for the other types are not and gave the perfect classification result see table 8  note that only a small number of monospecific probes were selected as in experiment 1 monospecific classification of n1 n2 and n3 influenza virus the statement monospecific neuraminidase na subtype probes were insufficiently diverse to allow confident na subtype assignment from sengupta et al 2003 motivated us to design this experiment on multicategory and monospecific classification of influenza virus by n subtypes we used the three influenza virus n subtypes with 30 or more samples in table 1 and selected monospecific probes for their classification tested in a classification rule 5 the selected probes performed perfectly in classifying all testing sequences see table 9  note again that only a small number of monospecific probes were selected and proved needed in this experiment as in the other two monospecific genotyping experiments experiments 1 and 6 the problem of probe design for hybridization-based experiments is an interesting problem lying at the intersection of molecular biology and optimization but has received relatively little attention from the or community in this paper we specialized a general lad framework from ryoo and jang 2005 for efficiently handling 3  0 d e g r e e1 100  0 n2 37  05 degree 1 only

short oligo probes for genotyping applications extensively tested on genomic sequences obtained from the national center of biotechnology information and the los alamos national laboratory in various monospecific and polyspecific in silico experiments the proposed probe design method was able to select a small number of oligo probes of length 7 or 8 nucleotides that performed superbly in classifying unseen testing sequences these in silico results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed oligo design method experimental results further illustrate a huge potential a well-designed optimization-based probe design method has in hybridization-based genotyping applications collaborative research activities are planned to realize the in silico performance of the proposed probe

1976 russian flu 1977 the current year 2009 has been marked by a late season pandemic-scale emergence of a novel ah1n1 outbreak strain raising immediate concerns for public health as well as for pork and poultry production industries worldwide as with the few common subtypes of human type a influenza viruses there are similarly few subtypes of type a influenza viruses that are associated with most influenza infections of swine horses or dogs in distinct contrast wildfowl species are natural hosts and a global reservoir for the majority of possible influenza ahn subtypes many of these variant strains appear to be associated with endemic infections often asymptomatic in avian hosts 1 incidental infections of humans by avian influenza viruses have been documented for avian influenza subtypes ah5n1 ah7n2 ah7n3 ah7n7 ah9n2 ah10n7 and ah11n9 recent outbreaks of bird flu may foreshadow an eventual pandemic outbreak in the emergence of strains and variants with enhanced pathogenicity virulence and transmissibility in human hosts examples of such outbreaks include ah5n1 hong kong 1997 h9n2 hong kong 1999 ah7n7 netherlands 2003 ah5n1 southeast asia 2004 some avian ah5 and ah7 strains of influenza virus are recognized as highly pathogenic hp in domestic poultry and concerns arise that this phenotype may carry over to infections of humans since 1997 human infections associated with the eurasian-african lineage of ah5n1 hp avian influenza virus have been associated with 467 documented cases in 15 countries with high mortality 282 deaths 2 updated 30 december 2009 fortunately infectious transmission of such avian influenza virus strains between humans continues to be limited however history suggests that further evolution of these or other type a influenza strains could emerge as a next pandemic strain similarly variant type a influenza virus strains have emerged from time to time imposing serious costs and burdens upon poultry and livestock production because the natural history and the molecular biology of influenza viruses reflect such viral genome diversity there is a critical need for rapid sensitive specific and informative assays to detect and characterize any subtype of influenza virus benchmark standard methods that employ propagation of virus in cell culture or in embryonating chicken eggs with assays using panels of specific serological reagents or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr-based assays using panels of short oligonucleotide primers and probes are either slow and time consuming or expensive as prevailing strains of avian influenza continue to evolve and diverge diagnostic assays that are based only on specific recognition of short signature sequences or peptide biomarker loci will increasingly fail

at wwwtessaraecom the rpm-flu assay protocol is executed as a series of specimen and sample processing steps listed below and indicating approximate time required for each step the abbreviated 4-hour hybridization time 5 above reduces assay cycle time to single day which may be helpful if same-day test results are a critical consideration the overnight 16 hour hybridization time is recommended and preferred to optimize both assay sensitivity and the quality and lengths of assay-generated gene sequences from detected target pathogens analysis of rpm-flu assay data now differs from earlier reported through the development of the prototype assay platform rpmv1 4 5 each rpm-flu assay of a specimen generates sequence data as base calls a g c or t across each detector tile of affymetrix customseq-formatted microarrays 6 see affymetrix technical note 2006 genechip customseq resequencing array base calling algorithm version 20 performance in homozygous and heterozygous snp detection image data acquired from genechip instrument system scanning under genechip operating software control is translated by gseq sequence analysis software affymetrix inc santa clara ca tessarray sequence analysis tseq software evaluates a c3 score for each rpm-flu detector tile as a metric of detected dna sequence quantity and quality the c3 score is the total number of gseq-identified nucleotides that appear in runs of three or more consecutive non-n base calls expressed as percentage of the length nucleotides of each rpm-flu detector tile sequence this approach to definition of a detected sequence reduces background noise from spurious false-positive hybridizations of 25-base oligonucleotide probes that could lead to isolated and relatively uninformative single base calls relaxed and stringent target pathogen detection and reporting thresholds for the rpm-flu assay have been statistically and empirically established for all of the resequencing detector tiles at c3 score 10 or c3 score 20 respectively rpm-flu assay results from hundreds of clinical and field specimens as well as laboratory reference strains and synthetic dna templates aggregate data not shown have demonstrated that these detection thresholds often represent c3 scores that are more than 6 standard deviations 6 p0000003 above the mean of c3 scores from thousands of detector tiles from assays performed in the absence of positive control templates all sequences from an rpm-flu assay that meet a detection and reporting threshold are automatically subjected to alignment-based search of the tessarray validated reference sequence database vrsd most recently validated instance 10 august 2009 using a dedicated server-based implementation of the basic local alignment search tool blast version 2217 7 this

return one or more most similar sequence records from the search database as tessaraes vrsd that are concordant with the identity of the tentatively identified target pathogen suggested by the identity of the particular resequencing detector tile aliquots from two throat swab specimens collected during the 20082009 influenza were used for propagation of stocks by infection of mdck cell cultures infected culture lysates were then diluted for infections of replicate shell vial cultures to determine infectious titers performed by virapur san diego ca the resulting stocks of brd10622nh1n1 and brd10601h3n2 were determined to contain 316107 tcid50ml and 178107 tcid50ml respectively serial ten-fold dilutions of viral stocks for rpm-flu assays were prepared using fresh cell culture media as diluent from 100 neat to 103 and then three-fold dilutions were prepared from 13000 to 12187000 the routine rpm-flu protocol for total nucleic extraction and purification was performed on each of the triplicate diluted samples of the viral stocks for identity-blinded triplicate rpm-flu assays the influenza virus subtype ah1 gene detector tile ha1h1n1 on the rpm-flu microarray is an array of 11808 resequencing oligonucleotide probes 25-mers representing the nucleotides 113 through 1588 of the anew caledonia2099 h1n1 strain hemagglutinin gene genbank accession number ay289929 this is the actual ah1n1 strain of influenza virus representing the viral ha1 gene product in the 20042005 vaccine configuration an aliquot of flumist vaccine 20042005 was subjected to rpm-flu assay from which 1351 specific base calls were determined across the ha1h1n1 detector tile resulting in c3 score  915 blast analysis returned ay289929 anew caledonia2099 h1n1 as the most similar sequence record from alignment-based search across the entire genbank with the limit minimum expectation value of 00 or e-value  10e-180 
figure 2 shows the alignment of a 540-nucleotide segment of this rpm-flu assay detected sequence below corresponding intervals of the rpm-flu detector tile sequence this part of the rpm-flu ha1h1n1 detector tile spans the locus of the ah1 hemagglutinin peptide cleavage site 8 each of the nine successive 60 bp rpm-flu assay-detected ha1 sequence segments shown in the inset was subjected to blast alignment and similarity analysis these short query sequences 60 bp are identical matches to corresponding hemagglutinin sequence segments of many different ah1n1 isolates but in each case the list of identical sequence records returned by blast includes one or more anew caledonia2099 h1n1 records this includes those 60 bp lines with runs of up to 12 uncalled bases n with the exception of small gaps of uncalled bases the detected sequence is identical to the prototype sequence of the rpm-flu ha1h1n1 detector tile this example of the integrity of rpm-flu assay-generated target pathogen gene sequencing for detection and identification is reinforced by results for the other specific hemagglutinin neuraminidase and matrix gene sequences from the same rpm-flu assay of the same aliquot of flumist vaccine table 1 shows that the most similar sequence records returned from blast analysis of assay-generated ha1 na1 ha3 na2 mh1n1 mh3n2 gene sequences as well as type b ha na and m gene sequences all correctly correspond to the actual influenza virus strains used to represent these components in the 20042005 vaccine configuration this result is achieved even for instances ha3 na2 b-ha b-na and both the type a and type b m genes where the rpm-flu detector tile sequences and actual vaccine gene sequences do not precisely match this reflects the robust capability of the rpm-flu resequencing microarray to determine accurately the match or alternative mismatch of each target gene nucleotide relative to corresponding nucleotide of the detector sequence these results also demonstrate the non-interference of similar assay targets for rpm-flu detection and identification of multiple target gene sequences from the same specimen similarly specific typing subtyping and strain identification results to those shown in table 1 have been obtained from analyses of live and inactivated influenza vaccines configured for the 20052006 20062007 and 20092010 seasons results presented as supplemental information tables s1 s2 s3 and s4 we note that results of assays using inactivated influenza virus vaccines identify detected type a matrix gene sequences are most closely and correctly matched by matrix gene sequence records from the apuerto rico834 h1n1 master donor strain that is used for gene segment re-assortment to select for the inactivated vaccine strains the results in table 1 are similar to those presented by wang et al 9 that reports table 4 that earlier work was performed using the rpmv1 prototype precursor platform of the tessarray rpm-flu 31 the rpmv1 allocated only 7691 base pairs bp to 9 different influenza-specific detector tiles compared with the rpm-flu assay that allocates 41063 bp over 40 influenza virus-specific detector tiles see figure 1 the prototype rpmv1 assay also employed random primers in a reverse transcription and pcr-like protocol for total rna amplification and did not apply the c3 quantityquality metric methodology described in this report for analysis of rpm-flu assay-detected target pathogen gene sequences 
table 2 presents ha na and m gene detector tile c3 scores from rpm-flu assays of samples representing prevalent human subtypes ah1n1 ah3n2 and type b influenza viruses inactivated trivalent influenza virus vaccine and selected ahn subtypes of type a avian influenza viruses c3 scores that failed to meet or exceed the rpm-flu assay detection and reporting thresholds are shown in parentheses and in smaller font size to distinguish them from c3 scores representing positive detection and identification of one or more of the rpm-flu assay-targeted influenza viruses except for the vaccine sample assays of each sample reported sequences from only one hemagglutinin detector tile and one neuraminidase detector tile those corresponding precisely to the specimens ahn subtype or b type the mean values of c3 scores from the positive detector tiles in table 2 and the background negative detector tiles are respectively mean c3pos  737240 n  22 mean c3neg  3223 n  261 a six-sigma 6 detection threshold for this data set is c3  170 the lowest positive control result from this data set was for the na gene of the nhrc-type b influenza virus-positive specimen c3pos  137 the same assay of this specimen generated higher c3 scores for sequences from the b-ha c3  31 and b-m c3  34 detector tiles that exceeded the stringent detection threshold the type b-na sequence from the assay met the relaxed detection threshold c3 score 10 in part because blast analysis of the sequence returned nine most similar type b influenza virus na gene sequence records this corroborated a tentative detection report relaxed threshold that might have been made on the basis of the na gene resequencing result alone the specimen was collected in 2006 at u s army fort leonard wood mo and each of these most similar sequence records represented a na gene from various circulating type b influenza virus strains collected during the same influenza season the rpm-flu microarray includes four influenza virus matrix gene detector tiles representing matrix gene sequences from selected reference strains of ah1n1human ah3n2human ah5n1avian and bhuman types and subtypes the results in table 2 demonstrate specific discrimination and no apparent crosstalk between the three type a and the one type b matrix gene detectors however for each of the human and avian subtypes of type a influenza viruses it is generally the case that all three of the corresponding type a matrix gene detector tiles generate very similar and overlapping specimen-specific matrix gene sequences we have reviewed the lists of most similar sequence records returned by blast analysis of rpm-flu assay-generated gene sequences from 12 different human seasonal ah1n1 strains and 31 different human seasonal ah3n2 strains among rpm-flu assay results from the 12 ah1n1 samples there were 478 800 201 348 and 312 most similar sequence records returned from blast analysis of sequences generated from the ha1h1n1 na1h1n1 mh1n1 mh3n2 and nsh5n1 detector tiles respectively without exception each of these most similar sequence records represents an ah1n1 strain including the 660 sequence records found to match the rpm-flu sequences generated from the rpm-flu mh3n2 and nsh5n1 detector tiles among the 31 ah3n2 samples there were 754 189 1267 and 1678 most similar sequence records returned from the ha3h3n2 na2h3n3 mh1n1 and mh3n2 detector tiles respectively and every one of these sequence records represents an ah3n2 strain however the ns h5n1 detector tile generated 109 specimen-specific ns gene sequences from several of the ah3n2 samples and only 19 of the most ns gene sequence records were from ah3n2 strains the other ns gene sequence records that were found by blast to be most similar to the sequences generated from assays of ah3n2 specimens represent subtypes ah2n2 12 ah1n1 73 ah11n9 2 ah6n2 2 and ah3n6 1 these results suggest that circulating strains of subtype ah3n2 harbor diverse ns gene sequences variations that presumably arise from frequent co-infections and genome segment reassortments in the field on the other hand the subtype ah1n1 specimens led to rpm-flu assay-generated ns gene sequences that are most similar to ns gene sequence records associated with subtype ah1n1 strains although it appears that the rpm-flu assay-generated m gene sequences may have some utility to differentiate human ah1n1 and human ah3n2 subtypes the ns gene sequences do not appear to be so reliable for the purpose of inferring ahn subtype this consideration will appear again later in results with the subject of indirect inferred ahn subtyping of type a avian influenza viruses the rpm-flu assay was implemented in a blinded analysis of several hundred clinical specimens from the respiratory infectious disease archives at nhrc selected throat swab specimens had been collected over the period 20052007 from basic military trainees at several installations in the united states the subjects were evaluated at the time of specimen collection and associated with one of three cohorts apparently healthy and afebrile individuals those diagnosed with febrile respiratory illness fri and those diagnosed with pneumonia confirmed by chest x-ray a group of 298 specimens were analyzed using both the rpm-flu assay and a validated benchmark rt-pcr assay for type a influenza virus described by freed et al 10 thirty specimens were identified as positive for type a influenza virus by both assays and only 1 specimen was found to be negative by rpm-flu and positive by rt-pcr the remaining 267 specimens were found to be negative for influenza virus by both assays all of the influenza-positive specimens were from participants that had been assigned to the fri cohort 
table 3 shows the calculation of high clinical sensitivity 97 and even higher clinical specificity 100 of rpm-flu for detection and identification of type a human influenza virus compared with results from testing the same specimens with the benchmark rt-pcr-based assay similarly high clinical sensitivity and high clinical specificity of rpm-flu have been demonstrated with in the same ensemble of clinical specimens with respect to other simultaneously targeted pathogens of the assay when similarly robust rt-pcr test panels were used for benchmark testing of matched specimens eg human adenoviruses of subgroups b1 b2 and e mycoplasma pneumoniae results not shown the benchmark rt-pcr type a influenza virus test used to assess clinical sensitivity and specificity of the rpm-flu assay does not distinguish between the ah1n1 and ah3n2 subtypes however the rpm-flu assay is capable of simultaneous and mutually exclusive identification of a detected type a influenza virus as either seasonal subtype ah1n1 or seasonal subtype ah3n2 results presented in table 4 demonstrate this capability for the 30 specimens representing subtype ah1n1 5 specimens or subtype ah3n2 25 specimens differentiation of the two prevalent subtypes is primarily based upon identification of assay-generated ha and na sequences as matching ha1 or ha3 andor na1 or na2 respectively a secondary inference of ahn subtype may be based on which of the m gene detectors mh1n1 or mh3n2 has the higher c3 score these indications of type a human influenza subtype are completely concordant with the corresponding subtypes associated with the most similar m gene sequence records from blast analysis of the sequences generated from both the mh1n1 and the mh3n2 detector tiles in the course of increasing prevalence of oseltamivir-resistant strains of ah1n1 and amantadine-resistant strains of ah3n2 the nhrc has implemented a new rt-pcr panel to determine the ah1 or ah3 subtype for specimens already shown to be type a influenza virus-positive by the earlier rt-pcr panel david metzgar chris myers personal communication they have also validated the assay by demonstrating concordance of subtyping results from new rt-pcr panel with a cell culturehemagglutinin immunofluorescence assay hai type b influenza virus-positive specimens identified from the first tier rt-pcr typing panel were negative controls for the second tier rt-pcr-based type a subtyping panel twelve isolates from the 20082009 influenza season six each testing positive for ah1 or ah3 by the rt-pcr panel and also by culture-hai were selected for rpm-flu analysis all of the specimens tested definitively positive in the initial and only necessary rpm-flu assay as either ah1n1 or ah3n2 matching the results of both the rt-pcr and hai benchmark ah1 and ah3 assays these results are summarized in table 5 reinforcing the point of mutually exclusive detection and identification of specimen-specific gene sequences from the ha1 and na1 detector tiles as ah1n1 or from the ha3 and na2 detector tiles as ah3n2 the results for m gene sequences from both the mh1n1 and the mh3n2 detector tiles for both sets of specimens shown in table 5 again display significant crosstalk as overlapping and highly similar assay-generated sequences in every example the two m gene sequences of an individual specimen generated from the mh1n1 and mh3n2 gene detector tiles are consistent with the ahn subtype directly indicated the ha and na gene sequences generated in the same rpm-flu assay of the same specimen all 30 of the influenza-positive specimens described above were also reported by the individual rpm-flu assays to be positive for at least one and up to six other viral andor bacterial respiratory pathogens including adenovirus rhinovirus coronavirus moraxella catarrhalis staphylococcus aureus streptococcus agalactiae haemophilus influenzae neisseria meningitidis pseudomonas spp streptococcus mitis and streptococcus pneumoniae there was no obvious correlation of the distributions of other co-infecting pathogens with the particular subtype of infecting influenza virus or with particular specimen collection venues there was no data on clinical presentation or outcomes to correlate with particular states of co-infections we considered whether or not there may be interference with the detection and identification of specific influenza viruses in specimens that test positive in rpm-flu assays for other viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens the background distribution of c3 scores for detection and identification of influenza viruses was estimated from rpm-flu assays of 14 different blank samples water or transport media negative controls the average c3 score of the 39 type a and type b influenza virus detector tiles to be 1711 n  14 results not shown another set of 25 specimens were found to be negative for influenza virus by both rpm-flu and benchmark rt-pcr tests while the same rpm-flu assays reported the specimens to be positive with apparently high load c3 score75 of at least one other viral or bacterial respiratory pathogen results not shown simultaneous pathogen targets of the rpm-flu assay that apparently do not interfere with detection and identification of influenza viruses include adenovirus types ad4 ad7 coronavirus strains oc43 229e nl63 rhinovirus types a b metapneumovirus types a b parainfluenzavirus types 1 2 3 respiratory syncytial virus rsv types a b chlamydophila pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae klebsiella pneumoniae moraxella catarrhalis mycoplasma pneumoniae neisseria meningitidis pseudomonas aeruginosa staphylococcus aureus including mrsa strains streptococcus agalactiae streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes the 25 ah3n2-positive clinical specimens from the ensemble of 298 specimens described in the preceding section were collected between january 2007 and march 2007 at five different military basic training venues great lakes naval training station il marine corps recruit depot ca army fort leonard wood mo army fort jackson sc army fort benning ga all but one of the rpm-flu assay-generated ha3 gene sequences were most similar to blast-returned sequence records of ah3n2 isolates that nelson et al 11 associated with either major clade a from the 20062007 influenza outbreaks in the united states or from the n-lineage clade a lineage originating from the 20052006 influenza season and continuing to circulate nationwide during the 20072008 season the ha3 gene sequence from a single ah3n2 specimen was found to be most similar to sequence records that nelson et al 11 associated with the 20062007 minor clade b this minor clade b to represents a subpopulation of amantadine-sensitive ah3n2 strains in contrast to the resistant phenotype of the strains with the majority of circulating n- and a-clade strains at least five loci in the m2 trans-membrane peptide-encoding region of influenza virus m gene have been reported to confer some level of in vitro amantadine resistance 12 13 this suggested examination of the rpm assay-generated m gene sequences from these ah3n2-positive specimens to evaluate possible correlations with resistance of the subject isolates to amantadine 
figure 3 shows alignment of m gene sequences from 18 of the 25 ah3n2-positive specimens together representing all three of the clades described by nelson et al 11 the m gene sequences detected by rpm-flu assay of the 24 amantadine-resistant n-lineage or clade-a specimens all reveal -aat- as asparagine n codon 31 of the m2 peptide a genotype consistent with amantadine resistance the matrix gene sequence of the outlier clade-b specimen nhrc393 reveals -agt- as serine s codon 31 of the m2 peptide a genotype consistent with an amantadine-sensitive phenotype the five ah1n1-positive clinical specimens from the ensemble of 298 specimens described in the preceding section were collected between january 2007 and march 2007 at two different military basic training venues army fort jackson sc army fort benning ga blast analysis of the five rpm-flu-detected ha1 gene sequences returned most similar reference sequence records including those that nelson et al 11 associated with ah1n1 major clade a from the 20062007 outbreaks of influenza in the united states global surveillance during the two most recent influenza seasons 20072009 has revealed that most circulating ah1n1 isolates are now resistant to oseltamivir compared with oseltamivir sensitivity of most if not all ah1n1 isolates from the 20062007 influenza season 14 15 updated 13 june 2008 these more recent ah1n1 strains appear to have a resistance phenotype due to mutation at the viral na1 gene h275y locus 16 neuraminidase gene sequences were detected and compared at this locus from rpm-flu assays of specimens from the earlier 20062007 season and more recent 20072008 season specimens provided by nhrc for analysis as shown in the figure 4 the rpm-flu assay-generated na1 gene sequences from the older ensemble of clinical specimens 20062007 were concordant with those of the oseltamivir-sensitive anew caldedonia201999 h1n1 rpm-flu detector tile strain blast analysis of these na1 gene sequences returned most similar records including the oseltamivir-sensitive aohiour06-05912007 and aoregonur06-06092007 strains the  symbol in the inset indicates the c-t transition mutation corresponding to the h275y mutation on the other hand the examples shown in the bottom half of the inset representing 20072008 oseltamivir-resistant specimens from nhrc had runs of 10 to 20 uncalled bases n spanning the na1 genes h275y oseltamivir resistance locus these results do not explicitly corroborate the h275y resistance genotype although they are consistent with diminished re-sequencing efficiency at sites of mismatching detector tile and specimen gene sequences these runs of n-calls suggest two or more proximal nucleotide mismatches may be present at this na1 gene locus of the selected nhrc 2008 specimens there were 115 most similar sequence records returned by blast for the three full-length rpm-flu assay-generated na1 gene sequences and five of these sequence records indicated a second h275y-proximal mutation at positions of asterisks on either side of the  symbol any such pair of proximal mismatches in a specimen gene sequence template could disrupt hybridization of the sets of 25-nucleotide oligomer probes used to determine basecalls by the rpm-flu re-sequencing method future iterations of the rpm-flu microarray design could provide one or more alternative na1 gene sequence detector subtiles such assay design iterations would enable future rpm-flu assays to deliver more explicit first-assay characterization of the oseltamivir genotype and phenotype an isolate of subtype ah1n1 and another of subtype ah3n2 were selected by nhrc for single-passage propagation in mdck cell cultures followed by infectivity titrations in replicate shell vial cultures the resulting neat stocks of brd10622nh1n1 and brd10601h3n2 were determined to contain 316107 tcid50ml and 178107 tcid50ml respectively these two titered stocks were used to determine the analytical sensitivity of the rpm-flu by blinded assays of samples extracted from triplicate three-fold serial dilutions in the range of 11000 to 12187000 background c3 scores were used as thresholds for reporting detection of either ah1n1 or ah3n2 in these limit dilution assays as opposed to the relaxed and stringent thresholds used for reporting results from assays of clinical or field specimens the background detector tiles represent 25 non-ah1n1 and non-ah3n2 detector tiles from each individual rpm-flu assay and a positive detection was reported if one of the target-specific detector tiles from the following lists had c3 score at least 329 standard deviations greater than the background mean c3 score p0001

table 6 presents the results for 19 of these 23 specimens reported by the rpm-flu assays to be positive for avian influenza virus in each case the rpm-flu assay-generated ha and na gene sequences

neuraminidase detector tiles in the assay was 3116 n  10 usda16 was correctly negative by rpm-flu assay for avian influenza but unblinding revealed this specimen to be a second negative control containing instead avian paramyxovirus type i newcastle disease virus after receiving this information another aliquot of the same nucleic acid preparation from specimen usda16 was tested using an alternative rpm-tei assay 17 for detecting tropical and emerging infections this assay resulted in successful detection and identification of avian paramyxovirus type 1 specimen usda23 was received later as a substitute for the failed inoculum specimen usda5 the rpm-flu assay of this specimen resulted in detection of sequence for neuraminidase type n4 with most similar sequence record representing an ah8n4 strain however no hemagglutinin gene sequences were detected that met even the relaxed detection threshold the highest c3 scores among all rpm-flu hemagglutinin detector tiles were ha1h1n1-1918 a very short detector tile and fluaha7 but neither of these sub-threshold results triggered a positive detection report lin et al 2009 recently reported another study of avian influenza viruses using rpm-flu assays for 24 ah5n1-positive field and clinical specimens collected by the namru-3 group from infected birds and humans 18 supplemental table s5 summarizes results from our re-analysis of their original rpm-flu assay data gseq fasta files presenting c3 scores as described in this report for assay-generated sequences from the subtype-specific ha and na detector tiles or from the rpm-flu m ns and pb2 detector tiles that represent conserved gene sequences of a prototype ah5n1 strain the rpm-flu assay-generated ha5 gene sequences of all the ah5n1-positive specimens

unequivocal diagnostic detection and identification of human and avian influenza virus subtypes based upon direct determination of specimen-specific sequences of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes the two negative control specimens usda13 and usda16 demonstrated the capability of the rpm-flu assay to identify alternative pathogens to avian influenza virus as components of a more complete differential diagnosis assay for cases of avian influenza-like illness the results presented in table 6 demonstrated 19 of 19 reference strains of type a avian influenza viruses detected and correctly identified by corresponding ahn subtype based upon the specific ha and na gene sequences revealed in the assays of each specimen the same assays also generated specimen-specific m ns andor pb2 gene sequences we used these results to poll the ahn subtypes of the influenza virus strains corresponding to blast-returned sequence records found to be most similar to these relatively conserved non-ha and non-na gene sequences supporting information - table s6 table s7 table s8 blast analysis of the m gene sequences from the 19 avian influenza specimens returned 79 most similar sequence records of which 40 51 were associated with different ahn subgroups than determined from the corresponding specimens ha and na gene sequences for five of the 19 specimens there were no most similar m gene sequences returned to match the specimens actual ahn subtype table s6 blast analysis of the ns gene sequences from the 19 avian influenza specimens returned 63 most similar sequence records of which 41 65 were associated with different ahn subgroups than determined from the corresponding specimens ha and na gene sequences for five of the 19 specimens there were no most similar ns gene sequences returned to match the specimens actual ahn subtype table s7 blast analysis of the pb2 gene sequences from the 19 avian influenza specimens returned 58 most similar sequence records of which 22 38 were associated with different ahn subgroups than determined from the corresponding specimens ha and na gene sequences nine of the 19 specimens had no most similar pb2 gene sequences from the same ahn subtype table s8 these results suggest little predicate value of most type a influenza virus m ns or pb2 sequences for determination of the ahn subtype of the strain from which these sequences were identified we referred earlier to the complementary set of field and clinical samples isolates not original specimens of type a avian influenza viruses provided by namru-3 cairo egypt and analyzed at nrl using rpm-flu 18 as noted earlier table s5 in supplemental information presents the c3 scores from rpm-flu assay-generated gene sequences data for these specimens eight samples from this previously referenced set of clinical and field specimen isolates of avian influenza virus represented subtypes ah10n7 4 ah7n7 2 ah11 1 or ah13 1 in marked contrast to results from rpm-flu assay-generated ha and na gene sequences there was poor correspondence of the actual specimen ahn subtypes with the subtypes of sequence records returned from blast analysis of the assay-generated m and ns gene sequences of 30 most similar m gene sequence records only 5 were from ahn subtypes matching the subtypes of the corresponding specimens table s6 none of the 11 most similar ns gene sequence records matched the ahn subtypes of the corresponding specimens table s7 there were no pb2 gene sequences reported from assays of these eight non-ah5n1 specimens table s5 twenty-one of the remaining specimens of the set reported by lin et al 18 were of subtype ah5n1 and the rpm-flu assay results for these specimens are also included in table s1 as c3 scores for the sequences generated from the corresponding ha5 na1 m ns and pb2 gene detector tiles for these 21 ah5n1-positive specimens the blast analyses of assay-generated m ns and pb2 gene sequences exclusively represented subtype ah5n1 avian influenza viruses as 255 m gene 146 ns gene and 310 pb2 gene sequence records this result for ah5n1strains is reminiscent of the results presented earlier for subtypes ah1n1 and ah3n2 and type b human influenza virus sequence records that are found to be most similar to rpm-flu assay-generated m ns and pb2 gene sequences from the corresponding types and subtypes it is interesting to consider that these results may reflect the highly biased over-representation of samples ah5n1 sequences in the genome sequence databases reflecting much more of the natural diversity of non-ha and non-na gene sequences than in more sparsely sampled but naturally far more prevalent avian influenza virus subtypes the rpm-flu assay leverages a multiplexed rt-pcr-like strategy to rapidly 1 hour amplify trace quantities of specific target gene sequences so that they may be detected if actually present in a specimen results from this report demonstrated that the 95 endpoint limits of detection lod for seasonal acalifornia-nhrcbrd10622n2009h1n1 and seasonal acalifornia-nhrcbrd10601n2009h3n2 influenza virus strains were 28 infectious doses tcid50 and 58 tcid50 respectively these strains have not been serially passaged at high multiplicity in either egg or mdck cell cultures so it is not likely that accumulations of defective viral particles would favorably bias determination of sensitivity with genome-based assays relative to infectious doses furthermore these two strains were not selected a priori for favorable match of viral sequences with oligonucleotide primers used for target gene sequence amplification the observed rpm-flu lod for each strain is of similar order of magnitude as comparable estimates of analytical sensitivity reported from rt-pcr based methods table 7 each rpm assay of a single specimen is capable of generation from hundreds to thousands of nucleotides of multiple targeted pathogen gene sequences gene sequences generated directly from rpm-flu assays may specify determinants of particular target pathogen phenotypes virulence drug resistance host range etc or support forensic queries of identity of detected strains in different specimens or support genome diversity-based epidemiological tracking in the course of an infectious disease outbreak rpm-flu assay-generated nucleotide sequences representing one or more target genes of each detected pathogen convey significantly more informative specificity than can be obtained from any singlet or multiples of rt-pcr tests some rt-pcr protocols are designed to glean additional detail regarding detected pathogen genotypes through results from multiple serially executed rt-pcr panels but this approach imposes additional testing costs and time delays and yield far less specific information than actual target gene sequences provided from a single rpm assay some platforms claim to differentiate selected type a influenza virus subtypes based upon indirect detection or specification of non-ha and non-na viral gene sequences 21 22 results in this report of rpm-flu assay-generated viral gene sequences from a variety of reference strains indicate that matrix m gene sequences are correlated with the subtypes of only seasonal human ah1n1 and seasonal ah3n2 strains in general however non-ha and non-na viral gene sequences do not support reliable inference of type a influenza virus subtype the rpm-flu assay panel simultaneously addresses 30 different categories of viruses and bacteria that are more or less likely to be encountered in specimens related to respiratory infections figure 1 figure s1 each assay simultaneously enables detection and identification of targeted pathogens from one or more of 188 different target gene resequencing detector tiles for comparison the recently fda-cleared luminex respiratory viral panel rvp multiplex nucleic acid detection assay respiratory virus panel 510k k063765 is a twelve-plex rt-pcr panel for detection and differentiation of a few strains and types of respiratory viruses including adenovirus influenza a virus as ah1 or ah3 respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenza virus metapneumovirus and rhinovirus no bacterial respiratory pathogens tested the rvp assay yields no specimen-specific viral gene sequences that could be used for more detailed identification and differentiation of detected virus strains and variants of detected viruses for human and avian type a influenza viruses in particular the rpm-flu provides direct detection and identification capability for any of the combinatorial 144 ahn subtypes that may be present in a specimen using an ensemble of 39 different influenza virus target gene resequencing detectors the luminex rvp multiplex rt-pcr panel uses three of its twelve primer-probe sets to detect type a influenza virus m gene-specific primer pair and distinguish ah1 from ah3 ha1- and ha3-specific primer pairs while this rt-pcr panel may infer influenza virus subtype not even testing for the na component the assay result is only based on a pattern of signals from a small panel of rt-pcr primer-probes some rt-pcr protocols require serial analysis with hierarchical panels of primer-probes in order to expand the practical multiplicity of pathogen targets or variants this is the case with the benchmark pcr testing used in this report a type a influenza virus-positive specimen may be identified in a first round rt-pcr panel followed by testing with another panel to distinguish ah1 from ah3 failure to establish subtype ah1 or ah3 in the follow-on test is a first tier screening results for possible identification of the 2009 novel ah1n1 influenza virus outbreak strain according to the fact sheet for healthcare providers interpreting cdc human influenza virus real-time rt-pcr detection and characterization panel for respiratory specimens nps ns ts npsts na1 and viral culture test results authorized by fda 02 may 2009 it is not at all clear that such hierarchical rt-pcr protocols attempting to increase analytical multiplicity through serial testing of the same specimens at different laboratory venues over a period likely longer than a single day can be either efficient or cost-effective far more diagnostic intelligence about the patient and specimen would be available in first-day same-day results from a single rpm-flu test of the original specimen influenza infections do not necessarily preclude co-infection of the same individual by other viral andor bacterial pathogens including other strains of influenza virus such co-infections may confound a simple diagnosis of influenza and may also compound morbidity and mortality for a co-infected patient however it is not common practice that a positive result from a routine diagnostic influenza test would be followed by a call for one or more tests of possible secondary agents of infection the single specimen single aliquot rpm-flu assay simultaneously targets 30 different categories of viruses and bacteria and these were each selected as a respiratory pathogens reported to cause flu-like symptoms at some stage of human infection implementation of a highly multiplexed differential diagnostic assay as rpm-flu would be of great advantage in anticipation of highly likely future influenza outbreaks epidemics and pandemics for many decades leaders in the area of influenza epidemic and pandemic risk assessment and outbreak management have reviewed the pathology of influenza with respect to rapid deterioration and patient deaths attributable to secondary bacterial infections and pneumonia 23 24 it has taken almost twenty-five years from the first research reports of the polymerase chain reaction 25 until recent regulatory clearances have enabled introduction specific pcr- and rt-pcr-based diagnostic assays and instrumentation into clinical practice such a traditional regulatory clearance timeline may assure safety and efficacy of diagnostic devices beyond imaginable limits of liability but it also assures that best practice standards for clinical diagnostics are constrained to technologies that perform with nearly obsolete capabilities and specifications within the last decade resequencing microarrays have been introduced for research applications and clinical research 26 27 28 it would be disappointing to anticipate that another decade or more may pass before benefits from diagnostic implementations of rpm or other highly multiplexed sequencing-based platforms can be realized in routine clinical diagnostics  the clinical impact of coronavirus infection in patients with hematologic malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients morgan hakki rogan rattray m richard press d   the clinical significance of respiratory viruses such as influenza respiratory syncytial virus rsv parainfluenza viruses pivs human metapneumovirus hmpv rhinovirus rhv and adenovirus adv in patients with hematologic malignancies or recipients of autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant hsct is well described 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 far less data have been published that specifically address the impact of coronavirus cov infection in these patients 9 lower respiratory tract disease lrtd due to cov has been described on a case-report level 10 11 12 13 14 but a retrospective analysis of 46 bronchoalveolar lavage bal samples obtained from hsct recipients with any acute pulmonary process did not identify cov in any sample 3 later a prospective surveillance study in allogeneic hsct recipients performed at a single center over the course of one year found a relatively high cumulative incidence of cov infection 11 in the first 100 days following allogeneic hsct but only one case in which cov was detected in a lower respiratory tract sample 15 other series studying the impact of respiratory viral infections have not specifically or directly assessed the clinical impact of cov in patients with hematologic malignancies and hsct recipients 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 with an apparently high frequency of infection but relative paucity of information pertaining to the impact of cov in patients with hematologic malignancies and hsct recipients we conducted a retrospective review of all cov infections at our institution over a three year period in order to further characterize the role of cov in respiratory tract infections in these patients all nasopharyngeal np and bal samples submitted from outpatient clinics and inpatient wards for respiratory virus testing between june 01 2010 and july 01 2013 at oregon health and science university ohsu were included in this study demographic and clinical information pertaining to each patient testing positive for cov or other respiratory viruses assayed as part of a multiplex pcr panel described below were obtained by medical chart review a patient was considered to have a hematologic malignancy if they were diagnosed with and were receiving treatment for any type of leukemia lymphoma multiple myeloma aplastic anemia mastocytosis myelodysplastic syndrome or amyloidosis all patients who underwent allogeneic or autologous hsct or cord blood transplant cbt were included and classified as such regardless of the underlying disease necessitating transplant testing was performed using a multiplex respiratory virus pcr panel assay xtag rvp luminex 23 per manufacturers instructions since this assay does not distinguish between rhv and enterovirus env these results are grouped together in this analysis the cov pcr reagents that are included in the rvp testing kit were further validated for clinical testing under college of american pathologists cap- and clinical laboratory improvement amendments clia- regulatory conditions by the ohsu molecular diagnostics lab a unique episode of infection was counted at the initial identification of a respiratory virus in an np or bal sample when the same respiratory virus was identified in multiple consecutive samples from the same patient without interim negative test results this was considered as representative of prolonged shedding and was therefore counted as a single unique episode of infection mortality was attributed to respiratory virus infection if death was due to respiratory failure without identification of a cause other than a respiratory virus 19 respiratory virus inpatient-acquired infection was defined as onset of new symptoms 4 days or more after admission to an inpatient ward criteria for possible and proven lrtd were identification of a respiratory virus in an np sample possible lrtd or bal sample proven lrtd along with new pulmonary infiltrates on thoracic imaging 24 comparison of categorical variables between viral groups was performed using two-tailed fishers exact test a total of 1661 np and bal samples obtained from the general hospital inpatient and outpatient populations - inclusive of but not limited to hsct recipients and hematologic malignancy patients - were analyzed of these 631 samples 38 submitted during 461 unique episodes of infection tested positive for a respiratory virus table 1
 cov was the third most-common virus identified after rhvenv and piv3 accounting for 43 68 positive samples three bal specimens were positive for cov see below representing 7 of all cov-positive samples of the 461 unique episodes of infection 339 735 were in the hematologic malignancy and hsct patient populations table 1 cov was identified in 38 82 episodes among all patients and 33 97 of episodes among hematologic malignancy and hsct patients 19 575 of the 33 episodes of cov infection in the hsct and hematologic malignancy population were diagnosed during the winter months of decembermarch fig 1
 38 samples from the 33 hematologic malignancy and hsct patients tested positive for cov with the majority 763 being group i subtypes nl63 n  15 and 229e n  14 as compared to group ii subtypes oc43 n  5 and hku1 n  4 30 of the 38 789 cov positive samples were positive only for cov and the other 8 samples were co-infected with rhv 4 rsv a 2 hmpv 1 and both rsv a and adv 1 in order to better define the role of cov in respiratory tract syndromes among patients with hematologic malignancies and hsct recipients we limited our clinical analysis to patients infected only with cov excluding those co-infected with other respiratory viruses table 2
 29 patients were infected only with cov and of those 28 965 had an underlying hematologic malignancy n  8 or had undergone allogeneic n  15 or autologous n  5 hsct the clinical characteristics of cov infection in these 28 patients were examined and compared to episodes of mono-infection with other respiratory viruses piv1-4 hmpv rsv and rhvenv in the same patient population the median age of those infected with cov was similar to the other respiratory viruses analyzed surprisingly cov was identified significantly more often in females 64 than males compared to hmpv piv1-4 and rhvenv with a trend toward the same finding for rsv five episodes of cov infection 178 were hospital-acquired four of these cases all subtype nl63 occurred on the same inpatient hsctoncology ward within a 60 day period between january 27 and march 24 2012 while indicative of an epidemiological link we were unable to conclusively prove this according to surveillance performed as part of ohsus infection control program during this time period only two other cases of nosocomial acquisition of a respiratory virus occurred on this ward  one rhvenv and one influenza a personal communication dr lynne strasfeld of cases acquired as an outpatient 7 304 required admission to the hospital typically for evaluation of fevers or new pulmonary infiltrates the requirement for hospitalization during cov infection was not significantly different from those during infection with other respiratory viruses similar to most other respiratory viruses the majority of patients 857 in whom cov was detected had uri symptoms rhinorrhea congestion or sore throat however evidence of lrtd such as cough and new radiographic abnormalities was observed less frequently during cov infection with a trend toward less hypoxemia as well three patients 107 all allogeneic hsct recipients met criteria for possible cov lrtd table 2 table 3
 based on the identification of cov from an np specimen and new radiographic abnormalities 24 significantly less than during infection with the other respiratory viruses except rhvenv none of these patients underwent bronchoscopy two patients both allogeneic hsct recipients met criteria for proven lrtd based on identification of cov in a bal sample along with new radiographic abnormalities table 2 table 3 24 however one of these patients also had rsv adv and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus identified in the bal specimen making the contribution of cov to lrtd unclear the combined incidence of possible and proven lrtd was significantly lower during cov infection compared to all of the other respiratory viruses analyzed except rhvenv four of the five cases of possible or proven lrtd occurred after day 100 following hsct and all five were associated with acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease gvhd a third episode of proven lrtd accounting for the third cov-positive bal table 1 occurred in a patient who had not undergone hsct and did not have an underlying hematologic malignancy characteristics of that case were therefore not further analyzed there were no cases in which mortality was directly attributable to cov infection the results presented here complement and expand upon the few existing studies evaluating the role of cov infection in the immunocompromised host 15 16 17 25 cov primarily group i subtypes was frequently identified in the hsct and hematologic malignancy populations when suspicion for a respiratory viral infection prompted diagnostic testing in this population cov infection was associated with similar rates of uri symptoms nosocomial acquisition and requirement for hospital admission compared to most other respiratory viruses however cov infection resulted in less possible and proven lrtd than other respiratory viruses with the exception of rhvenv the frequency of detection of cov among all samples tested in this study is consistent with previous reports of cov detection in patients hospitalized with respiratory syndromes 15 16 17 however our results may not reflect the true prevalence of cov infection in our patients as we do not routinely screen asymptomatic patients doing so would most likely increase the prevalence of infection due to detection in asymptomatic shedders 15 it is also important to note that the true rate of influenza a and b infection is under-represented in our results since the initial test of choice for these pathogens at our institution is an influenza-specific pcr assay not the respiratory virus panel used in this study accounting for this would reduce the relative frequency of cov as well as that of all other non-influenza respiratory viruses we found that the hematologic malignancy and hsct populations accounted for the majority of patients testing positive for cov and the other respiratory viruses this finding almost certainly reflects testing bias in that these patients are more likely to be tested for respiratory viruses when symptomatic given the importance placed on these pathogens 9 interestingly we also found a female-predominant gender distribution among those infected with cov which to the best of our knowledge has not been reported before 15 16 17 25 26 while the frequency of respiratory illnesses in the general population has been described to be higher among females perhaps due to increased exposure 27 if this was responsible for the higher burden of cov infection among women compared to men then a similar pattern might be expected for the other respiratory viruses as well this finding requires confirmation by additional studies the majority 763 of cov identified in the hematologic malignancy and hsct patients in this study belongs to group i similarly group i covs have been associated with infection in the immunocompromised host more than group ii covs in several series and case reports 12 13 15 26 28 in contrast studies involving general or pediatric patient populations have reported a majority of cov belonging to group ii 16 17 25 26 29 30 31 32 group i and ii covs differ in the mechanism of virus entry into the host cell and the degree of genetic variability but whether these differences affect pathogenicity is not known 33 indeed reports associating cov subtypes with disease manifestations are conflicting 17 26 31 further studies into the relative incidence of cov subtypes among various patient populations are necessary and may provide insight into fundamental biological differences between group i and ii subtypes similar to previous reports 3 15 the rate of cov-proven lrtd was low but was not significantly different from other respiratory viruses however these results must be interpreted with caution since bronchoscopy which we used as a criteria for defining proven lrtd is no longer done in many cases when a respiratory virus is identified in an upper airway sample at this institution or others 24 analyzing possible lrtd instead cov was indeed associated with significantly less disease compared to all the other respiratory viruses analyzed except rhvenv with the rate of possible lrtd due to the other respiratory viruses in this report being generally consistent with the published literature 9 24 however not all patients had radiography performed at the time of diagnosis of respiratory viral infection which may bias the results toward those more likely to have evidence of lower respiratory tract illness interestingly all cases of possible and proven cov-associated lrtd occurred in hsct recipients whereas the cases of possible and proven lrtd during infection with the other respiratory viruses were divided more evenly among hsct recipients and hematologic malignancy patients additionally all cases occurred in the setting of acute or chronic gvhd taken together these findings suggest that cov may be inherently less virulent compared to other respiratory viruses and therefore requires augmented immune suppression after hsct in order to progress to lrtd the low number of cov-associated lrtd in this study precludes meaningful risk factor assessment but additional studies may make this more feasible aside from lrtd cov infection was associated with other clinically-relevant consequences namely 30 of outpatients were admitted to the hospital based on manifestations of cov infection and hospital acquisition occurred in 5 cases with a cluster of 4 nosocomially-acquired cases occurring within a 2 month span additionally 50 of cov-infected patients received an empiric course of antibacterial therapy data not shown notably while cov is detected as part of the respiratory virus panel used at our institution during the study period the cov results were not reported in the medical record since the assay was not approved by the food and drug administration for this purpose in theory a negative respiratory virus panel result may lead to more frequent admission to the hospital for further medical evaluation antibacterial use or nosocomial transmission however we found the rates of these events during cov infection to be similar to those during infection with other respiratory viruses table 2 and data not shown highlighting the overall impact of respiratory viral infections in these patients in terms of utilization of medical resources in conclusion we found that cov is detected frequently in patients with hematologic malignancies and hsct recipients in whom suspicion for a respiratory viral infection exists but is associated with less lrtd than other respiratory viruses except rhvenv the retrospective nature of this work mandates confirmation of our findings by additional prospective studies no conflicts of
